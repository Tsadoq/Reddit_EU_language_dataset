Her outfit is based on the actual uniform that Yugoslavian youth wore. Starting from the age of seven, all kids were part of ""Union of Pioneers of Yugoslavia"".

56,"Then why mention

&gt; the Battle of Salamis Never Ended

and 

&gt; rising tensions with Turkey remind Greece of its role as Europe’s gatekeeper

and 

&gt; But just days before the performance at Epidauros, Greece braced for a repetition of the battle itself.

and

&gt; Ever since Salamis, the Greeks have considered themselves Europe’s eastern gatekeeper.

and

&gt; At this summer’s performance of “The Persians,” the audience erupted with applause when the Persian queen Atossa asked of the Greeks, “Who is their master and commander of their armies?” and the chorus leader answered, “They call themselves nobody’s slaves, nor do they obey any man.”

and

&gt; At the time, a former head of the air force, whose pension was halved thanks to budget cuts, said to me: “Don’t they remember Salamis? Don’t they remember Marathon? Aren’t those wars worth some consideration today? Couldn’t the Europeans cut us some slack for protecting them then?”

and

&gt; Now, as in 480 B.C., the Greeks face a superior foe. Against Turkey’s new fleet of frigates, Greece fields ships that are up to 50 years old. Unlike Themistocles, the current government can’t afford a rearmament program. In July, a deal to purchase two state-of-the-art French frigates for $3.3 billion was called off as too expensive.

Seems pretty clear to me that the author is trying to connect the two instances *beyond* sharing the same geographical space. It's why he emphasizes Greece's role as a gatekeeper, or points to similar politics. 

The current crisis isn't taking place anywhere near salamis and only shares very few, superficial, characteristics. It being naval in nature (there hasn't been a battle) and one of the sides inhabit Greece.

232,"&gt; I'm sorry but how exactly is it, in any way, Russia's business, where Estonia places its monuments? This would be perceived as imperialist in any country, but even more so in context of Russia which knows very well how Soviet Union is seen in Baltics. Secondly, this entire idea of ""feeding countries"" reeks of the insane Putinist rhetorics. Trade is mutually beneficial and boils down to enterprises acting on supply and demand. It's standard market economy.

The transfer of the monument took place in the broader context of the glorification of Nazi collaborators. I hope you know how painful the Russians are to the Nazis and their collaborators? 24 000 000 dead.

But You are right, moving the monument is an internal matter for Estonia, and regulating cargo flows is an internal matter for Russia.

The free market is good. Market advantage and all that. And just in this paradigm, it is profitable to develop your ports and transfer cargo through them.

So, what are your complaints about Russia, which is doing exactly this? Only business.

&gt;EU applied sanctions to a country that's already the world's largest and yet literally invaded and annexed land from its smaller neighbour and sent military aid to rebels there. Russia applied sanctions to a 100 times smaller neighbour for relocating a controversial monument in its own capital (!). I don't think they're even nearly comparable. 

Well, the fact that the EU hates other people's freedom and therefore does not accept the decision of the residents of the Republic of Crimea, it is well known. But what's wrong with helping the rebels? Isn't that what NATO did in Syria and Libya?

And the question is not in size, but in principle. And your ""this is not comparable"" is already a meme in Russia, in response to hypocrisy.

and then, about your pathetic words. Your reasoning is certainly interesting, although sometimes ridiculous and illogical. For example, ""Belarusian TV workers who have rebelled"" can only Express the opinion of TV workers, not the entire Belarusian people.

269,"**For Greece, the Battle of Salamis Never Ended**

*On the 2,500th anniversary of a historic Athenian victory, rising tensions with Turkey remind Greece of its role as Europe’s gatekeeper*

&gt; It’s unusual for a modern Greek audience to punctuate an ancient tragedy with applause. But in July, a production of Aeschylus’ “The Persians” by the National Theatre of Greece, presented in the splendor of the ancient theater of Epidauros, was applauded three times on its final night, with the prime minister in attendance. The play relates the Greeks’ stunning victory at the naval battle of Salamis in 480 B.C., where 300 Greek ships defeated an invading Persian fleet four times larger. The historic triumph secured Athenian naval power in the Aegean and established Athenian-inspired democracies across Greece.

&gt; The performance was one of several celebratory events planned for the 2,500th anniversary of Salamis. Amid fears of a second wave of coronavirus, Greek authorities aren’t sure how many of them will come to fruition by Sept. 29, the presumed date of the battle. But just days before the performance at Epidauros, Greece braced for a repetition of the battle itself.

&gt; On July 21, Turkey announced that its seismic survey ship, the Oruc Reis, would cross into Greek waters to look for undersea oil and gas. For two days, the Greek and Turkish navies deployed in battle positions across the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean, before a German intervention led Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to announce that the mission would be postponed. Tension over maritime territory has been building for years in the Aegean, and few, if any, Greeks believe the danger to have peaked. On Aug. 13, Greece held joint naval and air force exercises in the Aegean with France, the only EU country that seems prepared to offer military assistance in the event of war. And Greece continues to seek military assistance from Israel, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.

&gt; Ever since Salamis, the Greeks have considered themselves Europe’s eastern gatekeeper. Aeschylus, himself a veteran of the battle, stressed the difference between the political systems of democratic Athens and monarchical Persia. At this summer’s performance of “The Persians,” the audience erupted with applause when the Persian queen Atossa asked of the Greeks, “Who is their master and commander of their armies?” and the chorus leader answered, “They call themselves nobody’s slaves, nor do they obey any man.”

&gt; But of course the Greeks, too, had a chain of command. The architect of the victory at Salamis was the young Athenian general Themistocles, who neutralized the Persians’ numerical superiority by forcing them to fight in the confines of the narrow strait between the island of Salamis and the port of Piraeus. Using strategic deception, Themistocles sent a messenger to inform Xerxes, the Persian king, that the Greek fleet was about to flee under cover of darkness. The ancient historian Herodotus tells us that Xerxes’ ships blockaded the strait and his men sat at oar all night. In the morning, a section of the Greek fleet feinted at escape; the bleary-eyed Persians pursued them, believing they were moving in for the kill. Once the Persian fleet was massed inside the strait, their quarry turned and attacked, while the rest of the Greek fleet moved in from the flanks.

&gt; Recent archaeological discoveries have revealed that Themistocles’ leadership in peacetime was just as great as his generalship in war. An excavation in Piraeus by the Danish Institute has unearthed the sheds that housed the Athenian attack ships, called triremes because of their three banks of oarsmen. Bjorn Lovén, who leads the excavation, found potsherds in the foundations of the sheds which, he says, date them to the two decades before or after the battle. Mr. Lovén believes it “very likely” that the sheds were part of a 200-trireme rearmament program that Themistocles instigated three years before the battle, after a particularly rich silver vein was discovered at the Athenian state mines in Laurion.

&gt; Mr. Lovén’s discoveries, which will be part of a commemorative Salamis exhibition at the Hellenic Maritime Museum in September, reinforce ancient accounts of Themistocles as not only a master strategist but a visionary politician who created the Athenian navy and cemented Athenian democracy. “All social classes rowed and fought from triremes at the Battle of Salamis. I strongly believe that this pivotal battle created an immensely strong bond among the majority of Athens’ citizens. This is how the navy would develop into the backbone of Athenian democracy,” writes Mr. Lovén in a research paper being published this autumn.

&gt; As Athens gave way to later empires—Macedon, Rome, Byzantium—the Aegean continued to mark the effective border between Europe and Asia. That geopolitical fault line has been dormant since 1923, when the Treaty of Lausanne settled the borders of modern Greece and Turkey. But it is now grinding back to life, like an undersea tectonic plate, as Turkey seeks to push its maritime boundaries deep into the Mediterranean.

&gt; The movement of refugees from Asia and Africa has been another flashpoint. In March, the Turkish government reversed a longstanding policy and encouraged asylum seekers to cross the Greek border into the EU. The policy played well in Turkey, where public opinion is fed up with almost 4 million refugees, but it drove a wedge in EU-Turkish relations and generated sympathy—and some border assistance—for Greece.

&gt; When the global financial crisis bankrupted Greece in 2010, the country’s Eurozone partners extended emergency loans on the strict condition that it balance its budget. At the time, a former head of the air force, whose pension was halved thanks to budget cuts, said to me: “Don’t they remember Salamis? Don’t they remember Marathon? Aren’t those wars worth some consideration today? Couldn’t the Europeans cut us some slack for protecting them then?”

&gt; This view is widely held in Greece, especially today, when the country spends as much on repaying its Western creditors as it does on defense. Now, as in 480 B.C., the Greeks face a superior foe. Against Turkey’s new fleet of frigates, Greece fields ships that are up to 50 years old. Unlike Themistocles, the current government can’t afford a rearmament program. In July, a deal to purchase two state-of-the-art French frigates for $3.3 billion was called off as too expensive.

&gt; Today the Salamis strait is an industrial zone, lined with shipyards and freight terminals. At one end sits Greece’s main naval base, on the other, Athens’s sewage treatment plant. Only on the island of Salamis itself is there any trace of the battle: A bronze statue of two warriors, erected in 2006, stands on the mound where the dead were buried in 480 B.C. But Greece does manage to put some of its money where its glory is. In honor of the anniversary, the island of Salamis, after which the battle is named, is being relieved of a $3 million water bill that the municipality couldn’t pay.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/imb7ne/for_greece_the_battle_of_salamis_never_ended/g3yg6wr/,Ostanis,1599202427

569,"Russia has taken significant steps to harden it's defences against the West. They've thrown everything at it, sanctions, economic thugery by threathening other countries dealing with Russia among others yet life goes on normally in Russia.

The interesting thing about the sanctions is that it has actually helped Russia realise a lot of home grown economic activity. For the first time, farmers, local producers and manufacturing of high tech equipments are flooded with demand internally. It has forced it to look within itself rather than take the easy route of just importing it from the EU. In a matter of a year, Russia became the largest wheat exporter in the world for example. They produced so much agriculture that it overtook the arms industry as earner. Exports to new markets opened up and suddenly the local economy is starting to revitalise. 

The export subsitution program also meant that Western companies in Russia were forced to localise production. For example Siemens which produces large and highly technical turbines in Russia stopped importing parts from Germany and started engaging local production companies to produce those, therein sharing critical technology transfer with the aim of 100% localisation. I don't know about you but if I were Russia, this sanctions thing whilst in the short term may seem disruptive, in the long term could actually be it's salvation.",,/r/europe/comments/im0sd5/alexei_navalny_germany_urges_eu_action_over/g3xkg5p/,thekremlinbot,1599181515

And now you will probably think that Greece has the right of asking for an unilateral surrender since Greece holds the right of that EEZ. Well then I ask, based on what do you have that right? On a treaty not signed by Turkey nor enforced by UN? Good luck.  

Instead we can negotiate and get a fair solution, ofc not the Mavi Vatan, but a fairer solution we can both live with. It is not that Greece is going to “give away” their right.

The king made sure this was done correctly, and he stepped up to defend the constitution when it was threatened. If you think the king could have done more, then go ahead and say what. I can tell you how he could have done less.

876,"First, thank you for writing a thorough reaction. It seems that your ideals are, like mine, a socialist and humane society, free from the chains of oppression. 

&gt;Marx criticized … that they would merely compromise with the capital and, if they didn't went further and break the social right of capitalists to exist, it would go back to their face at some point. Like if the bourgeois had compromised with the nobles on some points while maintaining their feudal rights. Society would still be feudal.

I don’t think this was Marx’s view. He believed that the victory of the bourgeoisie over the feudalists was as necessary as the eventual victory of the proletariat. He describes in the *Communist Manifesto* how:

&gt;The feudal system of industry, under which industrial production was monopolized by close guilds, now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its place. The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle-class; division of labor between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labor in each single workshop. Meantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand, ever rising. 

And as Lassalle concluded:

&gt; Under the system of Guilds, the different branches of industry were marked off from one another in the most exact manner by law, and each master was only allowed to undertake one of them, so that for example, for hundreds of years the tailors who made clothes were engaged in lawsuits with the tailors who mended them, the makers of nails, with the locksmiths, in order to fix the limits which separated their trades. ...
&gt;
&gt;A stage had thus been reached, at which production itself, by its steadily advancing development, had brought into existence instruments of production which were destined to shatter the whole existing system of society ; instruments of production and methods of production, which could find no place or room for development in that system.

Marx described how the replacement of the feudal system by the capitalist system had been an inevitable process, caused by material factors. No negotiations could have prevented the fall of the feudal system. Marx believed the same about capitalism. 

So the criticism is, I believe, from a different angle. What Marx criticizes in the *Gotha Programme* is the *manner* how Lassealleans wanted to achieve a socialist society. Lassalle believed that the path towards communism would be “une question à laquelle travailleront [des générations](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5512499m/f254.item.zoom ).” Marx, for some reason, believed that unlike the transition from feudalism to capitalism, the transition towards socialism would not be a process of centuries, but be accomplished by a revolution of the working class. 

So when you say:

&gt;I think, while Marx probably saw the revolution as some sort of military popular uprising against the state, he was also wrong as it may not demand blood. … In a very lassalian way. Why couldn't it be the same of a socialized mode of production ?

I completely agree. But for dogmatic Marxists this is a deviation from the doctrine. Engels was furious when Bernstein and Kautsky had suggested that he also agreed that socialism could be achieved by peaceful means. Luxemburg also considered it heresy. 

Communist parties who try to ameliorate social conditions are therefore actually unconscious Lassalleans. The communist party of your country is a good example of that, and therefore, based on what I know, one of the best political parties in Europe.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/il6jt7/the_last_photograph_of_karl_marx_taken_in_algiers/g3vv9oc/,YuYuHunter,1599158929

No, from what I read he came here just a week ago.

&gt;If so, you are certain he didn't apply for residency? 
In this week? I'm pretty certain he didn't, but even if he did - it does not matter. He was already persona-non-grata in Lithuania, nobody would have given him one.

&gt;Which ones are the ""numer of reasons"" why the could deny this freedom of movement to an eu resident?

Crimes obviously and being a threat to community and national security. Not sure how's that translated to English exactly, I'm sure you will find it on europa.eu if you'll try.

&gt;do they include ""saying stupid stuff"" or ""antagonizing the government""? I

Depends I suppose. If one is calling citizens of another EU country to overthrow the government, would you say it's a valid reason? I'm not saying he did it, but from what I understand he said a lot of stupid shit while he was teaching in Kaunas.

As for official reason why he was declared persona-non-grata - in my 2mins google search I did not find one, usually they do not announce these reasons publicly. If I were to guess I would say it's because he visited Donbas and or Crimea from the Russian side. It's pretty much an automatic ban. Officially people should ask for permit from the Ukrainian government, according to Lithuanian government position. Another possibility might be his communist stance.

962,"&gt; So I say let the no-deal Brexit happen. Then start anew with a clean slate.

So, the reason that December 31 is significant is because to the extent that economic continuity can be maintained, disruption is reduced.  Like, businesses will lay people off after that point to adapt to the new environment, no-longer-viable businesses will shutter doors, people will start newly-viable businesses, etc.  If one signs a deal down the line that restores some elements of the prior relationship, the actions will have already been taken and the expense of undoing them will be incurred.

Even in the event of no-deal, I expect that there will be people looking at ways to lower barriers on into the future.  The long-term benefits of lower barriers to trade will still be available.  However, if there is serious intent to retain elements of the existing relationship, there is disruption-avoiding short-term value to both sides in committing to it before the transition period ends.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ilp2jm/brexit_talks_barnier_slams_uk_stance_says_britain/g3v9txo/,duisThias,1599151595

Sounds like you don't believe much in the EU.

I too think that the people of each country should solve their own  problems. Us too, and others. But if this is the only thing, then the EU is not very useful, not very real, isn't it? It's just a temporary alliance between countries that have alligned interests. Any time they diverge... no alliance.

It won't work that way. In the very least because people in some countries won't solve their own problems. They just won't, regardless of the fact that the should.

You know, I keep reading things like this. ""If you have proof of such-and-such, call the police"". Ordinary citizens are not investigators, nor they should be.

1194,"TL;DR at the end.

Orbán and his party literally saved the country in 2010. The previous government was absorbed in an internal crisis as the country burned and sank around them, busy looting the treasury so they can outlast the coming ""winter years"" in politics. As soon as they won the elecion they introduced a massive amount of laws that practically lifted the country out of its miserable state.

From 2014 it became a lot more controversial every year, more and more corruption, weird foreign policies, catering to the wrong people is eroding their public support every year. Even though like 2 out of 3 of their laws is good and benefits either the country or the people directly (a massive increase from the 0 out of 3 of the previous government) the remaining third is too controversial and their support has dropped significantly.

There's still no single party that can replace him, just a broad coalition that is likely to implode or sink due to inexperience. From what it looks like Orbán is betting on losing the next election so they can come back stronger than ever and it's probably what is going to happen. The broad coalition includes the fuckers who ruined the country 14 years ago and the rest of the parties have no governing experience. At this point the corruption and the foreign policy is so bad that I personally am willing to see our HDI drop just to see him go.

TL;DR: There is definitely hope that Orbán is going to be replaced, there's not much hope that the replacement is going to be any good. Our international image is going to improve but we're likely going to suffer for it in the long run due to a mismanaged economy and possibly even more corruption.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/il53pg/bulgaria_today_the_government_refuses_to_resign/g3u5dm6/,Nerevaryne,1599137051

1245,"Here's me explaining the idea behind this (see the full thing at https://psychopolitica.substack.com/p/psypol-monthly-aug-2020-part-1):

""In the beginning of July, another reader—Garrett of the Stimulus YT channel—and I produced a little memetic animation, the Russian version of the Lofi Girl.

She is blocking out, with limited success, one of Putin’s Covid addresses with “lofi beats to study / relax to” while trying to read a collection of Cosmist writing. Outside her kitchen window is Kemerovo, and on this side of it is a typical Russian kitchen: a plant on the windowsill, a Christian Orthodox calendar on the wall, a cup of tea that’s getting colder, some cigs and matches, and a tin can for an ashtray. She is nor cheerful.

The idea behind the clip is that Putin’s Covid speeches were less about announcing anti-pandemic policies and more about creating the same kind of mood as these lofi mixes on Youtube. Both audio streams are targeted at an audience that has worrying things on their minds—a deadly disease and its economic consequences in Putin’s case, and college exams or a freelance gig in the case of the beats—and both aim to sooth their audience while keeping it alert and focused on task at hand. Neither are dense with meaningful messages. It’s a vibe.

When I first started writing about this about a month ago, I wanted to do a calligraphic translation of Putin’s opening remarks.

&gt;&gt; Dear Russian citizens, I first addressed you about the threat of the coronavirus infection spreading on March, 25. It's been only three months. Usually, such a period of time—one quarter—flies by fast, sometimes we don't even notice how. But in these, undoubtedly difficult days, weeks and months...

He goes on about the importance of human connection, the kindness of strangers and so on—like a sentimental grandfather who isn’t planning to help, but wants us to know he feels for our struggles.

Navalny remains in a serious condition at the intensive care unit of the Charité Hospital in Berlin. But the identification of Novichok as the poison has already raised serious questions about whether Navalny was the target of a state-orchestrated assassination.
Suspected poisoning of Putin critic was meant to kill him, not to scare him off, chief aide says

Traditionally you wear a bunad, but many people who don't have any that are inherited and can't afford buying one has gone over to dresses and suits.

1450,"You are making some great points and also hard to swallow bites. I do agree to certain extend on some of them.  Maybe I am not seeing further from my own nose but here it is: I don't think it so much of a propaganda as much as confusing situation which creates different extreme opinions in the people. That's like the most important question. I was listening to a discussion on it today. Personally, considering our history I feel like we may lean towards communist or maybe those parties like ""Da, Bulgaria"", ""Ima takuv narod"" and etc. Do we trust them? Of course, not, there is no trust left anymore. The point is to scare them to such extend that they know they will be held accountable. Create a way of constant stream of accountability. Increase education about how the system works because ignorance is not a bliss in this case. It requires a heave and careful worked out structure which is on us the people.

Looking at it now. It doesn't seem like EU was ever the answer for any ex-soviet country. They don't know how to handle us. Anyway, we are going back to the idea that all of us struggle because we have been playing the passive role since SSSR. After '91 we had to handle the transition but we were already sheep taught to work and follow orders. Now you can see that behavior as you said ""begging"" the EU because we are used to a stronger power handling us. We have zero national confidence as a single non-dependent country. On another note I am not sure about the sanctions EU can apply on us but they could be vocal about the issue.  We were already a month into protests when the situation escalated in Belarus and it turned big in the west (talking as someone currently in The States) . EU instantly had something to say about it because they are hungry to destabilize Russia. My point being they never cared about us. It is just a constant war between EU and Russian destabilizing themselves, whatever way possible. It ugly and disgusting. The point of being heard, even though with everything happening now, will probably last at most week or two is it gives some encouragement to people to keep protesting and not let it die down as politicians hope. I know weird way to affect people.

The idea is not to be ""RICH AF"" the next morning but it has been like 13 years. Any changes we have gotten have been to mask our eyes or keep us satisfied enough.  We have already nearly 2 million people abroad and please don't sell me ""they don't care about their country"" crap. It's an ugly nonsense. When it comes to economy we would have a lot to offer if we kept production to a lot of good stuff at home. About IT, I think outsourcing us great but in general whole esatern europe is much more capable when it comes to IT field and probably would surpass the silicon valley in an instant if we could get our shit together.

1590,"France sends a warship and fighter jets to support the Greek and Cypriot navies. President Recep Tayipp Erdogan responds with a warning that Turkey will “take what it is entitled to” in the eastern Mediterranean. German chancellor Angela Merkel’s mediation efforts falter as Turkish and Greek warships collide. Who imagined that the west’s next war might be fought within the Nato alliance? Welcome to the new international disorder.

Those mapping the contours of the international landscape now emerging from the ruins of the Pax Americana should cast a glance at recent events in the eastern Mediterranean. The global picture, of course, is being drawn by great power rivalry between the US and China. But the world is also witnessing the return of regional disorder. In the absence of an American referee, old wounds are being reopened, old enmities revived. 

The ingredients of the new instability — efforts to undermine the status quo by revisionist powers such as China, Russia and Turkey, the US retreat from past commitments and European reluctance to play geopolitical hardball — are on display in the waters of the eastern Mediterranean. The confrontation between Greece and Turkey presents a lesson in just how quickly restraints and accommodations that have been long woven into the regional fabric can fray. 

Flare-ups between Athens and Ankara in this part of the world are scarcely new. Cyprus is an open wound. So too is the disputed reach of the maritime borders of Greece’s Aegean Islands. The discovery of rich undersea gas reserves has sharpened the longstanding tensions. The dash for gas has also drawn in other regional players and, with them, separate animosities. Israel and Egypt are already exploiting their offshore gasfields. Lebanon and Libya have interests. There are joint exploration and production deals to be done, pipelines to be built.

None of the above should necessarily preclude a peaceful carve-up. Not so long ago Europe could have looked to the US. Washington would bang heads in Athens and Ankara and, if things got really tense, send a few ships into the Aegean. Those days have passed. The aircraft carrier the Dwight D Eisenhower was indeed in the Mediterranean in July. Not for so long, though, for anyone to notice.

Ankara has been emboldened by the absence of the US. The competing gas claims have become inextricably tied up with the opposing line-ups in Syria and Libya, and with Mr Erdogan’s drive to promote Turkey as the dominant regional power. The dispute with Greece is enmeshed in this broader regional power play as Turkey seeks to settle old scores, among others, with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. 

Mr Erdogan is not alone in seeking to overturn the status quo. It is a rule of the new global disorder that when the US leaves, Russia will arrive. By backing Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in that country’s civil war, Vladimir Putin secured a strategically important naval base in the Mediterranean. Now the Russian president is staking out Moscow’s interest in the Libyan civil war by backing the rebel leader General Khalifa Haftar. 

The US decision to pull back was not entirely that of President Donald Trump. His predecessor, Barack Obama, was never convinced that vital American interests were at stake in Syria and Libya. What he missed was the ripple effects of his decision. Mr Trump’s behaviour has been inconsistent and indifferent — a signal to everyone to take whatever they can grab. The president likes “strong men” leaders, so Mr Erdogan and Mr Putin get a free pass.
French president Emmanuel Macron’s conclusion that the EU had better take on the responsibility that has been given up by the US is inescapably right. So, too, is his judgment that European governments cannot shy away from hard power when dealing with leaders such as Mr Erdogan. Many of Turkey’s claims defy international law — a position underscored by Ankara’s refusal to join the UN’s convention on the law of the sea.

That is not to say Europe is united. France’s support for Greece happens to match its own drive to sustain its influence in the region. Italy and Spain are keen to avoid a military confrontation. Ms Merkel fears Turkish retaliation against the EU in the form of reopening its borders to allow the flight of Syrian refugees into Europe.
None of these differences are insurmountable. Under the old rules, they would have been subsumed by American intervention. What has changed is that Europeans must now hammer out an agreement among themselves. As long as Mr Erdogan can play one member state off against another, the EU has no leverage.

The answer is an EU policy towards Turkey that matches a tough stance in the eastern Mediterranean — backed up, if necessary, by a show of naval force — with greater economic engagement. In dealing with Turkey there is ample room for both Mr Macron’s military resolve and Ms Merkel’s diplomacy.

Mr Erdogan’s march towards authoritarianism has ensured that the prospect of Turkey joining the EU is as close to zero as it has ever been. That should not preclude better trade and investment relations between neighbours and a longer-term understanding on refugees. The starting point, though, must be an EU ready to think, and act, for itself.",Lake Bled connoisseur,/r/europe/comments/ilnak0/home_truths_in_the_eastern_mediterranean_europe/g3t9mq7/,MelodicBerries,1599109807

1696,"So you have time to binge the internet, but not time too cook a little bit? I'm a univesity student and i also don't have much time/will, and as you can imagine i do not have much things in my kitchen, but i legit take 15 minutes to cook a fast meal with idk rice or pasta, meat  or fish and shrooms or fried eggs, or other faster foods ofc. But i understand you man, i have many friends ho also buy prepackaged food, which isn't so bad, at least here.

 I just think that people's way of eating influences immensely one's life, both the body and mind. 

Perhaps taking say, a day and cook a bit longer, but cook for the next few days, food or even some soup, makes a big difference.

1702,"The winning party of the 2016 elections (PSD) tried to change the laws to basically legalize corruption and to weaken the justice system. 

They partially succeeded and in this process almost a quarter of jailed people were freed before finishing their sentence or received lighter punishments. There were massive weekly protests for two years (sometimes even daily) with thousands of people at least. 

The record was 600000 people protesting in a single night at -10° C. This made them push back a little or delayed their actions. 

The party leader is now in jail and they lost the power (mostly because many MPs moved to the main opposition party - PNL which also has its corruption issues but not like PSD). There are trials in progress for many other party membera accused of money laundry or corruption.

Now PNL is governing but PSD still has the most seats in parliament. Due to covid and the protests from previous years they prefer to stay in opposition. The elections are coming in 3 months and I really hope PSD won't get more than 15% but there are a lot or poor uneducated people that still vote them.

There is a new party of young people that were not involved in politics until recently and have no corruption issues and I hope they will win the elections. At EP elections they got 21% so there is a chance.

1767,"the situation in turkey is a bit like the US, in the past the country had an east-west division because of the geography, one of the reasons why the capital was moved from istanbul was about offsetting this division since reaching the mountainous terrain in eastern anatolia and bringing them services was still hard at the turn of the century

the corrupt capital and politicians only cared about the west because most of them were either settled in there or migrated to those areas, western turkey is always the most connected part of the country with europe and you can see that in their outlook on life, political choices and behavior. 

the problem was the elite ignored the east, dismissed them for years as ignorant, lowly educated peasants and never bothered to shake up the system of land ownership which is kind of like slavery, land is still traded with peasants in some parts of the country and those peasants and their families still had the right to vote and they always voted at the command of their landowners. 

this system collapsed in the 70's, there was a massive internal migration, istanbul's population alone climbed from 1million to 18-19 million today. once they were free from the landowners this new rural minded people were shocked at how the people in the west were living their lives from women being prevalent in economic life to the ""decadent"" lifestyle that they were seeing (from sex before marriage to gay relationships and so on). They retreated to their own communities and basically took refuge in their mosques.

these people were constantly belittled by the so called western elite, they got scolded like kids and turkish secularism was exactly the same as what is practiced in france (laicite)  and these people were the driving factor in erdogans rise to power

actually you can apply this to turkish guest workers that arrived in europe because their evolution was exactly the same. Just like ""secular turkey"" europe failed at integrating this people and just like turkey they escaped to the mosque to preserve their fragile identity from the evils of urban life.

 New generations are now adopting to this cosmopolitan city life and doing much better than their rural minded families so this will only improve with time

Taking advantage of the chaos and the weakened government many small groups rebeled and took control of cities and villages. Some of these groups had mainly greek, armenian and arabian origin.

When Atatürk took charge and reassembeled the army he first fought and won against england, France and greece. Then he cleared the rebel forces still present in the country.

That's the thing most people don't get. IT WAS A FUCKİNG WAR!!! Of course there was deaths and fights but it was to defend our country not for plesure or agenda. 


Hitler killed İNNOCENT jews just because of his agenda which is a big no no. THAT is concidered genocide. But when you compare Turkey trying to defend itself against 8 different countries atacking and invading it from all sides to a GENOCİDE, you cross a line which should not be crossed.

1847,"Thatcher was facing an election she was going to lose. The Argentinian junta was also in political trouble and they sent a tiny force to ""capture"" the Falklands. They quickly realised they'd bitten off more than they can they can chew, and they SUED FOR PEACE through diplomatic channels.

Upon hearing that the junta wanted to back away from war, Thatcher sank the Belgrano in order to put peace out of the question.

Then, as war Prime Minister Thatcher romped back into power, with the gutter press gleefully celebrating the (totally unnecessary) loss of more than a thousand lives.

The Belgrano, by the way, was a WWII relic that posed no serious military threat to anyone. She was rusted out, barely seaworthy, and away from the exclusion zone. She was a training platform not a working warship, sent to sea in a futile act of bravado. The hundreds who died were mostly recruits and sailors in training. Even after the sinking, many of those lives could have been saved if London had said there would be no double-tap. 

(Mrs Thatcher was by far the most corrupt PM in living memory, probably on all UK history. In addition to starting a war to win an election, she did huge arms deals with dictators, particularly in the middle-east, selling them all the arms they wanted provided only they bought them all from her son. He became a billionaire, she concealed this corrupt dealing behind the confidentiality attendant upon meetings of heads of state.

First say things you think people want, then look like you are doing something good, without actually doing it, then just wait, and wait, hope protesters tire out. And lastly resign, wait a bit, and you'll be back in power soon.

That's literally already happened to Boyko Borisov the PM of Bulgaria. He was in power, there were protests, people were hurt by the police, he resigned. Then he got back to power, and here we are. The dance continues.

The rebuilding of the judicial and legal system is indeed what needs to happen. But sadly this requires a detailed plan. And the protests tragically don't have that.

France might be behind you (and remember this map is based on the ""ease of doing business"") but the UK’s education system must be really fucked up to produce people like you

Also the reason it’s harder to do business with France is because you can’t get fired in a day just because your boss wants to. The facts are here, it’s easier to do business with the UK, but that didn’t produce extra wealth for the British.

Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Boko Haram, Al-Shabab....dozens of other salafi jihadi terrorist groups that have caused so much death and destruction globally. They all come from Saudi Arabia spending over 100 billion dollars spreading salafi indoctrination across the globe, creating the ideological backbone of all those terrorist groups. The Saudis have also directly supported some of these salafi jihadi groups across the globe. Hilary Clintons leaked emails showed that the government of Saudi Arabia and Qatar were both directly funding ISIS. Currently they are fighting alongside Al-Qaeda in Yemen, paying millions in salaries to get them to fight for their cause. And yes, the US is aware, and still supports this genocidal war, and is essentially on the same side as Al-Qaeda in Yemen.

https://apnews.com/f38788a561d74ca78c77cb43612d50da/AP-investigation:-Yemen-war-binds-US,-allies,-al-Qaida

&gt; the coalition cut secret deals with al-Qaida fighters, paying some to leave key cities and towns and letting others retreat with weapons, equipment and wads of looted cash, an investigation by The Associated Press has found. Hundreds more were recruited to join the coalition itself.

&gt; These compromises and alliances have allowed al-Qaida militants to survive to fight another day — and risk strengthening the most dangerous branch of the terror network that carried out the 9/11 attacks. Key participants in the pacts said the U.S. was aware of the arrangements and held off on any drone strikes.

The Saudis even supported the MB that you hate as early back as the 60s to thwart secular arab nationalism. They only recently started to dislike them, as they became a threat to their monarchy at home. However, even today, they support the Yemeni MB branch, known as Islah

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Islah_(Yemen)

&gt; Islah is more of a loose coalition of tribal and religious elements than a political party. Its origins are in the Islamic Front, a Muslim Brotherhood affiliated militia funded by Saudi Arabia to combat the Marxist National Democratic Front. The Islamic Front regrouped after the unification of Yemen in 1990 under the banner of the Islah Party with considerable financial backing from Saudi Arabia.

People seem to read some kind of different message from a different dimension or something, because i most definitively didn't say that marxism is the best ideology, i didn't even say it is good.

This kinda proves my point, you can't even mention Marx positively without people calling you a communist and a stalinist (see other responses too).

2038,"&gt; uniquely Russian poisons  

I swear I'm not baiting, I'd love to have a discussion on this without being labelled a troll/bot/proofster/whatever. 

Back in 2018, two professional Russian phone prankers called Ahmet Üzümcü, the then-Director General of the [OPCW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_the_Prohibition_of_Chemical_Weapons). [Here is the recording, it's in English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhGLJ82rAFs&amp;feature=emb_title). In it, the Director himself reveals that poisons of the Novichok family can be produced anywhere. 

Next, more recently, this Deutsche Welle [article](https://www.dw.com/ru/minjust-frg-poluchil-zapros-rf-o-jurpomoshhi-po-delu-navalnogo/a-54759231) (in Russian) has the following passage - 

&gt;Schmidbauer \[former intelligence officer under Helmut Kohl\], in particular, touched upon the situation with the poison from the Novichok group of nerve agents. One of the Russian scientists in the early 1990s provided the German Federal Intelligence Service with samples of this type of poisonous substance. German intelligence provided samples for research in a Swedish laboratory, and the formula was later passed on to friendly intelligence services in secret, without informing Russia. ""Therefore, Novichok can be produced not only by the Russians,"" Bernd Schmidbauer recalled.

...which once again goes to show that this could be produced anywhere.

Finally, the English [wiki page for Novichok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent) has the following passage, and I quote -&gt;

&gt;**Novichok has, however, been known to most western secret services since the 1990s,**\[16\] and in 2016 Iranian chemists synthesised five Novichok agents for analysis and produced detailed mass spectral data which was added to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Central Analytical Database.\[17\]\[18\] Previously, there had been no detailed descriptions of their spectral properties in open scientific literature.\[17\]\[19\] A small amount of agent A-230 was also claimed to have been synthesised in the Czech Republic in 2017 for the purpose of obtaining analytical data to help defend against these novel toxic compounds.

In short, your assumption of ""uniquely Russian"" isn't accurate. Western agencies know of it since at least the 1990s. 

I will repeat - I'd love to have an actual discussion going, without name-calling.",Minsk (Belаrus'),/r/europe/comments/il76yy/bbc_news_navalny_poisoned_with_novichok_germany/g3r2ulb/,gib-upvote,1599072149

2051,"&gt; But then so were the  corresponding demands of the protesters. ""Grand National Assembly!"" they shouted. ""Change the constitution!"" 

Can you give me some source for that? And I don't mean some random soundbite without context.

&gt;And then they suggested some hardly relevant changes whose real purpose  seem to be to be just another thing to shout about and which I doubt  most people really  understood.

Like what ? What is ""hardly relevant"" but the opposition really wants to know about it?

&gt;Political illiteracy is off the charts

True that. But both is the apathy and unwillingness to check for yourself the truthfulness of any one statement.

&gt;It doesn't seem to me that splitting ВСС is just a small part of Ivanov's reforms

It's a soundbite. Easy to understand. But the spirit of the reform was much more than that.

Marx ideas were never feasible and only caused creation of plethora of derivative ideas that all have in common poverty and failure to reach their goals.

2151,"&gt; Yeah, that's a shit logic. If we follow it to its logical conclusion, Polish soldiers exectuted in Katyń were captured on the Soviet (Belarusian, Lithuanian, and Ukrainian) territory. First battle of Polish-Soviet war happened in Bereza Kartuzska
&gt; , at the site of a later concentration camp.
&gt; 
&gt; In Belarus.
&gt; YOU invaded Soviet Union first. The fact that you started losing for quite a while after that doesn't change the fact that the war itself was started due to Polish desire to be ""od morza do morza"" at the expense of Belarusian and Ukrainian lands.

Buddy. Soviet union IS NOT Belarus. IS NOT Lithuania. IS NOT Ukraine. Soviet Union CONQUERED these countries and was actively EXTERMINATING native resistance and SUBJUGATING the population with various means.

But do please continue. I am very entertained with your attempts at explaining why Soviets murdering people left and right was actually justified and fine. xD

Note. I don't think having soviet POWs dying in captivity was fine. If they were not killed in combat, after being captured they should have been tended to and released safely after the war.

To be honest, involving a war against Turkey is not a clever attempt. Especially nowadays... You need a good economy to do it. I am not saying that America doesn't have a good economy or French... But we are in tough times. It is a serious thing that they should consider. Turkey is not Iraq or Afghanistan. Americans worry too much about their economy nowadays like any other country. Unfortunately, the USA and the EU already are not that close after some economical issues. especially the USA had serious problems with France. Macron already talked about ""brain dead"" after their small economical conflicts with the US and talked about the EU should their own army.

I believe too many countries will avoid attacking Turkey in Europe too. Greece will be backed from France but I don't think they will be very active though. Since there are serious trade agreements between Turkey, France, and Germany. Germany will also avoid it because there are 2.5 or more? Turks living in their country. And unfortunately, most of them are Erdogan supporters.

2283,"For the people who are wondering, what happen in Bulgaria here some background information.

Is the ruling party corrupt - uhh... Yes. As any of the other parties from the last 30 years. After the collapse of communism all of the newly formed parties were created by people of the still exiting communistic background. So the newly formed constitution and laws to benefit them up to this day. 

So, why protesting now - Bulgarian had 30 years to protest. Because it's not about fixing the system it's about elections. In this September there are small local elections but they are a testing ground for the main parliament elections in March 2021. And before any major Bulgarian election there are protests to ""gather"" the voters. And it's better to have them in Summer than in Winter - you know more people. Also the future parliament will be in charge of distributing the EU Coronavirus subsidies. 

But why so many people in the current protests? You see, at the time when the newly formed constitution was created, the newly formed capitalistic economy was created by people ""trusted"" to the com-party with money from the party itself or stolen from the national budget. Usually, when a ruling party want some money they are shaking some of these old oligarchs with connections to the communist party because the Intelligence Service has everything about them. Like people say - Easy Money!

Unfortunately, the ruling party GERB ""stepped on snek"", earlier this year. They tried to shake Vasil Bozhkov a.k.a ""The Skull"". This MF-er is a Marvel Universe level, Kingpin type of villain. In internal correspondence of the US State Department he was described as ""the most infamous gangster in Bulgaria.""[wikipedia quote]. And his brutality equals his education – ""Applied Mathematics"" at Sofia University and ""Labor Economics"" at UNWE. Yep, this kind of super-villain exist in the real world.

So, It was no surprise that after he fled to Dubai to avoid prosecution charges of murder, money laundering, tax evasion and rape. We ended with a huge protests. He has enough money to topple the Queen of England.

OK. Cool, but why the escalation of violence in today's protests. Because of the leader of GERB - Boyko Borisov. He is from the same ""trusted"" guys as Vasil Bozhkov from 30 years ago. And after the quit of his firefighting career to start a security firm. He became bodyguard to two of the most corrupted figures in modern Bulgarian history - the ex-dictator Todor Zhivkov and ex-tsar Simeon II. So, he have learned some tricks from these two. See, when the protests started the leaders of the protests used the typical cliche of "" The political system is corrupt we want to take the power so to create a ""People's Assembly"" and change the constitution. Now, the ""People's Assembly"" is a type of National Assembly with the power, you guess it, to change the constitution. Not a single party wants that because it will change the established methods of corruption. You see, you only need your party to be elected into the National Assembly and this opens the option to ""benefit"" from the established roots. That's why this statement cliche works every single time. If there are normal elections the usual suspects will be elected and everything will go back to ""normal"". But if the elections are for ""People's Assembly"" - every politician loses his mind.

So, how Borisov answer this statement? Did he resign? Well... No. He said something like ""Ok, brah you have it. We are preparing for ""People's Assembly"". We can vote the green light earlier on 4 of September"". That's why we have escalation of violence in today's protests. That's why we have posts about this protests in this subreddit.

So the only question which remains is ""Is the ruling party violates the rights of the protestors?"" The answer is ""No"". Everything was peaceful with little or no provocations from both sides. Until today when the protesters start rioting against the cops. But the deadline for the Assembly is after 2 days so this was predictable.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/il34cc/antigovernment_protest_today_sofia_bulgaria/g3q2vd4/,micho_z,1599057961

In real life, Erdogan has repeatedly been giving the middle finger to the West including the United States and its real allies (Israel, Saudi Arabia) in the region both in words and actions repeatedly.  There's the way he exposed the Khashoggi murder and continuously rode it in the press to embarrass Saudi Arabia.  He constantly denounces Israel and his rhetoric has gotten even more militant in recent years.  He recently converted Hagia Sophia.  He imprisoned that American pastor.  None of these things happen in a vacuum.  But most importantly, he's been flirting with Putin.  He accepted the sale of the S-400 Missile Anti Aircraft system.  This got Turkey kicked out of the F-35 program with all deliveries canceled.  The US Congress despises him and wants payback.  Only Trump's corrupt relations with Putin (most likely) and Erdogan as well have saved him so far.  If Trump is voted out, Erdogan will be in even deeper shit as Biden has already spoke openly of replacing him outright.  The US will likely re-engage...and Biden will have full bipartisan support in Congress as everyone wants to make an example of Turkey for turning its back on NATO.

This is a long way of saying...Turkey is fucked.  Particularly if they strike out militarily.  The US and Western countries have already been screwing them financially for the past several years.  Erdogan is desperate to hold onto power.

SO MUCH THIS.

2342,"Sort of, the climate in the academic study of history was a bit different then, the US allowed people like Erich Von Manstein to write their recounting of the war, mainly as a way to study what tactics they used against the Soviets as pretty much everyone was expecting a new war against the USSR pretty soon.

The USSR didn't really share much intelligence with the allies about how the battles on the eastern front went and while the allies did have some observers they could really only relay what was happening on a strategic level (ie Russian troops retreating constantly eastwards).

So people like Manstein was allowed to sort of control the narrative in academic circles in the west, after all he was there so would know what happened right?

So his and his colleagues writings were taken as facts at face value due to one Wehrmacht General (can't remember his name right now) acting as an editor and sneakily aligning all the books with each other to present a consistent and coherent message which to a layperson or someone not really interested in history makes it look credible.

The most important part of the clean Wehrmacht myth presented in these books is making sure that every bad idea is blamed on Hitler or various other higher ups that were executed after Nuremberg thus making sure that noone with similar credibility as themselves could put this into question.

In the ""western"" academia Manstein and his cohorts has been into question since the 80s and thoroughly disproven after Russia declassified a lot of WW2 documentation after the fall of USSR.

Clean Wehrmacht is not something that any serious academic believes or promotes today, of course this doesn't stop this myth from continuing it's existence among armchair generals and wehraboos on the internet since they are by their nature impervious to any facts they do not agree with.",,/r/europe/comments/il4f8u/putin_calls_supporters_of_western_historians/g3pmqtd/,ikeashill,1599050675

Soviet Union 

shortly after the end of the war, more than one million ethnic Germans from Russia were in special settlements and labor camps in Siberia and Central Asia. It is estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 died of starvation, lack of shelter, over-work and disease during the 1940s.[5]

 
In the dying days of World War II and during the occupation of Germany, Soviet forces invaded German villages and raped German women en masse. It is believed by historian Antony Beevor that ""a 'high proportion' of at least 15 million women who lived in the Soviet zone or were expelled from Germany's eastern provinces were raped.""[6] Several thousand women committed suicide. On the final day of hostilities, 900 women in one village just east of Berlin took their children and drowned them in the river (followed by their own suicides) as soon as they heard the Russian guns coming. In all, only about 4,000 Soviet soldiers were ever punished for 

1944: The displacement of the majority ethnic Estonian population from the Estonian city of Narva by Soviet occupation authorities.

Yugoslavia 

1944 to 1945: The ethnic cleansing of Hungarians, or the massacres in Bačka by Titoist partisans during the winter of 1944–45; about 40,000 massacred.Afterwards, between 45–48, internment camps were set which led directly to the death of 70,000 more, of famine, frost, plagues, tortures and executions.
 

1943 to 1960: The Istrian-Dalmatian Exodus involved the diaspora of 350,000, mostly ethnic Italians together with anti-communist Slovene and Croat people, from Istria, Fiume and Dalmatian lands (mainly from the city of Zara), after the collapse of Italian fascist regime

November and December 1944: more than 200,000 Danube Swabians in Yugoslavia were expelled from their homes and interned in starvation and Nazi concentration camps for the old, young and disabled. Some 30,000 workers were expelled to Russia as slave laborers for war reparations.[

 


After the war 1944 to 1948: Flight and expulsion of Germans after World War II. Between 13.5 and 16.5 million German-speakers fled, were evacuated or later expelled from Central and Eastern Europe,[44][45] making this the largest single instance of ethnic cleansing in recorded history. Estimated number of those who died in the process is being debated by historians and estimated between 500,000 and 3,000,000.

It's also important to know, despite, as you said, the uprising expecting to be saved by the Soviets, they refused to coordinate/communicate with them, and well.. both sides refused to do so...

When you were talking about the Brittish and U.S, you made it sound as though they were desperate to send help, but the Soviets stoped them, I believe you will find the excerpt from this paper by Martin Stankiewicz interesting.

&gt;*Prime minister Mikolajczyk made this decision concrete by sending a telegram on July 26 to the delegate which
authorized him to ""announce the beginning of the uprising at the moment
chosen by you."" The Prime Minister, who was just getting ready to go to
Moscow to discuss with Stalin the matters of the border and the future shape
of Poland, wanted to have a strong argument - the military uprising for
independence - to reinforce his position.(22)
The following day, Ambassador to Great Britan Edward Raczynski paid a
visit to British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and informed him about the
plans for the uprising. He suggested that a brigade of paratroopers be sent to
Warsaw, that the German Royal Air Force around Warsaw be bombed, that
long-range fighter planes be given to the disposition of tile AK, and lastly
that it be announced that the AK holds combatant rights. Eden promised to
consider these ideas. Shortly after, Raczynski received a letter from Sir
Orme Sargent of the British Foreign Office stating that Britain lacked the
technical capabilities to assist Poland and ""therefore, there is nothing that
His Majesty's Government can do in this conexion....""(23) Meanwhile, a
Polish paratroops brigade stood by ready to go to Warsaw. Again England
refused to transport them because according to British Field Marshall Alan
F. Brooke, ""Large numbers of transport aircraft would be required for this
purpose, and these could not be spared at this critical stage of the campaign
in the west .""(24) While the Polish paratroops brigade refused to eat in
protest, no one troubled to inform General Bor, even after the rising began,
that assistance was not coming. It seems that vital information was withheld
often from the AK Not only was the Home Army already fighting on Soviet
land without knowing it, now they were about to engage in a full scale
uprising under the impression that aid was on its way. With the proper
information the AK command could have conformed their decisions
regarding the time and place of the uprising.
The fact that they did not receive combatant rights did not impede their
resistance efforts. Combatant rights would not have led to victory. But it did
mean that many insurgent lives were lost unnecessarily as a result. The
allies, when making the decision not to grant combatant rights, may have
thought that a combined and coordinated effort among the Poles and
Russians would have meant an easier victory. This was, in fact, what
England wanted - cooperation among the two. The mentality of the Polish
and Russian governments, and the fact that each had conflicting national
interests, did not allow for a close relationship.*",,/r/europe/comments/il16yc/on_september_1_1939_the_germans_invaded_poland/g3pbvsh/,YourLovelyMother,1599043652

The handover was pretty well negotiated. With wins in both sides and more particularly the prospect of autonomy (not independence) for HK for 50 years.

Instead they wanted more. More than the Chinese had guaranteed. Yanked the dog’s tail too hard and too Long and it bit back. What they have now is considerably worse than the extradition bill they originally( and successfully) opposed.

Regardless of your opinion, the idea that human life is treated as more valuable than property is legal *fact*.

I can think of any number of existances that would drive me to immediate suicide (but none of those apply to my present).

&gt; Regardless of your opinion, the idea that human life is treated as more valuable than property is legal fact.

In general, you are correct, and don't get me wrong, I agree. I also find it irrelevant to this discussion - the morality of damage against person and damage against property is the same, regardless if you deem a person more valuable then property. Now if you somehow have the choice between doing damage to property or injuring a person, *then* you should always choose to damage property over harming a person.

[Here is another article on the topic.](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/09/turkey-austria-spy-nehammer-kurdish-clashes-protests-vienna.html)

&gt;At the time, Austrian police said that extremist groups had confronted a peaceful Kurdish demonstration protesting Turkey’s attacks on Kurdish separatists in northern Iraq. Police issued fines to some of the Turkish counter-protesters who were allegedly using a banned hand gesture associated with an ultranationalist group in Turkey called the [Grey Wolves](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/08/turkey-erdogan-tries-to-expand-alliance-with-nationalists.html).

So basically the Kurds living in Austria were protesting at the silence of EU &amp; their Austrian government on what Turkey was doing in the Kurdistan region, the Turks sent their thugs to turn it violent similar to how they do it in Germany, but it backfired and they caught literally paid shills and agents of Turkish intelligence in the mix.",,/r/europe/comments/il0myi/austria_to_file_charges_against_turkish_spy/g3op15t/,Render216,1599023533

This situation is completely different.  Erdogan is now the existential threat.  He has no allies besides poorly armed Libyans and if he attacks Greece unprovoked Turkey is probably going to have to fight not only Greece, but France, Israel, Egypt, Italy and perhaps even the UAE and more EU countries.  Russia cannot intervene as helping the Turks versus an Orthodox Christian country with close cultural ties would be wildly unpopular domestically.

2816,"Well then I guess we have totally different views on the purpose of talking on reddit. Especially on serious matters like these, it would be actually useful to  debunk delusional arguments / opinions instead of either ignoring them, or not counter-arguing against them carefully.

The article you are talking about has not been denied indeed, but I wouldn't expect Erdogan to deny it even if it was false, it'd be conceived as ""weakness"" by his nationalistic base.

It shouldn't work like that for you with media. I'm not saying it didn't happen, we don't know that, I'm saying it's not trustworthy as the source itself is not known, and Die Welt is not the most reliable news outlet to begin with. Also, the fact that the media say X happened doesn't mean I have to prove it didn't, I just choose to doubt it when the story doesn't seem believable.

Moreover, there's a chance the Turkish government decided to ""leak"" this themselves to the German media, without it being a true story, but even if it is. If it didn't happen (if Erdogan never asked them to sink a boat I mean), they could have just leaked a fake story to scare the EU. If it did happen, it could be him wanting to communicate to his voters that he meant to actually sink a boat but the army refused. You don't know what's behind this. It could also just be a bad / misinformed source.

Many scenarios for this one really, the conclusion is it shouldn't be anybody's argument for why Erdogan is a dangerous bully. We have way better proof to present for this case.

I am not even going to talk about corruption as it seems everybody understands that. But why Serbs celebrate his fall the most is because 
Milo said that all Serbs in Montenegro are just confused Montenegrins and tried to suppress every Serb sentiment by revising history and even his, as he claimed he was a Serb about 20 years ago.

&gt; Serbian flags on the streets and chanting Chetnik songs while celebrating victory.

What's fascist about that? About flags u can look up what serb national flag , historical Montenegro flag and Serbia's flag looks like.

2951,"The thing is - I agree, and men should be allowed to be more vulnerable and to cry when they can't handle the pressures of life anymore. But the problem lies *not* in that man, or even men generally, but *society*. Society is the one that's supposed to change to accept and help out men when they are feeling vulnerable. From what I've noticed, many people (including *both* men and women) who claim they are fine with men crying and being vulnerable don't actually mean it - they might agree with in theory, but will then refuse to actually listen to those men and will perceive them as losers or not real men. 

There is a whole lot of other things that needs to change, too, not just the fact that men can't cry. The reason men can't cry is because there are such toxic expectations of them - they're expected to be strong, dominant, powerful, confident, outgoing, giving to society, and so on. In dating and relationships, they're expected to always make the first move, to be providers, to be protectors, to have a decent status, to have money, to meet certain unattainable physical qualities and so on.

The change has to happen in society, not in the men. When society stops treating men as if they're disposable and exist only as tools for the betterment of society (of everybody but themselves), that's when the lives of men will be better.",Serbia (Belgrade),/r/europe/comments/ikpsvk/uk_male_suicides_at_highest_rate_in_two_decades/g3nz342/,virbrevis,1599008145

3110,"And what exactly makes them evil compared to Erdoğanists and Gülenists? Doing what every nation in Europe did during the formation of their nation states is not inherently moral, it is neither evil nor good.

However what Erdoğan and the Gülent cult did is downright evil. They organized mass mobbing organizations in the military to force people to quit. They falsely accused and planted false evidence to imprison active duty soldiers and bureaucrats. They used the governmental institutions to strong-arm the ownership of media institutions. They forced businesses into bankruptcy. 

To this day you can not get a job in many lesser cities without being a member of AKP. A decade ago the requirement was to be a part of Gülen's cult.

If Kemalists had behaved the same way, there would not be an Erdoğan today. You might counter that Kemalists staged many coups (partially true, 60's coup was not backed by Kemalists for example and 80's coup was only backed by West aligned Kemalists), but at the end of the day Kemalism still opted for the plural democratic institutions that allowed AKP to exist in the first place.

In that sense the Swedish approach wasn't crazy at all: don't start too heavy and now people actually willing to do more than the government tells them to do, the number of infections still decreases and that lack of typical Spanish hysteria translates to a pretty straight line instead of major bumps.

3153,"I will speak a little from the heart now, but the truth is that there is no interest to speak the men's cause.

A propaganda effort in the last 10-15 years have lead to every movement for men being branded as misogynistic. MGTOW, red pill, Men's rights, etc. Many reddit boards were wiped out due to them being misogynistic. 

Shocker, a board of men confused by their role in society will talk about women. 

Every speaker that actually has managed to go through to men has been seen and treated as a David Irving of the gender debate. A person that denies the universal truth.

Jordan Paterson, whose only crime was to tell young men that they have the main role in their own lives and that they need to be responsible for it, was seen as a pariah, with people from all over media trying to nail him and drive him out of the debate fora like western snake doctor that needed to be chased out of town.  His anxiety made him collapse and he is now been out of the spotlight for a year or so.

So what does happen? Young men that do not belong in the top tier of society when it comes to attraction, skills, etc find themselves in a society that does not value them. They look for information elsewhere to find a reason, some order in the chaos and confusion they live in. 

They get depressed because they do not fit in, their identity and reason for being here is work, provide money so that your boss can get his third batch of kids with his third wife. They withdraw some protests or do not play the game by indulging in a hobby.

Why should they participate? Society only talks about the gender gap in the western world. How many more women need to be hired, how much they must earn, and how men are the cause of all bad things.

“All of a sudden, Charlie Hebdo got the reputation of being racist in the suburbs, where many Muslims live, but also among the left and the extreme left, based on the equation Muslim equals Arab. From the beginning, anti-racism was one of the foundations of the newspaper, which was created in the context of the Algerian war. Shortly before the attack, I talked to Charb about it and he said, 'What should I do? It is obvious that I am not a racist!

You guys really really like socializing in bars and cafés. We like it as well, but we are at a different level than you.

Sanitizer and hand washing, I am not even sure if that does not much, particularly in summer. And masks I think it is more and more clear they help a lot and they help a lot with creating assymptomatic cases, but it does not matter if you are all going to the same café or restaurant and are eating and talking without it! I mean even outside, if people are sitting and talking in each other's faces, whichever way the wind is blowing is pushing it all in the face of the downwind persons!

3372,"This doesn't really sound comparable to the [Hitler Youth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler_Youth) to me.

* The Hitler Youth became mandatory.

* The Hitler Youth was a Nazi Party organization.

* The Wikipedia article doesn't talk about it, but as I recall from past reading, the Hitler Youth displaced and incorporated a number of other youth organizations.  That is, it wasn't just an optional activity so much as *the* activity.  Well, maybe it does -- it says ""From 1933 until 1945, it was the sole official boy's youth organisation in Germany"".  Not sure what ""official"" means here.

None of these sound to be the case here.

Second, the pictures look to be from a single event at one such local organization -- I suspect that most of the kids involved did not spend the entire thing messing around with riot police or the military.

I can name a number of youth organizations having varying degrees of military and paramilitary characteristics that'd exist over here.  For example:

* In the US, [JROTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrotc), in high schools.  This is sort of a preparatory extracurricular activity for people who might want to be officers.  A [few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cycNolG6po) videos [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgCy628zI8s) some of [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfCLBbQ4c9A) activities.

* [Civil Air Patrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Air_Patrol), the civilian auxiliary of the US Air Force.

* The international [Scouting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouting) movement is less-explicitly-military, but it was originally derived by the Brits from military activity, and I think that it'd be reasonable to say that it's a patriotic organization.  I recall the oath pledging allegiance to God and country, at least over here.  It does teach riflery and wilderness survival, and it sounds to me a bit like what this Russian organization might be doing: ""In the far northern Yamal-Nenets region, kids have not only learnt ways to prevent accidents and cope in nature..."".",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ikhry0/kids_return_to_school_after_patriotic_summer/g3lz4rh/,duisThias,1598979182

3432,"Well my guess is that the franco-german MBT and 6th gen fighter programs might end up as usual, with both countries ending up doing things on their side, as usual.

The lack of German support to Greece and in general of the EU sovereignty + the unilateral closing of borders at the beginning of COVID will leave traces. That we don't have much to expect from Germany and that the EU is actually just a Zollverein 2.0, not a political entity which can do much more than standardizing the color of mailboxes across the continent.

In the case of a hot war in Europe against USSR, de Gaulle knew that what's happening now with NATO would be probable. NATO is made to protect the US, not the West and that the US would have fought to the last european.

The fear of betrayal is what defined the french foreign policy since the end of WW2. The British appeasement during the rise of Hitler (while France was willing to intervene early on, their refusal to join our alliance with the USSR), in May 1940 (when they decided to reembark the day after the German breached our lines in the Ardennes), Mers-el-Kebir and the Suez Canal expedition in 1956 left very deep marks on the french side. 

That's why de Gaulle decided that France should be self sufficient on every aspect of defense (nuclear, space and all the other usual capabilities which were only accessible to the US and USSR). The UK gave up a lot of capabilities in favor of US solutions available off the shelf.

We're enjoying the benefits of this self sufficiency these days, and there was I think a true desire to share it with Germany, especially through the common MBT and fighter programs. Even about offering our nuclear umbrella.

Depends on the test.

&gt;A CBC includes the following measurements:

&gt;Red Blood Cell Count (RBC) RBC's carry oxygen throughout the body.

&gt;Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) is the variation in size of the RBC's.

&gt;Hematocrit measures the percentage of blood made of up red blood cells.

&gt;Hemoglobin is a protein which carries oxygen in the blood.
Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) measures the average size of RBC's.

&gt;Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) measures the average amount of hemoglobin in a red blood cell.

&gt;Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) is the average percentage of hemoglobin in a red blood cell.

&gt;Platelet Count measures cell fragments which are vital for proper blood clotting.

&gt;Percentage and absolute differential count for types of WBC's including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.

Reaching the criteria isn’t optional since adopting the euro is an obligation. This is my position, and if other countries want, they can ask the ECJ for an opinion as well on the interpretation of EU law.

&gt; I dont get it with you pro-euro people in other countries than ours? Like sure you can adopt it in your countries I dont give a shit, its you who have to deal with it so but why do you think its okay to force it onto people in other countries that have literally voted against it?

I maintain the position that other countries are obliged to adopt the euro.

As I said - I maintain the position that the euro isn’t voluntary but mandatory.

3523,"A purely defensive military is a scary thing. 
Finland vs the USSR, Vietnam vs France, the US and then China.
Israel as you already mentioned.

It's not just equipment. it's docktrine. The best defense might be a good offense but making it clear to your enemy that, their singular goal in case of an invasion is to kill as many of your men, do as much damage to your cities and industry and scorch as much conquered earth as possible is a really decent deterrent.

Furthermore, you can focus on training soldiers in tactics that complement your primary goal, that you wouldn't necessarily want to overemphasize in a well rounded military. Fighting retreats and flexible defense, where you accept trading ground for enemy manpower. Teaching your soldiers how to cripple enemy soldiers without killing them so that they start becoming a political and economic burden at home (something that's pointless if you're goal is a quick victory on the battlefield) 

Defensive warfare has long been dismissed as ineffectual, as a means of postponing defeat and only really good for buying time, but especially when facing a conscript army, the amount of damage you can do to your enemy, while never leaving your borders or firing a single shot into their territory is incredible and must not be underestimated. 

The fundamental problem is of course, that a deterrent stops working as soon as the enemy thinks they're able to overcome your defense. This might be because they have someone really smart in charge who figured out a key weakness or because there's someone really dumb in charge who doesn't realize that they can't really win.

Given that every aggressive war ever lost was started by someone who thought they could win and given that even in victory, fighting a war on your territory is costly, sometimes even crippling I really hope Erdogan is just smart enough to keep it at sabre rattling.

The Hungarian Democratic Union (UDMR) is above the electoral threshold, with 5.7%.

Former president Traian Basescu's Popular Movement Party (PMP) remains below the 5% threshold that would allow it to enter the Parliament (4.1%).

ALDE went down even more in the polls, to only 2.4% of the voting intentions.

3663,"The way I see it There are essentially three power blocks in the Middle East 
1. Turkey Qatar and The GNA Tripoli government of Libya. These back Islamist groups like the Muslim brotherhood 
2. The Iran axis, Iran, Syria, the youth is in Yemen and more and more Iraq and Lebanon they back more pro Shia Islam groups like hezbollah 
3. The Status quo block Saudi Arabia, The UAE, Egypt, the LNA Tobruk based government in Libya. These don’t tend to be as political (given the rapprochement with Israel) but are feeling challenged by Turkey and Iran. 

Turkey wants to grow because it has a policy of vision 2023 stating that 100 years after the independence of their country post 1923 war everything will be wonderful it has an ambitious set of  economic targets and educational etc goals to meet. Unfortunately the Turkish economy was struggling for the last few years and it looks set the miss most of these targets by a fair margin. My theory is that by acting more expansionist they will either secure new advantages such as a very good agreement vis a vis Libyan oil should their side win, new concessions from other powers eg getting Greece to cede some of their EEZ this may generate the patriotism they (AKP) need to stay in power  or if they are beaten in Libya/Syria they can lay the failure to reach the vision 2023 goals at the feet of the foreign powers and corona and basically say we would have made it if it wasn’t for those meddling powers. 

1 and 2 don’t get in because Turkey is invading Idlib in Syria and is part of NATO a group Iran isn’t too fond of . Turkey dosent like that Kurdish groups it sees as terrorists find refuge in Syria Northern Iraq and western Iran. 

2 and 3 don’t get on for largely religious reasons Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi are the most influential nations representing each branch if Islam there is also a territorial dispute over the Arabian/Persian gulf. Plus Saudi is largely seen as a US stooge whereas the Iranians are heavily sanctioned by the US. 

1 and 3 don’t get on because Turkish influence erodes the power Base of 3 and because Turkish Interests threaten to destabilise countries in 3. This is why SIsi leader of Egypt has drawn a red line at Sirte basically saying if the Turks push beyond there they will intervene in Libya. They don’t want turkey turning Libya into another Syria on their doorstep. There are also historical differences as the Ottomans used to rule most of the region and many of the status quo powers are wary of Turkish necolonialist policies.

There is no evidence whatsoever of that. In fact, Stalin attempted to build an anti-Hitler front against Hitler until August 1939.

&gt;Regardless of what-ifs, Hitler and Stalin de facto started WW2 in Europe when they invaded from each direction. This is what fanaticism inevitably leads to.

3844,"&gt; Also it makes sense not to show the black sea EEZ, which nobody is fighting over 

The argument is that Turkey's EEZ is non-existent compared to Greece's. Showing the black sea illustrates they do have plenty of fishing and mining resources, it is just out of frame of most maps used. The implication being that they are cropped thus to strengthen the Turkish argument for more EEZ in the med.

A parallel would be a land dispute between Egypt and Israel that cropped off most of Egypt west of Suez to argue that Egypt needs more land vs Israel because they are so tiny. It's relevant where it frames the argument behind the dispute.

Fundamentally last few years were wake up call for many polish people  about relations with Israel and its people, people in Poland realized that views about each other werent mutual, polish people viewed people in the israel much more positivly then other way around which lead to people rethinking what they think about Israel now.

3860,"what you say about islam is mostly true, especially the part about muhammed but the link you gave is too nationalistic and doesnt serve any purpose other than propaganda

I have also been friends with several greek cypriots who were admitting the wrongdoings that their side did but they were afraid of speaking up in fear of social ostracization. this is how nationalism works, you paint you side as infallible and blame all the evil in the world on the other side and it ends up feeding hatred and nothing else.

&gt;Youre reasonable. But you’re a minority. And if you publish and say the things you say here openly or in the media you’re at risk of getting arrested by the Turkish government, as many reporters have before you.

I told you in my first post that I lost everything I had because I spoke up, I cannot step my foot in turkey anymore, I lost every penny that I have ever earned in my life and it happened for one reason:

I spoke up against injustice and human rights violations. 

I might be a minority but even if someone like me gets elected in turkey with a majority things would not change. Greece always had a maximalist approach (Apart from the tsipras era who constantly gets blamed in this sub for being a traitor and commie by the greeks which shows us the main problem here), and as long as turkey gets antagonized and bashed by nationalist no sane politician in turkey would be able to gather enough political capital to do a pullout. As I said the prime minister who ordered the invasion of cyprus was the only leftist prime minister in turkish history and he was famous for advocating peace and constantly criticizing US policy in the region. His hand was basically forced by the constant stream of news about ""atrocities happening on the island"". Again the turkish ""resistance"" on the island did a lot of shit in order to pull turkey in and they succeed in creating this mess which ultimately caused greater suffering and isolation for the turkish cypriot community.

As I said Erdogan was ready to pull out of the island and he was being blamed for being a western spy, traitor, CIA project, US collaborator yada yada by the nationalists in turkey. This was during the first talks about a referandum and before cyprus was accepted as a full member to the EU. Denktas rushed to the turkish parliament in ankara, did a stupidly emotional speech with tears in his eyes and literally begged the MP's to stop this process.

Turkey is not an islamic country, never was and never will be. Erdogan has been in power for 19 years now yet he failed at converting the country into an islamic one, turkish interpretation of islam is vastly different than other islamic countries since turks carried their unique shamanistic culture with them when they converted.

Secularism and laicite are different things, the state forced a harsh form of secularism on the population to keep islam in check and it backfired. IT was erdogan who was hailed as the great reformer by the EU,  his family filled several lawsuits against turkey in the european court of human rights  claiming their religious freedoms were being curtailed by the state. 

Now he is the opposite and trying to push an islamist ideology towards a population who is not interested in it and it has backfired. You could have cloned richard dawkins and made his clones preach across the anatolian mainland for 19 years and he wouldnt have been as successful as erdogan when it comes to turning people away from religion. 
 
When I was growing up in istanbul I was always the odd one for being a non-muslim among my friends, I was mocked, made fun of or felt like a stranger for being an unbeliever. Now almost every single turkish friend of mine have turned away from islam thanks to erdogan and his policies. Even the most devout ones are openly questioning the religion or moving into theism, to an outsider it is easy to see the big bad erdolf and a narrative about a warmongering turkish nation getting more islamic by the day but that is far from the truth.

The damage that erdogan did to islam in turkey will be visible for years to come just like the issue with german nationalism and adolf hitler. 

Turkey will not split or have a civil war, erdogan will be forced out in a few years than turkey will be busy trying to recover from the mismanagement of his era for the next 10 or 20 years. 

Ataturk was merciless that is also true but it was the truth of politics in his era, fascism was on the rise and he was trying to build a new secular state with a brand new identity so of course he resorted to nationalism and suppressed all minorities since that was the way to do it in that period. WW2 changed our perspective about nationalism, militarism and jingoism, humanity paid a hefty price yet still we are repeating the mistakes of the past. Turkey is still a WW1 era state with its foundation myth, militarism and treaties so it will take a while for her to catch up since it never experienced the horrors of ww2 but again erdogan is the next best thing for that totalitarian nightmare experience so I remain hopeful for the future.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/ijti2c/turkeys_president_erdogan_calls_leaders_of_france/g3k9cfd/,LadyLaurelin,1598942949

3870,"my audience for this response is smart, open minded people who are looking for real answers in this complicated matter. why not the rest you may ask? because look at this sub. anything said that even mildly defends turkey is downvoted to hell. i just saw a finnish guy at -34 for saying ""it may arguably be unfair to turkey"".

with this introduction out of the way, first of all, question everything. who is this user? how can he possibly know pixel by pixel what the greece's proposed map would look like? secondly, you can clearly see that he's trying to make this map look deceiving. how? look at the teal colored areas around greece and its islands vs the same colored areas around turkey's borders. VERY thin around turkish borders to make the red area seem bigger, thick around greece's borders to make the blue area look smaller. even then, look how unfair blue vs red colors are.

the response to this is, UNCLOS. because that's what their media keeps telling them. the fact is, unclos leaves the matter of islands to diplomacy. there's absolutely no agreement for island eez's. countries discuss and find solutions diplomatically. let's look at some examples, [this is what spain's eez would look like if they followed greece's understanding of unclos vs what it actully is](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EgyTkIyWAAAgm2F?format=jpg&amp;name=orig)

 [and here is england's eez with ireland](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EgyTkJNXsAA1y5D?format=jpg&amp;name=orig)

on another note, greece being the spoilt child hiding behind eu, have been acting just like one since turkish independence which started out with treaty of lausanne which states VERY CLEARLY that the islands in aegean can not be militarized. you guessed right. greece has militarized all of those islands since the 70s. European union did nothing about it. And you wonder why turkey doesn't work with european union? that's just ONE of your answers. turkey witnessed numerous cases of injustice from european union and lost trust in the union COMPLETELY. uneducated, arrogant, brainwashed keyboard warriors of greece, france, italy, germany, albania etc... you can circlejerk all you want. turkey will NOT let this happen. at the end of it all, greece would be embarrassed but they never feel embarrassed so...

almost forgot. also, [greece put up a garrison in meis yesterday](https://ahvalnews.com/kastellorizo/turkey-warns-greece-over-sending-troops-kastellorizo), an island just 2 km away from turkish southern shores. knowing all too well this is extreme provocation. europe knows this too. and thats why we keep saying, if shit hits the fan, europe will NOT support greece as much as they think they will. may be in terms of some hardware and a few hundred soldiers but that will be about it. so greece, don't be fooled. be smart.

3897,"You don't get it because you are convinced that Turkey is bad and Greece is good. First of all why would we attack you? We are already controlling East Med on the field. You don't get to stop our research ships. Because you have no legitimate reason to declare war on us. You see, Neither Greece, nor Turkey did NOT declared their EEZs on East Med officially. You have to officially declare it, then you need to send it to UN so they will recognize it. And maybe then you can say that there is a LEGAL violation. But Greek propaganda is so strong on you, you actually believe Turkey is doing something illegal. Neither Turkey, nor Greece are doing anything illegal. And also the map that shows Greek claims are not recognized by any legitimate authority. So on legal bases, you don't have the right to attack Turkey, and Turkey is controlling East Med. Why would we attack you?

And here is your second big mistake. You think EU is on your side. It's not. It is something Greece wants to turn into self prophecy. Italy has resigned from East Med Pipeline Project a year ago. Didn't you notice that they are being very silent? On the telecomission regarding sanctions against Turkey, Spain,Italy,Germany,Malta and Bulgaria voted no. Eu is not on your side. Because EU is not a legitimate authority to decide which side's claims are legitimate either. And it is not an EU member but you should also take it under consideration that Israel actually started a dispute with ROC regarding Aphrodit naturalgas well.I wonder why? Have you ever thought why? Because you have lost my friend. I wouldn't be surprized if Israel and Turkey were to sign a deal regarding their EEZ to be honest. And you think everyone would come to your aid if you call them to arms. They wouldn't.

&gt; we also don't talk about killing TERRORISTS. we just do. terrorists belong to worms. no need to talk about them. 

Nationalistic talk, very classy. I guess you may have missed my point as I was clearly referring to Turks accusing anyone and anything as being terrorists. It's actually Turkey's thing mimicked from the western buzzword ""terrorist"", but took it to new, unbelievable lows. [Lets not pretend Turks never arrested a singer, because she sang in Kurdish and accused her of being a terrorist.](https://www.jpost.com/opinion/kurdish-musician-in-turkey-sentenced-to-10-years-in-prison-for-singing-in-kurdish-402882)

&gt;look how dumb you sound.  

I don't sound dumb. You do.

&gt;does spain give up catalonia? how about germany bavaria? how about ireland? china? does america give land to mexico?

Go ask them? Who even wants Ireland to give up their lands? What are you even on?

Honestly each situation is different and trying to blur the situation with other issues doesn't make you right, it just makes you a egocentric nationalist. As if you get a chunk of the lands. You people are insane.

The facts are Kurds have long existed in their regions, long before the Turks even reached Anatolia. We Kurds speak Kurdish as our own language, have our own culture, own traditions, etc and here you are supporting basically majority Kurdish areas as being Turkish..

&gt;if kurds don't like living in turkey

Ok..

&gt;(they love it, that's why they're there)

Haha, made me chuckle.

Kurds desire their own nation and have done so for decades, since the drawing of the very borders we see today. This will not go away.

&gt;they are more than welcome to go to one of our southern neighbors.

Ironic, because Kurds in Syria are outside *your* borders and Turkey still invaded, citing security concerns, while in reality only invaded so Kurds in Syria do not take up autonomy increasing the desire for Kurds in Turkey to seek the same.

Secondly your politicians have even argued Kurdish independence is not acceptable anywhere on the planet, during the Kurdish independence referendum, again the obvious reason is it will spark the Kurds in Turkey to be motivated more to achieve it there too so really get your nationalistic story straight.

&gt;if a kurd takes up arms and go on the mountains to join pkk and get involved in guerilla warfare, they will eventually die a terrorist. very simple actually. 

You can call anyone you want a terrorist and believe it with all your heart, but it still would not make it true. In fact I was replying to a Turk claiming it's easy to talk tough, but war is horrible and the better path is through diplomacy. But like I said, only when you're the bully.

It will be tricky for Greece as Turkey has many easy smaller targets, but if Greece knocks out Turkey's offensive capabilities then moves onto taking out Turkey's defensive ones it will be over in a few weeks.

Turkey's 'active' and 'reserve' are in such high numbers because they've spent most of their time in state of civil war, pretending they're not in a state of civil war. I say civil war, but it's more like an occupation with the Kurdish parts of Turkey filled with check points and military zones. There is about 100,000 military personal alone active in the region Kurdish region.

The moment there is any war, the Kurdish region will liberate itself, the Turkish army will not be able to handle EU at the same time. All they need is for the military over there to lose a grip and be unable to resupply and provide any support.

Turkey is also heavily involved in Syria, the will lose the regions they occupy in Syria within a few weeks and I assume they'll abandon those positions too.

4128,"&gt;Sure, the Germany military is just on the same level when you completely disregard the state of its air force and navy.

Because you disregard the army and throw things around that are partially even true. 


&gt;The RAF's strategic capabilities are unmatched by any other European country when it comes to reconnaissance, mid-air refueling, heavy transport and drones.

The RAF has in reconnaissance a slight edge, but not much compare to France. Even that much more than Germany.

&gt;mid-air refueling

Not really. France has more and pretty much tied with Germany, the German A400m are also capable of Refueling.


&gt;heavy transport

So unprecise that I will just use to my advantage, outside it's C-17 the UK doesn't really stand out. It's like with the refueling. France has more and Germany especially due it's large order on A400M with plenty already delivered. 

&gt;drones

Tied with France, but ahead of Germany.


&gt;It also operates the biggest fourth and fifth generation fighter aircraft fleet in Europe.

If you exclude Russia, Germany and France that would be true.
And even if the UK has all it's F-35 delivered, that number be far lower than Germany. And Germany itself wants to increase their numbers. 


&gt;d let's not even get started on combat helicopters where the Apache of the British is head and shoulders above anything Germany has. Hell their Tiger doesn't even have a canon...

The Apache is a good Combat Helicopter, but Tiger is as good. Yes the missing frontal Pod is arguably bad. But also numerical UK has as many as France and not much more than Germany. 


&gt;Navy wise, while Germany is not able to deploy a submarine at this time, the UK could deploy 10 nuclear submarines of which 4 are strategic. 

You don't know how navy deployment work. 1/3 in dock, 1/3 training and 1/3 deployed. And the Submarine issue was bad, but more a unlucky coincedent, like that the USA had all it's 6 Eastcost Carrier in dock at the same time. Nobody would say US Navy is therefore bad. 

&gt; The UK also just launched its second state-of-the-art aircraft carrier that is already (or will be in future for the second carrier) equipped with fifth generation fighters.

Yes the UK navy is great and invested vastly in it. 


&gt;Those carriers are protected by the probably most powerful destroyers out there while the Germany navy bought the fraud that is called F 125

The F 125 are not great, but they are what they are bought for. 


&gt;And lets not even get started on Fleet Auxiliary...
Mostly their supply ships are bigger, which makes sense. 

Also Germany is making major investment into it's Navy. We have the F-125, MKS 180, 5 new Corvettes, 2 more submarines, replacing of all minewarfare ships, and many additional Auxialliry ships.


&gt;Yeah, if you completely disregard all those facts and think some new IFV for the Bundeswehr are going to cut it on the modern battlefield you are right, Germany is on par with the UK...

You mean atleast Germany has modern army equipment compared to the UK and even in numbers.

Nonsense. Babiš is both politically and economically quite far away from Duda, Orban and Borisov.

There is no reason why Czechia should adopt Euro just because Slovakia did.

The reason Czechia does not adopt Euro is that it would be economical suicide. Currently, Czechia is a huge export economy, mostly to Germany. Having own currency enables to react on the outside economical situation. This is one of the reasons why the recesion did not affect Czechia that much and why currently, Czech economy is quite in a good shape with record low unemployment.

4194,"Politics aside, can we all agree this originated as a result of the natural gas findings in the east med territorial dispute? So, in terms of self interest, the cost benefit actually reinforces the risk of war versus keeping Turkey completely out of the natural gas pipeline project? Turkey has a massive market for natural gas that Israel/Egypt can sell to, but they're entirely bypassing Turkey because of political reasons. They could build the pipeline at a lower investment by going through Turkey, but EU/Arab leadership do not want Turkey to diversify energy resources. Turkey has been attempting to diversify energy imports to gain leverage on gas pricing for two decades. Gas is the Achilles heel of Turkey. It's the leading contributor to it's trade deficits and compounding effect on lira depreciation. i.e. print more lira as lira gets weaker to buy a constant volume of gas. 

The risk of war is real because for a small controlled conflict, the rewards are great. This is no joke. The public debt to GDP ratios of Spain, Italy, Greece, France are all at &gt; 100% GDP. This will be a damning situation. People are underestimating the risk of war here because the domino effect is dangerous. This is primarily the calculus Russia has when it gets cornered politically.

Youre reasonable. But you’re a minority. And if you publish and say the things you say here openly or in the media you’re at risk of getting arrested by the Turkish government, as many reporters have before you. 

Most Turks don’t really share your views. 

There are many Turkish Cypriots who have said similar things.. and many who were arrested. 

I still have faith cyprus can work with Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots. But it’s becoming more and more impossible as more mainland Turks are pushed into cyprus with more extremist proturkish nationalist views. 

Unfortunately Islam is powerful and there isn’t much people can do against it once it’s griped a country. 44 majority Islamic countries none with freedoms democracy and all the things we expect in western countries. This is also why people now fear a Cypriot solution on the Greek side.. as the populations are more equal now.. and the north flooded with non Turkish Cypriots aka mainland Turks. Turkish Cypriots were traditionally the most secular muslims you could find anywhere in the world. 

Greek Cypriots are also afraid to end up like Lebanon. 

Honestly at this point - my best hope for turkey at this point and it’s trajectory is to either split itself into 3 countries or become like Saudi Arabia that gets along with its neighbors and holds its Islamic principles, but doesn’t fight with the west. 

I’ve just never seen a majority Islamic country ever become secular. Secularism always loses to Islam. Only hyper nationalism under attaturk managed for a brief period to calm Islamic fundamentalism.. but come on - he was also merciless.

Attaturk came closest. I wish Zoroastrianism was still alive, if I was frank. 

I just feel the prophet Mohammed is like worshiping Alexander the Great. You’re not going to compromise on expansionism and the ideals it has.. Turkishness is the same expansionist ideology as it is composed of many different tribes and keeps wanting to expand. I’m actually amazed Saudi Arabia has managed to play by the west rules. I think it has to do with the monarchy. (Even in it’s own vileness - it’s managed to be happy within its borders). Although as a natural classical liberal - I wish more freedom to the people within that country too.

Jesus as the moral template - is a lot more passive. And I believe these stories define the culture.

4216,"Some have already answered but I'll try to be more thorough.

You make a few mistakes in your reasoning as the answer is not as clear cut as ""EMALS consumes more energy"". Let's start by the basics, to take off, a plane needs to achieve a minimum speed dictated by its airframe and mass. This means that it needs to be accelerated over a certain distance to do so. The energy transferred to the plane would be m·a·x with m, the mass, a, the acceleration and x, the distance. To that energy, you need to add losses, mostly in friction which depend on the drag function of the airframe as well (among other things).

Based from that, we can say that launching aircraft from the CdG's replacement will require more energy no matter what because one of these aircraft will likely be the NGF which is expected to be much heavier than the Rafale (with a MTOW in the 35000kg range). Assuming the same liftoff speed at MTOW, the added mass will increase the required energy (probably around 40%) while the bigger aircraft will likely increase friction.

Now lets investigate the launch method. The conventional steam catapult uses steam heated directly by the reactor then carried all the way to the piston before release.

On the other hand, an EMALS uses electricity generated by the reactor's turbine, carried to the alternators and then released.

The error here is that you assume a worse efficiency of the EMALS. However, that is simply not the case. Thermodynamic processes in general have terrible energy efficiencies, due among other things to heat losses (keep in mind the stored or carried steam will continuously lose heat). The efficiency of a steam catapult is a mere 5% (i.e. it will require 20 time the energy required to move the aircraft).

Electromechanical systems however have extremely high efficiencies (especially at high power). In this case, the EMALS is estimated at 90% efficiency. This means that an electromagnetic system will need 1/18 of the energy required by a steam catapult to launch the same aircraft.

This however raises the question of electricity production and the efficiency of that particular process but it should still be better than the steam catapult.

Additionally, a steam catapult is much heavier and maintenance intensive (no moving parts in an electromagnetic system) and it requires the use of fresh water meaning higher stress on the energy consuming desalination systems.","Belgium, Benelux, EU",/r/europe/comments/ijga0b/fs_charles_de_gaulle_and_uss_dwight_d_eisenhower/g3ixqyi/,loicvanderwiel,1598913937

4221,"You asked why Erdoğan, an Islamist politician, keeps being voted in despite a low amount of religiosity in Turkey. Excellent question, let me try to answer it in the best way I can.

Erdoğan fares on the votes of the older, particularly male, non-college educated electorate. These people have experienced the political turmoil between the 60s and 80s, and due to the economic boom Erdoğan created in the 2000s, they associate him and his party with economic stability.

Due to this association and keeping in mind what they witnessed in the past, they are far less reluctant to trade in modern ideas such as secularism and social freedoms for prosperity and security. The younger generation is quite tech-savvy, born in the 90s, acquire a lot of information on the way of life in Europe and really want one thing: to live like that guy in France or that girl in The Netherlands and not worry about what his money will or can buy him to feed him or her tonight.

It is really a minority actually voting for Erdoğan. Most are just in for the economic boom they hope he'll generate again, some are in for him as a leader. Besides, his party is currently in an alliance with the nationalists, whose electorate doesn't necessarily support him as well. But it is party politics, what can we expect?

A huge effect is that due to Erdoğan pushing religiosity in Turkey, more and more younger people are actually drifting away from it, as I tried to show by providing you that source. So his rule actually affects the current and future religious-political landscape as there is an increasing amount of people not falling for the religious card in Turkey. 28,5% sounds like a minority, but it has been some time since this study was conducted, we can assume a sizeable amount of those asked lied because of stigma/fear and these people have friends who they discuss these things with, possibly having a ripple effect.

Elections in Serbia in June were PROVEN lawfully that they were rigged. The court rendered a judgment and? Nothing. Like nothing happened. The EU and the US said:""We are happy that Vucic won fair and square"".

Fun fact: There is no opposition party in the parliament. None. Not even a SINGLE one.

The judgement will go in  Strasbourg now. Hopefully we can maybe get it in our way. But it is very much hypocritical from EU to say that Vucic's elections were fair and square, while Lukashenko's are not.

The EU and the US have their own interest. Which is fine. But it's not that they are pro democrats. They are pro money. Which is okay, but that doesn't mean just because Milo said on paper that he was pro EU, that instantly makes him a democrat. He didn't do SHIT while on the way to the EU. He didn't fulfill none of the headings. None.

**EDIT:** Since 1987 Turkey is trying to force its way into Europe. 33 years. Croatia applied for EU membership in 2003 and became a member in 2013. 

According to you, Europeans want Turkey in the EU, so what magic is going on here? I don't want Turkey in the EU. It's time to end this nonsense and tell Turkey the same thing we told Morocco.

&gt;In 1987, Morocco applied to join the European Communities (the precursor to the European Union). The application was rejected on the grounds that Morocco was not considered to be a ""European country"" and hence could not join.

4311,"&gt; If you analyse how this win was received in Belgrade and among pro Serbian supporters you will see that results of this elections are received as win for Serbia and Serbian nationalists which you have plenty there. People flooding streets, flying Serbian flags and carrying Serbian’s church insignias to celebrate Montenegro decision to get rid of dictator?!? Heck, go here on subreddit Serbia and see how they react and how most of them with passion downvote anyone who points these facts.  

It is sort of understandable, they have seen their family and friedns protest in Montenegro for the las few months. Many have relatives, families and friends here and they seriously care about how their fight against an autocrat is going.  


Reddit Serbia has a bit of a different agenda imo. They have seen the fall of a dictator in a neighbouring state and hope this will translate into the downfall of Vucic, a domino effect if you will. Whiel there are certainly nationalists in Serbia celebrating tonight, I think most however ae just happy to see Milo gone.  


&gt; There are a lot of People there who were passionate opposition to government and Dukanovic’s rule but proud citizens of Montenegro in favour of close relations with Serbia but not willing to be consumed as another Serbian province. 

I think a vast majority of people dislike the idea of a union with Serbia. Even the nationalist Serbs here don't want Vucic and his crazy government nor do they really want to join Serbia. They mostly look for better relations iwth Serbia after their coooling i nthe last few months.  


&gt; How Serbian Party in Montenegro will handle this issue is crucial for stability of this country. They MUST keep isolating their extremists and keep their own line without “input” from Belgrade. If they do that and keep their promises and support expert government all is good.

4343,"Well its just a fact and he is a common autocrat like the others around the world. Same behavior, same delusions of building a great empire. He has his own truth and will arrest everyone who becomes annoying to him. Of course he invades other countries, kills kurds for being kurds. Fights the christian minority. If I take out a history book of europe and scroll back a few decades I can see a very similar shame.

Dont get me wrong. I am totally fine if you elected him. Its your leader, your country and maybe your choice. I am also fine if he won and the majority of turkish people is fine with it. If you stand behind him go for it. Share his delusions but don’t be upset if you wont find much compliments for shouting these out to the countries he is annoying since years. 

Also we do have our sight on things and of course we will not advocate leaders that are not reliable, trustful and arresting our journalists and citizens for just being uncomfortable.

Of course I am also not fine with the european union in all cases. But I will not be arrested if I say anything against my government. Your so called european ‚weakness’ is just free speech and freedom for us. 

Maybe it looks like we cannot fight to you. In Europe we try to solve the most things by words or on an economic level. Fighting is always the very last choice. Thats how we handle things here. If you think strength is measured in tanks, rockets and soldiers remember from whom you‘re buying your equipment.

Nevertheless all my words are not against the turkish citizens. I guess in the end you’re the same lovely people as we are and turkey is of course a nice country to visit. Lets have a tea and a good time here on reddit. Without all this war crying bullshit.

Armenians? Well this is a little bit complicated. Please imagine this: You are a very poor country who couldn’t even feed her own people. You are at war with half of the world with allies with good guns but even your rich ally has problems with food. Your own soldiers eat grasshoppers in front since you can only send a little piece of bread and little amount of compote per day. Grasshoppers are abundant and very nutritious, so your head of religion gives a fatwa that says eating grasshoppers is not a sin. Then you have traitors in East, who cooperates with your enemy and kills their own neighbors. You can’t exterminate them, it would be both against your culture (yes, despite your perception of it, Turkish culture is very good in terms of humanity) and would be very costly for you, exterminating your people haven’t been a good thing in any era of human history. So you did what you only can do, isolate them from the hot front. It is a very harsh path with many deserts and threats but it was your only option, otherwise Russians would come into your heart, which would make the war over for you. You departed them with as much as safety you could afford but it wasn’t enough, so they were dead. Where is the genocide in this context? I just see the usual war, suffering of innocent people, not any other thing.

Jews? They were an integral part of the empire for hundreds of years and late imperial and the whole republican era are not exceptions. The Jews that want their own country tried to make that happen and the ones that are fine with their country stayed with us. Today a significant amount of trade of Turkey is in hands of Jews.

About Aegean would it make sense that Aegean Greek islands are surrounded by Turkish waters? Just because Turkey doesn't accept that islands have EEZ doesn't make it true.

About Kastellorizo, there I see the point since it's a small island near the Turkish coast that keeps the turkish EEZ near the coast. I can see why that's a problem for Turkey and I believe that this is a place that Greece would be willing to negotiate on.

About Cyprus, Cyprus is an island state. The third biggest island in the Mediterranean. Everyone in the region accepts that Cyprus has EEZ. All neighboring countries of Cyprus except Turkey and Syria(for obvious reasons since there is war and political instability) have made EEZ agreements with Cyprus. Egypt, Lebanon and Israel all made an EEZ deal based on the median line as International law suggests.
Turkey drills south of Cyprus. Is that a part of ""Blue Homeland""? Nobody cares, all countries expressed their support to Cyprus (countries of the Eastern Mediterranean, EU, USA, Russia, China, everyone).

For starters, Turkey is technically occupying a part of an EU country and has created a puppet state that no country in the world recognizes, except Turkey itself.

The EU offers membership and peace to countries that are willing to take it, Turkey clearly isn't.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia#Attitudes_towards_the_campaign

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_unrest_in_Kosovo

There were instances when bombs 'missed' their targets by 10 kilometers and fell into a city market (Nish, Serbia's 3rd biggest). Also a passanger train was targeted as it was crossing a bridge. All passangers died, and the recording was sped up 4 times so that it shows how pilot had no time to abort. There is a footage of this on YouTube. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grdelica_train_bombing


They bombed the Tobacco industry of Nish, British-American Tobacco's main competition for the region. Once they flattened it, they bought it after the war for change. Same thing with Zastava car factory. FIAT bought it. There is also an instance when a cluster bomb shrapnel in the center of Belgrade killed a 5 year old girl through the window. That really pissed the people off.

What has the Soviet-Union to do with the Greco-Turkish war to do?

To quote from your wikipedia link:

&gt;As the supply situation worsened for the Greeks, things improved for the Turks.[citation needed] After the Armistice of Mudros, the Allies had dissolved the Ottoman army, confiscated all Ottoman weapons and ammunition,[88] hence the Turkish National Movement which was in the progress of establishing a new army, was in desperate need of weapons. In addition to the weapons not yet confiscated by the Allies,[89] they enjoyed Soviet support from abroad, in return for giving Batum to the Soviet Union. The Soviets also provided monetary aid to the Turkish National Movement, not to the extent that they promised but almost in sufficient amount to make up the large deficiencies in the promised supply of arms.[1] One of the main reasons for Soviet support was that Allied forces were fighting on Russian soil against the Bolshevik regime, therefore the Turkish opposition was much favored by Moscow.[1] The Italians were embittered from their loss of the Smyrna mandate to the Greeks, and they used their base in Antalya to arm and train Turkish troops to assist the Kemalists against the Greeks.

 Presumably under a planned economy salaries and benefits would be calibrated so that the job positions that are harder to fill (unpleasant, dangerous, time-consuming, difficult schedules, etc.) get filled, when intangible rewards like honor, respect, prestige, or being just plain interesting and captivating, aren't enough. 

So, for example, in a society where everyone can have access to free education with no opportunity cost, I'd assume doctors, lawyers, and scientists would get paid less than sewer maintenance technicians or high seas fishermen or miners, to name a few.

Ramping up the current production to match losses in a war is hard to pull off, you'll need way more qualified workers than Dassault and Airbus currently have and could train, and the production process is a mess with many sites across France (for Dassault) and the Typhoon is being built in 4 different sites (as every country wants its piece of industrial cake). You can't compare the production lines for automobile and aeronautics. In Europe the most advanced line production is for the A320 (aim is 67 A/C a month in 2023), way below what every car manufacturer can do.",France,/r/europe/comments/ijti2c/turkeys_president_erdogan_calls_leaders_of_france/g3gzigj/,NobleDreamer,1598884909

There's an issue though. Divide and conquer is a thing because ""us vs them"" is deeply ingrained in our nature, which is lagging behind progressive culture.

In case of Russians(Rossiyane?) this is tremendously multiplied by ""rise at the expense of others"" logic, by warmongering imperial nationalism running through centuries of Russian history, by  love for the ""strong hand"" (and any display of power really), by decades of propaganda and, in my personal opinion, by total lack of empathy among older folks. Oh, and don't get me started on Moscow, people from Moscow are on completely separate level of human trash (don't take my word for it - go ask some Russians from literally any other region).

Their culture, their worldview, their attitude towards other humans beings is poison, and they gladly embrace it. What's worse, younger people soak this shit up and adopt behavior models of homo sovecticus, which is really depressing.

Now, I am not saying every single Russian is like this - far from it. There's this dual nature to Russians - one described above, which makes up majority and dictates country's policy, and another, a counter-part which doesn't lack empathy and clearly sees through the bullshit. I pity them; smart and passionate people throughout Russian history have fought against the ugly core that makes up Russia, and lost. And kept losing. Generations and generations of the brightest writers, musicians, scientists, medics, have either surrendered, ran away or lived their lives being enemy in the eye of their own people (or government for those more lucky).

...

This turned out to be a lengthy rant. Culture, language and history are just as much of a genetic code to a nation as genes to a human. Russian genetic code does not put human life, dignity and liberty - what the EU in theory is built upon - anywhere near top of it's priorities.

Naiveté.

&gt;This is the issue. If Turkey wants some of these waters, I already gave you the answer - ratify UNCLOS and sue Greece. Turkey will definitely win a lot of EEZ this way. But it won't win all the EEZ it currently claims.

What are the guarantees if Turkey does recognize Greece's EEZ claims and sue them the court won't be heavily biased against Turkey? There will be no going back after that you know? If we recognize it that's it, we will be isolated from the Mediterranean despite having the longest coastline, and the natural gas reserves.

&gt;Well, my advice is to change your national attitude fast

Turkey is a big country that needs to feed its people and make its voice heard. It's not about attitude, it's about prioritising our own interests. I know europeans still seem to think that we are a backwater pisspoor weak buffer state but that's not the case.

 Previously you made a comparison with Romania and Bulgaria, well we're not in the same calibre. If Romania or Bulgaria don't like their situations they do what?

4846,"&gt;Bangladesh's proposal did not use St. Martin's island for any basis point when calculating equidistance. If it had done so the median line would roughly be drawn straight to the south-southwest. I did not see any such document submitted to the court.

not really, you can imagine islands as part of mainland. when two seperate countries has common mainland border at the sea, the line is straight. which is almost the case for islands too, if you adjuct the distance difference.

\&gt;[Here](https://amti.csis.org/the-bangladeshmyanmar-maritime-dispute-lessons-for-peaceful-resolution/#:~:text=Under%20a%20standard%20application%20of,the%20length%20of%20its%20coastline.) is a pretty good layman's overview. Point is that your quote was from the beginning of the line-drawing process and the principle was only used to set a baseline to work off of, *after ignoring the island*. The line was then modified to the benefit of Bangladesh. Bangladesh's position was of being disadvantaged by geography, Myanmar was arguing for strict equidistance so the analogical association would be Bangladesh-Turkey and Myanmar-Greece in your chosen example.

which is where greece and turkey are trying to go, right?

\&gt;By the way, the court did not award Bangladesh its proposed line. It basically went straight down the middle of the two proposals, although obviously this was not how it's described in the court decision.

the tribunal did not 'ward'anything to anyone, it just agreed with everything bangladesh said besides its proposed line which rudecued by 50%. meaning it got every single other right, like 12nmi. does that ring a bell?",,/r/europe/comments/ij02rp/genuinely_trying_to_understand_the_current/g3gbii7/,cupid91,1598870697

4877,"&gt; A dictatorship simply conceding power after a general election without blood shed is highly unusual. 

I agree so far this is quite unusual, although you should keep in mind they still hold the Presidency as of this moment.  


&gt;  Also the formerly ruling party has opened Montenegro to the EU and NATO, not something that dictatorships usually strive or succeed in.   
&gt;  
&gt;Now this is quite interesting. The thing about the path to the EU is, it was infinite. Joining the EU is very popular here and load of people support it, so it si a great campaign boost if you are pushing for joining the EU. DPS capitalised on this by constantly making small progress towards the EU, however with the intention to never join, because it would be impposible with the DPS in power as they could never fulfil the corruption and juristiction chapters to join. So for DPS, it was more about the journey than rather about joining.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The opposition in this case on the other hand appears to be a nationalist, pro-serbian and pro-russian movement. We'll see how much more democratic they turn out to be if they should be able to form a government. 

  I see this quite often in this thread but it's not true. The Pro Serbian party will back a expert government made by URA which is Pro-EU, Pro NATO political party as they are the deciders of the majority. So we shall be almost certainly staying on the curent course and this will probably even speed up our Pro Western drift due to Demokrate and URA who are 2 of the 3 parties needed for majority which are both Pro EU and Pro NATO.

Concerning Russia funding nationalist parties across Europe, you have to prove these accusations and also explain why a socially conservative party that supports centre-left economics should have anything against other parties it shares at least one of the mentioned positions.
I am yet to see an argument of why you consider supporting an independent cadidate something which is exclusive to Russia (Mind you, even if it was, and it isn't, that would still prove nothing). 
Lifting sanctions on Russia first would result in increased economic activity between Bulgaria and get us back to normal relations.

5069,"&gt;Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire

This again. The Holy Roman Empire adhered to certain Roman traditions and titles, its Emperor blessed by Pontifex Maximus. It controlled Rome too for the first few generations. 

  
Holy can be considered a subjective term, a opinion. What is holy for you is blasphemy for your neighbour. Its useless. 

And not a Empire? It had a Emperor and the most subjects during most of Europes history since its foundation. 

People use that quote so often its annoying. 

Voltaire was a 18th century Frenchman. Beside the fact that the French were always bothered by the fact that the Emperor protected its princes from the ever lasting French expansion into German/Dutch/Italian lands, it was also a quote that very specifically applied to that century. Voltaire claimed it wasnt a Empire because Imperial authority had been crumbling for a while by the time Voltaire came about. He claimed it wasnt holy because it allowed protestant and reformed princes. He claimed it wasnt Roman because the Emperors werent of Roman descent.

5098,"If you disagree with me, at least let me get my point across. If we assess the leaders of BSP, we see that:

The first one who led the party for more than a year is Jean Videnov (1991 - 1996). His government was unsuccessful, but it definitely wasn't depensent on Russia - it refused to sign a deal with Gazprom (The Ivan Kostov government signed a very unbeneficial one two years later).                           Next leader being Georgi Pûrvanov (1996-2001). You see, it never mattered or was that visible if he is or isn't influenced by Russia, because at the time BSP couldn't get in any government.                                                                                   After him, Sergey Stanishev became the party leader (2005-2013). It is beyond stupid to call him a Russian puppet, unless you consider the ones that elected him president of the Party of European Socialists Russian puppets as well.
Then Mikhail Mikov, who was a puppet of Stanishev, took power for two years. I believe Mikov supporting you is more of a negative and that no one would want him as an ally anyway.                                                                                                Since 2015 (or was it 2016?) Kornelia Ninova has been the leader of BSP. On the presidential elections, the party supported a candidate who was educated in USA and led the airforce of a NATO country (Bulgaria, obviously). Ninova has some quotes that are indeed weird, but it was likely only for the fact that the BSP voting pool includes many people nostalgic for Zhivkov.                                                                        I'd love to hear your arguments and ecourage you share them.

Concerning ""Why are you allowed to vote"" part, it is pretty simple. That's because I am over 18 years old, live in Bulgaria and have never been in jail. If you feel disappointed knowing I'm allowed to vote, feel free to go live in China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia or any other countries where people like me are not allowed to express their opinion on elections.

5104,"&gt; 10 months after the EU referendum, the ‘ING Economic Network’ carried out a survey asking people about what the economic consequences would be as a result of the UK leaving the European Union. 45% of the respondents didn’t know any of the consequences at all. 

I mean, the Vote Remain campaign didn't really seek to expand greatly on them, as I recall, just argued that it was economically-advantageous to remain.

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515068/why-the-government-believes-that-voting-to-remain-in-the-european-union-is-the-best-decision-for-the-uk.pdf

&gt; The EU is by far the UK’s biggest trading partner. EU countries buy 44% of everything we sell abroad, from cars to insurance. Remaining inside the EU guarantees our full access to its Single Market. By contrast, leaving creates uncertainty and risk.  The EU’s Single Market has over 500 million customers and an economy over five times bigger than the UK’s. The Single Market makes it easier and cheaper for UK companies to sell their products outside the UK, creating jobs as a result.  Being inside the EU also makes it more attractive for companies to invest in the UK, meaning more jobs. Over the last decade, foreign companies have invested £540 billion in the UK, equivalent to £148 million every day.

I mean, there are some *numbers* there, but in all honestly, it's pretty fluffy.  Like, it says that foreign companies have invested a certain amount of money into the UK.  However, I am very confident that there is a significant chunk of the population that doesn't think that foreign investment is a good idea at all.

There does seem to be general concern among publics about the number of available jobs and the risk of running out of them, and the text makes much of the idea of being in the EU resulting in ""more jobs"" -- but an economist isn't likely to use that phrasing -- they're using political language, not economic.

People feel that export markets are important, but often seem concerned about the prospect of imports -- that is, the idea that imports are bad and exports are good seems to be pretty widespread.  You note that the above text talks about the potential for exports and refrains from saying anything about the potential for imports.  In fact, on /r/ukpolitics, I saw a number of people saying that EU membership was bad because the UK tended to import more than it exported from other EU members.

A lot of people are worried about the effects of free trade agreements.  The idea of lowered trade barriers isn't seen as a plus, but a minus.

I mean, I think that the basic problem is that you aren't going to be able to do a great idea of, in the few paragraphs that you *might* get people to read, providing people with the knowledge necessary to make useful sense of what hard facts they can provide.  The best you're realistically going to do amounts to asking people to trust the domain experts and say what their position is...and the British government did do that:

&gt;The Government believes it is in the best interests of the UK to remain in the EU. This is the way to protect jobs, provide security, and strengthen the UK’s economy for every family in this country – a clear path into the future, in contrast to the uncertainty of leaving.
&gt;
&gt; ☑ A stronger economy

While I, too, complained about the accuracy and quality of the public discussion on the economic impact, over time, I've come to increasingly believe that this was simply a political necessity.  You aren't going to have 67 million people sitting down and arguing the fine points of the impact on trade policy or the like.  *Nor should you*.  The reason we have specialized labor is so that everyone doesn't have to learn to do everything.  The only thing I can think of is maybe the government providing some pre-chewed estimates of economic impact on individuals, and honestly, my guess is that they considered it and discarded that as being less-politically-effective.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ijlzeg/what_is_the_current_situation_with_brexit/g3fpgte/,duisThias,1598849048

Moreover, the ""opposition"" actually had parliamentary majority a number of times, most recently just before the previous elections. Usually this majority is broken by some opposition parties deciding they actually REALLY don't like other opposition parties and would rather lend support to government instead.

When someone is scared of flying, what do we do? We use data and tell them that flying is actually incredibly safe and in fact, driving is more dangerous. Flying is therefore an irrational fear to have.

The numbers do not lie, for almost everyone this disease is not bad. One of my friends had it and she said it was just a normal case of the sniffles. 

We did not ban flying after the first plane crashed because we knew that it was statistically rare for it to happen. 

Go outside, get some fresh air and then have a look at the data. 

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm

America has handled this by far the worse than any other country and they have only had an increase of ~10% excess deaths. In America [median age for death is 78](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6928e1.htm) while the life expectancy is also 78. This disease does not deviate from the average life expectancy, while obesity, smoking, suicide, etc. kills people much younger. 

Masks are shit and cause huge pollution, social distancing is for people that are weak, quite a few of the epidemiologists at my uni think this is bullshit as well.

Wrong. Whether they paid enough or not is another matter.

&gt;Junker claimed that a No would also mean Greece would leave the union, not only the Eurozone. Another lie by an EU official. Neither of them happened.

The only reason for that is because the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras begged the EU for 14(?) hours straight to not kick us out and fully surrendered to whatever conditions the EU laid out. If Tsipras intended to leave, by all means we would be out now. Just see the UK. The UK was free to leave and so are we, and it's not the EU's fault that we don't have the guts to do it, whether that's in our best interest or not.

Hm, i don't really accept. I only accept that there are always patriotic elements in every society, that pushes their self interest. There is a small portion of Serbian right-wingers, whose interests are not at all what you want them to be, so you can lie to yourself that you got this thing figured out. There is no bad blood between Serbs and either kind of Montenegrins, nor are Serbs being oppressed by their brethren. Everyone is being oppressed in Montenegro, and Djukanovic is especially hellbent on destroying all traces of Serbian legacy on Montenegrin statehood and society, which is undeniable. Djukanovic's attack on SPC property was the most blatant offense of his 30+ year political career. All Orthodox Christians in MNE, make them Montenegrins, or Serbs, or Danes, consider the SPC as their own, as the SPC does not discriminate between nationalities. You can be a Chinese Orthodox and they wouldn't care and welcome you.

NATO membership of Montenegro was not discussed in any shape or form, in Montenegro. There was no referendum, and the official, EU-backed polls, show that an overwhelming, 90% majority wants Montenegro OUT of NATO.

5364,"&gt; It doesn't make it untrue. And you've shown no indications of neutrality anyway. 

Feel free to show me where that was the case.

&gt; This is the problem: Greece has powerful friends, in big part BECAUSE they follow international law. Separating those two facts makes little sense. If Greece didn't follow international law and wanted to survey in the Dardanelles, it would be the isolated one and Turkey would have the powerful friends. 

Most countries follow international law and they do not have powerful friends. That is not the reality of the world. This idea is really naive. But it does fit about how emotional you are about how the world ""should work"".

The difference is that Greece does not even claim the Dardanelles. If Greece suddenly changed their position, then yes. But Turkey maintains their position since many decades now uninterrupted.

&gt; That's how international law is binding, and you may have done your reading, but you've yet to grasp this simple fact. 

No. That may be how international law is sometimes enforced if it is against the interest of certain powerful actors, but that is now how international law is binding.

&gt; Vigilantism as a word is predominantly pejorative. You've failed to mention you are using it otherwise. I have no reason to believe you agree with the specific instance of what you called vigilantism.

Alright how do you call a group who enforce justice but only when it is convenient for them and otherwise just ignore injustice or even themselves do injustice? I think vigilante fits this description, at least if one switches injustice with international law. Feel free to suggest a better word.

US, France, UK etc quite regularly violate international law especially militarily, because it is convenient to them. But then they also cry about how others violate supposed international laws. How do you call that behavior? Since those countries are one of the most powerful countries in the world, especially the USA, no country can police them or if they can, they don't want to be involved in the hustle. The US and a few European countries blatantly violated Syria's sovereignty, where was your ""international law enforcement police""? UK and US (even Poland helped out) invaded Iraq against international law, where was the ""international law enforcement police""?

Maybe mafia is a better term, as Mafias are also known to do good things when it is convenient to them. Or street gangs, similar to the ones in Brazil who forced people to wear masks and not to go out of their houses, otherwise they beat them up, so that Covid-19 would not spread more.

5389,"You very clearly didn't have a clue what you were talking about, and I had a very simple time calling it out in very specific ways. Ways which you've failed completely to address. In fact, you imply you are smarter than the IT leadership at VW. So, which one of us really lacks humility? 

You didn't answer any of my questions. You danced around with the same generalities you shat out in your previous comment. Sure, I asked how to compete with established players..followed immediately by a clarification asking for the strategy to convince IT leadership to take on the risk of moving to a cloud solution provided by a car company. And you completely skipped it. You also failed to address how they could compete with prices of the large cloud providers who achieve efficiency through their scale.

You say they could just copy what's been done already. But how? The major platforms don't offer open source services, so they'd have to develop them from scratch. Identifying services isn't the difficult part like you suggest. Building and scaling them is the hard part. You also mention building a PaaS on top of AWS and selling that, but I don't see how that gets you off of AWS(or any other provider you'd copy). You suggest ""legislation"" as a means to compete locally, but you literally stopped explaining after just saying the word, legislation. And again, you're showing your ignorance in a couple of ways by suggesting they only need to compete locally. The first being, VW is a global organization with worldwide IT infrastructure needs. Second, one of the biggest draws of using public clouds is they are geographically distributed with offerings all over the world and redundancy across the world. And again, this scale allows them to lower their costs and pass that savings on to the customer.

The company you mentioned as an M&amp;A target, Scaleway, runs 130K servers. I think we can probably agree that wouldn't even be enough to host VW's own workload, let alone host others. You talk about Amazon competing with VW to build cars, but you're wrong there too. Amazon(and the other tech companies who've investing in building driverless cars) couldn't give a fuck less about cars. The tech companies are focused on building the software and instrumentation to make cars driverless. The car is the least important part of the equation. Once a viable driverless car emerges, production becomes extremely important, but whoever makes that first Level 5 autonomous vehicle bundle is going to be in for an unprecedented payday regardless of their initial production levels, since they can license it too.

You said I have a fundamental misunderstanding of how corporations work..but you have failed to show how VW leadership made a ""massive mistake"" by not making a multibillion dollar pivot dependent on legislation that doesn't exists to be able to compete with locally with trillion dollar global juggernauts. What did VW lose by not doing that? You've done a really good job of highlighting the risks with me, but your solutions are extremely vague(""legislation"", ""mergers and acquisition"", ""copy the most loved services""). 

I've got nothing against Sweden or the form of government there. I'd much prefer and multiparty system with a strong social safety net, to go along with strong education and healthcare systems to the flaming trainwreck we have here.

5441,"&gt; So, what are you then, per se? Why are you hiding behind your ethnicity? 

Why would that be even relevant? How does it matter to the arguments?

&gt;The jurisdiction of international law falls upon the countries that have signed said law. Those countries include Greece and France, who will protect their interests ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL LAW. What do you not understand? 

They will protect their claim according to their national law. Their national law abides to the international laws. Countries had territorial waters for quite some time long before the UNCLOS, and the common practice was to simply deal with it bilaterally in regards to people who break your national law. Few years before the UNCLOS, many countries followed already the 12 miles standard. And if anybody disagreed they would handle it on a national level. The same applies to your example here. Yes, France and Greece would abide by UNCLOS, but enforcing it has nothing to do with UNCLOS. That is strictly a bilateral thing.

&gt; By your reductionist logic, no law ever has actual jurisdiction other than its very enforcement. It's simply the stronger enforcing on the weaker, and that's kind of right, but a lot of misguided from your part. Because 'the stronger' in that case is a coalition that is bound by international law. In the case of national law, the 'vigilante' is police and the justice system.

It depends. But the actual rules of international law is that you only have to legally abide by it, if you formally agreed to it. If you did not do that, you cannot be legally obliged. Other countries can still do bilateral actions in regards to you, but that again has nothing to do with international law where stuff is legally binding.

Your example would make sense if those ""police countries"" would actually fight all legal battles equally at least try to, but they do not. They only fight stuff if it is convenient to them. Thus the term vigilante is much more applicable.

&gt; You have to understand that Greece in its actions is bound by the confines of law, while Turkey does what it feels like. On the other hand, Turkey is talking about 'illegal actions' from Greece, while not having signed anything. If you don't understand the difference, I'm wasting my brain. 

Turkey's position is quite stable since the conflict existed, so your description of ""does what if feels like"" is wrong. Yes, Greece is bound, but you make it sound like Greece has to expand it to 12nm, which it does not.

Why should Turkey change their position simply because the UNCLOS was established? The conflict started before that. So you are basically saying, that Turkey has to simply accept Greece's claims, because Greece has signed a treaty, which Turkey did not sign, but because many signed it, it simply should do it.

&gt; The one who truly dismisses actually valid views because of their nationalist affections seems to be you.

In the modern period, debates are common over the extent to which religious, economic, or ethnic aspects of a conflict predominate in a given war. According to the Encyclopedia of Wars, out of all 1,763 known/recorded historical conflicts, 123, or 6.98%, had religion as their primary cause.[1] Matthew White's The Great Big Book of Horrible Things gives religion as the cause of 11 of the world's 100 deadliest atrocities.",Leinster (Ireland),/r/europe/comments/ijfp60/the_polish_women_who_saved_jews_in_wwii_only_to/g3eq6gy/,AbjectStress,1598827657

Προσωπικά δεν αμφιβάλλω για τις ικανότητες του στρατού κατόπιν του Α' Παγκόσμιου, που είχε πολεμική εμπειρία και ικανούς αξιωματικούς. Όποια εκστρατεία και να γινόταν θα την έφερνε εις πέρας, είτε επιθετική είτε αμυντική. Με το να εκλεγεί όμως ο Γούναρης ήταν η αρχή του τέλους. Και το τέλος υπεγράφη οριστικά όταν επέστρεψε ο Κωνσταντίνος ο Α' και μας έριξαν πισώπλατα οι Γάλλοι και οι Ιταλοί, ας μη μιλήσω και για τη συμβολή των σοβιετικών. Επιπλέον ο Βενιζέλος και ο Κεμάλ ήταν φιλικοί εκατέρωθεν, ενώ ο Κεμαλ δεν είχε κανένα λόγο να μην προασπίσει τα τουρκικά συμφέροντα απέναντι στην εχθρική κυβέρνηση του Γούναρη και του Κωνσταντίνου. Και εκεί δε σε έσωζε όχι μόνο ο αξιόμαχος ελληνικός στρατός, αλλά ούτε ολόκληρος ο στρατός της Βρετανικής αυτοκρατορίας. Μακάρι να εξαρτιόταν 100% απ τον στρατό. Πιστεύω ότι μια κυβέρνηση του Βενιζέλου θα το είχε χειριστεί άρτια και θα είχαν αποφευχθεί πολλές εχθροπραξίες και εν τέλει γενοκτονίες, εκατέρωθεν.

If the train to Berlin took the same time and costed the same as plane (say, 4h and 40 euro), only then we could start chastising people for flying. On the other hand, you do have excellent connection from Amsterdam to Paris, Brussels and London, and you have to be mental to choose flying.

I have a theory of my own (or maybe there is already a research proving it), that all the differences like this are caused by the physical distance between Slavic peoples. I.e. the words' meanings although came from the same roots started to deviate as people developed.

For example, Polish ""czaszka"" essentially denotes a bowl-like object (skull resembles a bowl). So it might have been that some time ago the word was chosen by Poles to denote a scull and the other meaning was just ""divided"" among synonyms like ""kubek"", ""miska"", ""szklanka"", ""donica"".

More importantly, there is the word ""czasza"", which actually preserved its ""bowl"" meaning in Polish: [https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/czasza](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/czasza)

So I think it is a matter of etymological research to actually explain these differences.

5796,"&gt;I fail to see your reasoning. It would be very easy to secure those islands just by geographical advantages for Turkey. You could secure them with very low risk from the Turkish mainland, without even risking a naval attack.

And then you will be sitting ducks to enemy naval and air assets. Holding the islands is only feasible if you control the surrounding sea and air space.

&gt;How are you going to do that? The narrow passage from Turkey to Samos or Kos can be secured by sea and air very easily. You can land some mobile anti air stations and land to air/sea missiles and it is fortified like Alcatraz.

We are saying exactly the same thing. They can be secured by sea and air. If you do not control sea and air, you will not be able to do anything, no matter if you are the person already on the island or not. If 50% (random number) of the Turkish fleet and air-force is destroyed from a Greek ""first strike"", there will not even be an attempt to land on the island, despite it being theoretically possible with small boats, because a) it will be extremely easy for the island to be retaken by Greek forces and b) the assets that will be used for the invasion and support are better needed elsewhere. 
Again, this is not an attack on Turkey's abilities. Exactly the same is true for Greece. A possible Greek ""Alcatraz"" island, like you mentioned, will fall really fast if it cannot be resupplied / supported by Greek naval and air assets. There is a reason why even the Greek islands that are allowed be militarized only have a ghost force and a couple of AA missiles batteries. 

&gt;I would 100% agree with your hypothetical case if those islands were middle in the Aegean where both mainlands are far away. But alone logistically the distance to Turkish shore is a very big disadvantage for Greece to hold or secure them.

The hypothetical focuses on supporting the soldiers already on the island, both in terms of firepower if needed and with supplies. The key to that is naval and aviation forces. 
Two old destroyers can sit 50 miles away from the islands and fire missiles / have helicopter operations all day long. Weather permitting they can even be equip and use proper attack helicopters. If Turkey cannot contest said ships and helicopters (which can only really happen with ships and planes), what good does holding the island do? Providing targets for practice? Yes, Turkey has an advantage based on proximity because it is like it has multiple ""semi-stationary old destroyers"", but its not an advantage that can overcome a potential Greek superiority in regards to ships and planes. 


If you are having a hard time envisioning what I suggest, look at the Falklands war. When Argentina lost control of sea and air, the islands fell to a 4000-soldier strong invasion that only lost 25 soldiers. Yes, there was a balance difference between Argentina - UK, but there will be an equivalent balance difference on the Turkey - Greek war if one side loses most of its navy and air forces.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/ij8tjc/the_eus_biggest_standing_armies/g3de8pn/,Etoiles_mortant,1598806553

Obviously can never represent poverty anywhere in any way or form, since you're weighing poor against rich people to get the median income. But you can never tell how many people are how poor or how few people are how rich by looking at the median income. What you want here is a distribution of median wealth for *each* percentile: how much the poorest 10% make, how much the second poorest 10% make, and so on until you get to the richest percentile. Then you look at the difference between the first 9 percentiles. If the curve is relatively flat, most people will probably keep the wallet. If the curve climbs steadily and does so early, most people will probably return the wallet.

Median wealth is a very bad economic indicator we should almost never look at unless we're trying to trick people into thinking the average salary is higher than it is. Most people make way less than the median wealth. Sometimes its' 70% that make less than the median wealth, sometimes it's 90% that make less than the median wealth.

5890,"I'm not here to defend extreme nationalism but there are major differences between your examples and Trianon.

&gt; you never see Swedish people that claim ownership over Finland or some shit like that

How many Swedes were forced outside Sweden (without leaving their house) to be second-class citizens when you lost Finland? Today Under 290,000 Swedes live in Finland, there are still ~2,17 million (22% of Hungary's population) Hungarians living as minorities due to Trianon *today*, and that number and proportion was larger at the time of the Trianon treaty.

How were Swedes treated in Finland? Were Swedish children beaten for speaking Swedish in schools? Were Swedes denied protective equipment at work? Being physically assaulted or sexually harassed due to their ethnicity? All these happened to my family in Romania up until the 80s.

What is the historical significance of Finland to Sweden? (I genuinely don't know.) Many of our greatest military victories happened, greatest poets, writers, musicians and rulers were born or buried, the settings of our famous novels took place, our martyrs were executed etc. outside our borders. Many of those monuments are still regularly vandalized by nationalists. Is that happening in Finland to Swedish memorials and cemeteries?

Are Finnish politicians specifically using Swedes as an internal enemy (much like Gypsies, Jews and Muslims these days) to gain nationalist votes? Are they [specifically provoking](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/gj4ltg/romania_passes_law_celebrating_the_treaty_of/) reactions?

I admittedly know little about it but I suppose your answer to most of these is ""no"".

There are also other circumstantial differences.

&gt; to the general Austrian view of St Germain

Trianon happened at the end of WW1 which Hungary didn't want. Our PM, Tisza specifically took a stance *against* provoking Serbia and starting a war. If you see Trianon as a punishment inflicted on the loser by the victor, then Hungary was punished for a war that Austria started for us.

If you see Trianon as bringing equality to ethnicities in the region, it failed at that too. At the Paris talks the Hungarian delegation was barely listened to, they were presented a treaty they had to sign. If borders followed ethnic lines, there would've been a minority of Hungarians stuck outside Hungary's borders, not 30%+ of the Hungarian population. (Btw this is the main point of contention: Hungarians claim that [this map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Ethnographic_map_of_hungary_1910_by_teleki_carte_rouge.jpg) showed ethnic borders, our neighbours - mostly Romania, used to be Slovakia - claim that those millions of Hungarians were just minorities everywhere.)

The real point of Trianon was that France and the UK wanted to weaken Germany and its allies, Austria and Hungary. The borders were specifically drawn to weaken our infrastructure, railroads were cut off, industry lines, crippled and most natural resources were given to our neighbours. (Both Austria and Hungary ended up allying with Germany in WW2. Funnily enough, Hungary's main reason was that Hitler promised to restore post-Trianon borders.)

I'd also mention that France and UK used the ethnic justice reasoning for the borders. The same France that managed to forcibly assimilate almost all of its ethnic minorities and still barely considers any minority languages today. The UK that was still actively oppressing the Irish. And both were still having colonies around the world. So the entire justifications was just hypocrisy used for geopolitical objectives.

Finally, Sweden lost Finland 110 years before Trianon. Trianon was also a century ago, but Hungary didn't really have the time to cope. Right at the end of WW1 we had a communist coup, then an authoritarian regime until WW2, then the soviets occupied us and *forced us* to be silent about ethnic questions, you could never bring up the treatment of Hungarian minorities because it was ideologically unacceptable by the international socialist revolution.

I'm **not** trying to justify nationalist hate. In fact with most of our neighbours we are past that, I've never met a nationalist demanding territory from Austria, Slovenia, Croatia or Serbia. Regarding Ukraine there's some dispute about language rights and dual citizenship. With Slovakia being in the V4 helped and in fact at the 100th anniversary of Trianon the [Slovak PM invited 100 ethnic Hungarians])(https://hungarytoday.hu/trianon-100-hungary-and-slovakia-on-verge-of-finding-common-ground/) with the motto “We did not write the past, but the future is in our hands.” Romania in contrast [passed a law to celebrate Trianon](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/gj4ltg/romania_passes_law_celebrating_the_treaty_of/).

 He is responsible for bad results at foreign diplomacy. I'm not responsible for what our politicans say but I am responsible to defend my countries rights as a citizen. 

I just want you to know that this subject is a huge thing beyond Erdogan's political maneuvers for elections. 


To the subject:

3nm territorial water limit was set on Lausanne agreement in 1923 both for Turkey and Greece to create the balance. 

Greece declared the 6nm in 1936. This decision is not denied by Turkey due to the good relationships with Greece and showing good will at that time. Turkey was increased the limit to the 6nm too  at 1964.

In 1982, UNCLOS declared that countries can increase the limit UP TO 12 nm - not exactly 12nm - while keeping the principle of justice.


You can see the difference between 6 nm vs 12 nm

https://greece.greekreporter.com/files/12Miles-ok.jpg

No international open seas at all...

You should answer if this fits the justice principle
 of UNCLOS.

5928,"&gt; But there’s several factors people don’t seem to be taking into account. Firstly, the virus appears to be pretty much over in Europe: most nations like Germany,Italy, Spain and UK have seen a massive decline in deaths since April. Yes, the cases are rising at the moment; but there is more testing being done and, without a corresponding increase in deaths, it’s wrong to say infection is increasing.

The virus is *not* over, at all. Infections are rising in most of the continent and deaths *are* rising in France, Spain, Romania and Ukraine, just to name the ones where the increase is most apparent.

&gt; the vast majority of cases will be false positives

No, not really.

&gt; The point is, governments are still treating the situation like it is March/April 

They aren't. Otherwise, most of Europe would be on lockdown. 

&gt; when, in fact, the situation is much better. 

Yes, much better than in March/April. But much worse than one month ago. After improving from spring to summer, the situation is worsening again, and we should not wait until we have again hundreds of deaths per day before taking action.

&gt; So people are starting to get annoyed with the continued restrictions that they think are unnecessary now, purely detrimental to people’s livelihoods for no reason. 

No, not really. Most people are annoyed but are mature enough to understand that the (very mild) restrictions currently in place are necessary. A few immature individuals, who can't understand that we are no longer in the March/April situation *thanks* to the restrictions, and that we will go back to that situation without them, are the protesters.

&gt; Also, I hope you don’t mind me assuming you are Italian, but I don’t know if you heard the news about an inquiry into your leader’s choice to create a national lockdown? Italy was the first country to do this (nationally) and it was claimed they were “following the science” - but the recommendation had just been to lockdown the region in the north, not the whole country. That was a decision the Italian prime minister made himself, against the advice of his scientists.

Yes, I am aware of that - politically motivated - inquiry. I am also aware of what happened in the following months. Conte did not go *against* the advice of the scientists, he just took a more prudential approach. And I applaud him for this; it was his decision to lock down the entire country that prevented any meaningful spread of the virus in most of central and southern Italy. After weeks of wasting time, he took a decision that *preceded* the virus rather than *follow* it. Otherwise, our death toll would have been twice or thrice as big, if not even worse. It was the scientist's commitee, by the way, that later decided to prolong the lockdown till early May even in the south.

&gt; Australia has the police out on the streets arresting people by force just for leaving their house more than once a day. Is this really necessary to save lives?

First, I think you are dramatizing the Australian situation a bit too much. Anyway, comparing Australia's covid death toll per million inhabitants with those of the countries (including both mine and yours) that waited for the situation to be catastrophic before enacting a lockdown...

New monument to Trianon, FIDESZ really likes them. This one is hilarious as it contains every village name and city from the  Transleithania (  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lands\_of\_the\_Crown\_of\_Saint\_Stephen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lands_of_the_Crown_of_Saint_Stephen) ), with thousands of these villages and cities never being inhabited by Hungarians. That's what's an irredentist policy on a state level. Curious that no neighbour of Hungary complained about this shit (Quite hard when Vucic is best buddies with Orban, and our government is quite busy with doint nothing). 

Also the Hungarian state did the same thing they cry about, with the Second Vienna award. That is being greedy and taking a lot of territories that weren't inhabited by Hungarians in a big proportion (Maramures county or Bistrita county for exemple).  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern\_Transylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Transylvania). They had the chance to be the better ones and acted as greedy as the others.  

Now in Romania the Hungarian minority is used for political points by Romanians politicians and Hungarians ones which is really sad to see.
