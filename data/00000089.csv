31,"&gt;The ‚ÄúUnited Kingdom‚Äù is united because of the anti-catholicism and accidents of birth of certain people in the 16th and 17th centuries. Devolution, as seen in Ireland in the early 20th century is merely a stepping stone to letting people make their own choices about how they want to be governed. The fact that the English were *slightly* more polite about having Scotland join GB than Ireland makes no difference. The english didn‚Äôt even give them a ceremonial rock back for like 600 years, purely out of spite.

You're horribly misinformed.

Firstly it was a Scottish King who inherited the throne of England, paving the way for a century of 2 sovereign countries being united under a common monarch. The Act of Union 1707 came about largely due to a failed Scottish colonial adventure in Panama, bankrupting the country and aristocracy and defaulting on some debts iirc. The English Government at the time sought to pay Scottish debts if they entered a union into England and the Scottish Government obliged, thus the United Kingdom of Great Britain was born.

Devolution has benefited the Scottish Parliament due to increasing control over their own taxation rates/healthcare/education and other formalities. 

Ireland joined the UK via the Acts of Union 1800. The Republic of Ireland is now a separate, sovereign country thus it's Northern Ireland that's still a part of the isle of Ireland under the Act.

&gt;Forcing Scotland to remain part of the UK when their politics and people differ so much in opinion from those of England, because of some imagined ‚Äúthreat to UK sovereignty‚Äù is as daft as the EU forcing Britain to remain part of it despite brexit. Or do you think they should have done so to protect EU ‚Äúsovereignty‚Äù?

England isn't unanimous in their advocacy of a particular political party and neither are any of the home nations in the UK, including Scotland. Scottish views are better represented in the Scottish Parliament as Scots constitute a minority percentage of Brits and local government always trumps national government in respect to local/regional issues. 

The Act of Union formed Great Britain and it shall remain as such.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/gxnepo/poll_should_scotland_be_an_independent_country/ft3q6eg/,EruditeofNature,1591441798

I take it you aren't aware of the climate existing over here about these things.

This country began (sorry for lack of better term) ""swarming with refugees"" when the Lebanese civil war began in the mid-1970s when we housed over 30 thousand souls and then expanded with the Iran-Iraq war, Turkey's fight with Kurdish separatists, the Libyan intervention, the Gulf Wars, and put on twelfth gear when Yugoslavia, Albania, and the rest of the eastern block crumbled. 

Greece went from 2% foreign-born population in the 1980s to 11.1% in 2011; for comparison, France currently sits at 10%.

Simply put, *no-one* wanted to get involved in a conflict that would create even more refugees.

People seem to be beholden to the narrative of ""Imperialist powers corrupt a revolution to get their proxy islamist militias in power."" Let me tell you that Hafter is supported by Russia, France, Egypt, UAE - none of them indigenous Libyans either. Also, consider [this](http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/T-Briefing-Papers/SAS-SANA-BP-Tripoli-2019.pdf) source, a briefing paper by the Small Arms Survey. From page 12 on beings the chapter ""Who is fighting for Haftar?"" and on page 13 we can read:

&gt;The groups that have joined Haftar‚Äôs forces from Sabratha, Sorman, Tiji, and Badr are dominated by Madkhalist Sala-fists.92 This also applies to many of those who have joined Haftar from two former revolutionary strongholds: Zintan and Rujban.93 In all these towns Madkhalist preachers have made significant inroads in recent years and provided staunch support for Haftar (ICG, 2019).



Look we can't just take what happened in Syria and think the very same happened in Libya. Libya has been spared much of the destruction and the intensity of violence was much lower. Less people per capita fled from Libya as from Syria. 

The Libyan war after the intervention was about the divison of spoils and the integration of militias into the government. To not repeat the same mistake as Iraq and have thousands of unemployed soldiers, the government paid each milita a salary. This backfired however because there was not much else going on economically so you had a motive to establish a milita to get state funds.

The current war in Libya is about elites, tribes, towns and people that were prosperous before 2011 because they were favoured by Ghadaffi versus those that were not, rebelled, and came to power post revolution.

That in hindsight everything was better before the war is clear.

501,"&gt;That's not how it works. You either have to shut down the nuclear plants or the renewables during peak production times. That's a waste, and makes everything more expensive. Might as well use the dirt cheap renewables with gas and come out cheaper.

If you install enough renewable capacity to supply for peak demand, you'll *already* have waste whenever your renewable fleet is at peak production but demand is lower. And if you *don't* install enough of such capacity, then your grid will obviously remain carbon-heavy.

I don't see how what you advocate for is better. Under a nuclear baseload + renewables + gas scenario, you can install a bit less renewable capacity than (peak - baseload), having gas pick up the slack whenever renewables are down, all the while avoiding a carbon-heavy grid since a low-carbon source is already accounting for the bulk of demand.

&gt;At a cost. Every second they don't run at full capacity means that the price per kWh over their lifetime goes up.

But that *also* happens in a renewables + gas only scenario. For renewables to supply a sizeable enough share of electricity, you need installed capacity to be *way* over baseload, because of renewable sources' low capacity factor. This means excess power generation, eventually forcing some renewables sources to shut down.

This has already begun, by the way. Despite being nowhere near satisfying grid decarbonation yet, Germany often sees renewable production spikes that exceed demand. For now, they can afford to sell (sometimes at negative prices) excess power to their neighbors, which have low renewable penetration.

But what would happen if every European country adopted the same energy policy? Because of geographic proximity, peak renewable production would be attained more or less at the same time in neighboring countries, and there'll be a lot less room to offload all the excess power. This would make such offloading either physically impossible, or so costly for the producer that turning the source off would be profitable.

&gt;I see no reason why renewables should shut down to allow nuclear to run optimally.

And I see no reason why intermittent renewables should have state-mandated grid priority over other low-carbon sources and guaranteed buying prices regardless of demand, yet here we are.

&gt;It will lead to the production of synthfuels, most probably synthetic methane, which can simply be pumped in the existing natural gas network. This means that the gas plants that will be used to fill in the gaps of renewable production will *also* be renewably sourced. Eventually, the excess production will start to provide for heating too.

I'm pretty sure we've already discussed this before. Yes, that would be great, but today power-to-gas capacity is pretty much non-existent, and it will take decades before it increases to a sufficient level to support a renewable-only grid.

And even once it does, renewable prices per kWh will *still* rise significantly. Not only because you'll need to pay additional maintenance and construction costs for your gas production, transportation and turbine infrastructure to produce a unit of dispatchable energy, but also because fuel synthesis induces significant heat losses.

This means that renewable sources will need to provide even more electricity per unit of heat provided to the end user, and *way* more per unit of electricity provided to that same user, since heat losses of gas production and gas combustion are combined in a power-to-gas-to-power cycle.

Additionally, the massive increase in renewable production that would be required to compensate for heat losses would also mechanically reduce the yield of newly installed renewable plants: Since the best geographical spots for solar and wind generation will already be taken, this additional renewable production capacity would need to be installed in less ideal areas, which will reduce their capacity factor. Generally speaking, you get diminishing returns the more renewable capacity you install.

But the worst part is that by installing gas-based heating and electricity production infrastructure before gas is carbon-neutral, you'll necessarily increase fossil gas demand, in turn increasing energy sector CO2 emissions, or at the very least limiting its diminution.

(BTW, synthetic methane strikes me as an odd choice. Methane is a GHG with 25 times the warming potential of CO2. Methane leaks already account for a significant chunk of the fossil fuel industry's CO2eq emissions. It would be quite an impressive feat to use renewable sources to generate and release highly potent GHG into the atmosphere. Rather counter-productive, too.)

&gt;Nuclear is only clean if you swipe the fuel mining, the waste, the disaster risks, and the proliferation risks under the carpet.

And intermittent renewables are only clean if you swipe the material mining, the associated chemical waste, the manufacturing process (aka why PV solar produces \~100gCO2/kWh, rather than wind's 10-20 range), the CO2 generated by reliance on fossil gas, the energetic dependency to Russia for fossil gas and to China for PV panels, the significant space required which displaces farmland further into natural habitats, and all the environmental costs that storage infrastructure construction and maintenance will eventually incur under the rug.

No power source is clean, including renewables. They all have different downsides. Personally, I'd much rather have the following downsides:

* Low-probability of a local accident,
* Having to develop long-term waste storage infrastructure... that we need to build to store existing waste either way
* Risk of nuclear proliferation (that can be alleviated by using specific reactors EG thorium)

Than these:

* Certainty of global climate instability
* Rise in sea-level that will destroy more inhabitable and arable land and displace more people than nuclear accidents ever will. Loss of inhabitable and arable land through extreme, seasonal heatwaves
* Extinction of species (which took millions of years to develop, more time than high-risk radioactive waste even lasts) on a *massive* scale
* Dwindling of basic resources such as water, leading to (potentially nuclear) war over these resources, especially in high-tension areas such as the India/Pakistan region. Massive waves of climate refugees, and the associated rise of far-right parties
* Collapse of farming yields, leading to mass starvation
* Higher frequency of potentially deadly pandemics, due to climate-related displacement of species (EG mosquitoes)

Climate change is, quite simply, a *much more* threatening and pressing issue than whatever nuclear could throw at us. I would also rather pick the power source that kills the least amount of people per kWh by far.

Reliance on fossil gas is simply *not* an acceptable downside. It should be removed from our energy sector entirely, not just power generation. Renewable-only transition plans are not currently viable for this very reason.

Even once suitable energy storage infrastructure is ready, it *still* makes more sense to use baseload nuclear + renewables, because it requires a lot less storage capacity to account for variable demand without baseload than it does to account for variable demand *and* baseload.",,/r/europe/comments/gvdm10/uks_decade_of_decarbonization/ft1d7f3/,Perett2822120,1591405510

1) not extreme nationalism just normal one.

2) and 3) according to data gather by the EU Poland is only slightly worse(few % difference) in racism and anti-semitism then Germany, for exmple to question comfortable you would be if your child would be in relationship with black person, 58% of people in germany(in italy its 62%) are comforatable with it, while in Poland its 54%, while its true its far from perfect, in France and UK its higher, but on other hand we are much better compared to other eastern european countries, for Czech republic its 23%, Estonia its 44%, even for Greece its 41%.
So while Poland is far from perfect it still comperable to to west.
To add to that we had Dark skinned person as politican(John Godson) and he said himself he didnt have negative experiances with racism in Poland, of course I am not saying there is no racist people here, there are but they arent common.

Same question when asked about relationship with jewish person Poland also is only slightly below Germany.

when asked this question about Muslim, I wont lie we end up looking worse, BUT not even Germany looks good here since below 50% of people in Germnay would be comfortable with their child being in relationship with muslim.

I do want to mention though that Poland has muslim minority that lived here just fine with no problem for very long time, the tatars.

media are manipulative thats true but there were some polls done it it was shown that actually many of people supporting government realize public media are full of propaganda and are tired of it., so its not that bad.

(my emphasis)

The supreme court could only try questions of law, while having to go by facts and evidence established by the lower court. Part of that was that **the trade marks were not put there by Apple**.

So, provided that the determination by the lower court was correct (and I managed to decipher the Nynorsk), it was **not** the case of the logos being there because they originally were on a genuine screen, part of which had then been replaced.

745,"Idea of this healthcare reform is that services could be provided more efficiently. Population is aging, healthcare costs are rising and workforce is getting smaller.

Currently Finnish public healthcare has 3 layers:

Municipalities are taking care of ""basic healthcare"", like dental services, basic doctor visits etc. Many municipalities provide these services together with other neighboring municipalities.

Health care districts (sairaanhoitopiirit) run hospitals and provide surgeries etc. Areas of health care districts are same as regions of Finland, that there are 21.

Then health care districts are bundled with some other ones to form ERVA -areas, which there are 5, so one ERVA -area equals approximately 1 million people. Each ERVA -area have one university hospital. They provide even more specialized services, like more complex surgeries and cancer treatments.

Most specialized surgeries and treatments are centralized, like lung and heart transplants, face transplants etc, mainly to Helsinki area.

&amp;#x200B;

So this reform (in its current form), would make health care districts to take care also of basic healthcare. These healthcare district would be governed by regions, where new layer of governance and elections would be formed. Still, many people argue that all healthcare should be managed directly by ERVA -areas, basic healthcare as well.

I still want to say that by [some papers](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2818%2930994-2/fulltext), current quality of Finnish healthcare system is 6th best of the world with most bang for the buck.

That's because it's untrue. If the eco movement had their way, they would have started replacing coal with renewables back in the 70s and 80s, for the acid rain issue if nothing else. They just weren't powerful enough yet at that point.

Then the 80s and 90s would also have seen replacement of nuclear with renewables, and then they would now be busy with the replacement of heating and transport fuels, instead of still being forced to deal with basic electricity.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/gvb39v/greenhouse_gas_emissions_per_capitain_tonnes_2017/ft0k32s/,silverionmox,1591392159

781,"That is a hard one.

It all depends on how you view *democracy*. I gather that most of your friends define *democracy* in modern terms. Meaning that *democracy* is actually a short-hand for few things that create a functional political system.

So to understand that, let's visit the most common defintion, stemming from its linguistical origin. Democracy, as pretty much every person on this planet knows, is coming from Greek, and roughly translates to ""the rule of the people"". Most people on Earth also get accustomed to knowledge about ancient Greek democracies, ie Athenian demoracy, where literally majority of the people could enact any law they wish, provided they achieved majority on a public forum. 

But ""the rule of the people"" that doesn't say much, does it? I will save you hundreds of years of political history and let's fast forward to relatively modern times. Modern democracies, usually root themselves in couple of principal thoughts.

First is discussed rule of majority, that is *the essential* cornerstone of democracy. Its roots go back to ancient Athens.

Second is the rule of law. Countries thrive on stability. By having a code of laws that govern the people, we are able to avoid bloodshed and make peaceful transtions of power. This is another important cornerstone. It also directly affects the people, as it is a ground for ""civilised"" political discussion. Political actors *must* adhere to laws that bind common people and they *must* deny and resent any sign of violence in resolving conflicts.

Third is balance of powers. In the aftermath of the Enlightenment, it was *highlighted* that even the brighetest, and the best of us will always think primarily about themselves, when given unchecked power. This is another cornerstone. You can derive it either from politcal thought of Jean Jaques Rousseau or from the teachings of founding fathers of the United States. So you need seperate legislative, executive and judicial powers in the country.

I think that success of the country you reside in, the USA is thanks to safeguarding balance of powers and the rule of law. Please make notice, that these two rules restrict the absolute will of the people from the first rule. You can't, for example, banish people anymore, just because 50% +1 people feel like it.

So getting back to Poland. PiS has been working hard on undermining rule two and three from almost the first day they got into power. I think other people can give you more details into that matter. Enough said, that Poland has cases in European Court of Justice and long-standing confrontation with European Comission about that. The most egregious example is essentialy creating politcally controlled (by Minister of Justice, who also is Head of State Prosecution) judicial disciplinary commission. Soon they will have first case with a popular judge, Igor Tuleya, who has shown to be assertive to current party actions.

And now, during Covid-19 pandemic, they also started to show disregard to rule of law. Like that prime example with PiS chairman, de facto leader of Poland. He went to cementary to visit departed loved ones, despite being only MP and having no authority to do that. You also have dozens of shenanigans with public money, embezelling money by Health Minister and his brother with Covid-related public offerings, overtaking public institutions, censoring public radio stations, etc.

For me the stroke that broke the camels back, was when they introduced election reform, *during election campaign* without proper public discussion, with so glaring gaps that I was astounded to read that. They essentially decided to strip all institutions that used to organize elections of all power and transfered the power of organizing elections to Minister of State Property and the Postal Office. It was bizarre. Of course, these people were absolutely unprepared to deal with elections, especially considering the short window of three weeks they were given. After two weeks of running around, they transferred the responsibility back to the usual institutions, but forgot to transfer essential competencies and the elections happened without any voting, because of a legal technicality. I still do not know what to think of this. Was this simple incompetence, attempt at illegal power grab or just money-embezellment through Postal office? And I don't even know which would be the worst.

So to answer your question - I think democracy *is* waining in Poland. PiS has been undermining the essential cornerstones of modern democracy for years. They shield themselves with the use of rheotric that the will of the majority of the people is having more weight than proper procedures and respecting the rule of law. But guess what? Supreme will of the people, manifested through Sejm, was politcal doctrine adapted by the communist Poland that enabled poltical persecutions and the martial law in the end.

923,"I don‚Äôt think economic theories work very well as in absolute theories because they don‚Äôt take into account market adjustments. I was having dinner with my dad last night and he was remarking about how shocked he was that there hasn‚Äôt been inflation over the past 13 years despite zero interest rates. 

But that actually makes sense especially in the current world where we‚Äôve had inflation targeting for the past few decades. Like the government could print a ton of money during times of low inflation, but the market also knows that the government can always cut back or raise interest rates later on if inflation got too high, so that anticipation is priced into the reaction. 

Or like, the stock market hasn‚Äôt collapsed like it did in 2008, but it recovered very quickly after 2008 so why would it collapse today? The market hasn‚Äôt collapsed today because everyone is pricing in that it will eventually recover in a few years. 


I think the stagflation of the 1970s was mostly rooted in a misunderstanding of monetary policy at the time. It was only really broken when interest rates were jacked up and the fever of inflationary pressure broke. The same way that the Great Depression was caused by misunderstanding of monetary policy. Prices actually fell during the 1930s and the monetary supply went down in many countries. That would never happen nowadays because if we ever got in that situation again the government would just be printing money like gang busters to prevent deflation. Like it was a crime of gross incompetence that the monetary supply fell back then because printing money is really easy, and obviously necessary.

You may have forgotten, but the Ukrainians were the second nationality in the USSR and they played an important role in the party. Khrushchev, who replaced Stalin, was Ukrainian. And Stalin was a Georgian. Communism is an ideology. And the Ukrainians at that time were her adherents to the same extent as any other nation on the territory of the union. Do you think the evil communists arrived from Mars and began to put people in prisons? No. These were the same people, including Ukrainians. Your Ukrainian relatives were sent to the camp by other Ukrainians, not by Martians.

And as a result: what do the current situation in Ukraine have with the civil war of 1917 and the resistance of ideologies in the first half of the last century?

Yes, the USSR was different: there were good and bad moments. Do you want to forget that the Soviet Union gave your country statehood and most of the territory, but remember only the bad aspects? You are a hypocrite then. If you want to get rid of the bad, then get rid of the good too. Get rid of the territories that the USSR gave to Ukraine and get rid of the statehood that also appeared under the communists.

Your language and national problems would not exist now if you continued to be part of the Russian empire. Very convenient, isn't it?

It‚Äôs criminal that Disney didn‚Äôt even have a full script for all 3 movies. The plots had no consistency. The second movie was by a different director who just went completely the wrong way. Then the third movie just tried to undo all the shit the second one did. 

How fucking hard can it be to write a single story, with a clear villain, good and evil? Instead the second movie had an entire second act on some casino planet to make some social critique about how both sides were the same or something. And everything in the plot was a deus ex machine. Like, nothing they did on that casino planet accomplished anything. 

People actually laughed out loud in my threatre during the second movie when they had that kiss scene. The guy Fin was sacrificing himself to save everyone, but then that girl Rose prevented him from destroying the laser. The character Rose has no idea that Luke would show up to save people, so she was preventing Finn from heroically sacrificing himself just so everyone would die anyway. Then she said some shit like ‚Äúall we need is love‚Äù and then people laughed out loud it was so cheesy and stupid. There were no emotional stakes in that movie!

Some of these indicators are the ratio between housing prices and income, and housing prices and rents. When I write housing prices I mean the price to buy a place. In Munich, the prices for housing are skyrocketing because the supply is too low and people like to move there. Wages are high(er than elsewhere) but not rising as fast as the housing prices. Similarly, rent increases are regulated so they, too, cannot rise as fast as the prices for apartments and houses.

tl;dr: Munich is a very attractive place to live and people move there, which pushes housing prices up whereas wages and rents don't keep up. So, the profit expectations of a real estate investor may be misplaced, which is essentially what a bubble is: false expectations of profit fuelling price hikes that might ultimately not pay off.",near Germany,/r/europe/comments/gwpzvf/global_real_estate_bubble_index/fsza1a3/,boq,1591369934

1062,"&gt; I thought it was pretty clear from what I showed, but since you need it  spelled out, sure. Ukraine has had massive issues that Poland hasnt,  long before us joining the EU. We already were in a much better position  than Ukraine, long before joining the EU. 

No, you had some short term advantages, not in a permament ""much better position"". If that were the case Ukraine would not have started out ahead of you guys and making just 10 years the defining factor here is just grasping for straws. 

&gt; Why do I bother, you will just ignore this like you ignored the fact  that joining the EU hadnt impacted our GDP growth in any significant  way. 

You are entirely correct, I am a bit tired of eastern europeans coming up with the exact same arguments again and again like they were all provided a little book called ""how to make myself look important and how to fuck westerners"". 

There is not one original thought in your post, just the same old party lines spread by hundrets of people before you. 

&gt; Bullshit, maybe start replying to what I actually say and not some  imaginary argument going on in your head. Favors usually arent  beneficial for both sides, which I already pointed out a couple times EU  enlargement was. So tell me again how I supposedly am pushing that... 

Says the guy starting with the insults? Projecting hard I see. 

Every favor is beneficial to all sides involved, else people would not give out favors. the problems starts when people who recieved the favor start denying it, even blaming the other for giving out the favor in the first place.

&gt; No wonder you constantly hear these arguments again and again, if you  are the one saying them to yourself. Nothing I said even remotely  sounded like what you presented, yet thats what you heard. 

Typical. Trying to spin the argument upside down. But then again, that was to be expected. 

&gt; Thats exactly why I said you are blinded to reality. I show how your  assumption (Poland would basically be 2nd Ukraine without EU) is  complete BS, but instead of admitting it or at least rethinking your  stance, all you do is shake your head and ignore the facts. 

Yeah, take a mirror and talk to it, Buddy, should be more productive. You showed nothing but wild speculations that you then present as fact and want others to just run along with it.

GAL - TAN is understood as a dimension along which contemporary political parties often compete which is different from economic competition.  GAL being ""green, alternative, liberal"" and TAN being ""traditional, authoritarian, nationalist"".  So it's libertarian but specifically in a sense to understand sociocultural issues, since the economic aspects of libertarianism you might be thinking of are already in the horizontal dimension. IMO this is one of the weaknesses of the category, it feels like it's based around a number of predefined issues that we see in a unique way in current democracies but not necessarily built to be coherent in every way (i.e. it is not built to classify some kind of eco-authoritarian party).

Similarly if a nuclear armed military power like the UK is no longer in the EU then it's a less of a formidable bloc to deal with in a face-off where the threat of military action may impact the balance of negotiations and brinkmanship.

For example, you don't learn ice hockey on the streets, you learn it by having parents with the time and money to equip you, pay your fees, and take you to and from the ice rink at ungodly hours. 

Whereas the NBA and other sports are, at the beginner's level, totally open to anyone with access to cheap equipment (basketball, football, baseball) and a nearby field or hoop. 

If it involves equipment and fees and the luxury of a parent with free time, and if you have to know people or win the approval of gatekeepers, some people are going to be at a disadvantage.

The aim, the premier said, is for one in three cars in Greece to be electric by the year 2030. The first phase of the plan foresees financial incentives for individuals and corporations to switch to green cars, noting that the government has earmarked 100 million euros for the purchase of electric cars over 18 months. The subsidy will cover an estimated 25 percent of the purchase of 14,000 new electric cars, he said. 

He added, that tax breaks, expected to be unveiled by the government in due course, would make the acquisition of electric cars attractive to both inviduals and corporations. 

Electric cars will pay no road tax for two years, he said, adding that spending on recharging such cars would be deductable from income tax.

As you can see when dealing with gangs the Swedish police almost exclusively has to deal with foreigners (Middle eastern and North Africans as far as I'm aware).
In that case it inevitable that the arrests will be almost close to 100% of people from these countries.
One can easily say by that percentages that the police in Sweden targets certain groups.

What should they do in that case? Should they arrest random native Sweden and apply false charges just to balance the statistics?

Probably for the same reason (increased gang action) they have a higher killing rate than other European countries: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_by_country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_by_country)

Habsburg kings were kept being coronated in Pressburg with the Hungarian crown, Hungarian law continued to be applied, Hungarian diet continued to meet. As for maps, in my experience some dash out an internal border for the kingdom some don't, it depends on the mapmakers whim.

Thing is between 1526 and 1570 KoH definitely existed the eastern half that was unoccupied by neither Ottomans not Habsburgs. After 1570 the title was passed solely to the Habsburgs on the condition that the eastern parts still legally continue to function as part of the kingdom and that Habsburgs respect the laws and traditions of the kingdom in whole.

Then after 1699 Habsburgs tried to submit Hungary which provoked the noble rebellion of 1703-11 that defeated but seeing the resistance the Habsburgs they accepted the terms of upholding the privileges and customs of the kingdom. And I can keep going on, the entire history of Habsburg-Hungarian relationships until 1867 revolves around the emperors trying to reduce while our nobles trying to resist, and it's this struggle that helped maintain it's status as a special entity.

1435,"This certainly looks like a good idea, but the article is rather fuzzy on the details.

1. By what date must stations provide electric charging?
2. How many spots must be provided?
3. What kind of charging must it be? Is it enough to offer a 220V plug, or is some type of fast charger required?
4. Are there any rules around pricing?

&amp;#x200B;

For people saying petrol stations aren't the ideal location, you're right, but this is still a good move. Just making charging available will make people more likely to consider purchasing an EV. Compared to the US, a much lower percentage of Germans live in houses where they can install their own charging port. For a person who lives in an apartment, the ability to charge at a local petrol station (and walk home while the charging is in progress) makes an important difference. 

Lastly, EVs always have a chicken-and-the-egg problem. By forcing petrol stations to  offer charging, this will test the waters to see how popular EV charging stations will be. If there is high demand, this will encourage other businesses to offer charging as well.",,/r/europe/comments/gwqy0m/germany_will_require_all_petrol_stations_to/fsy71pw/,JoeyJoeJoeJrShab,1591341095

In itself it dosent prove that the sofa is shit but its an indication that something is possibly wrong with the sofa.

Now. Could it be that some of these 6000 people of the survey overreacted? Yes. Could it be that they misinterpreted the action as racist? Yes. Could it be that they are assholes that are playing the race card? Yes. Could it be that they actually experience discrimination based on the colour of their skin? Also yes.

If the sofa is perfect, why does 60% felt uncomfortable using it? If racism is not a problem in the EU and they outrage you by using FEELINGS to investigate a phenomenon, then why is that 30% of the interviewed claimed to have been victims of discrimination?

I know you say this sarcastically, but my city implemented a civilian review board because of these protests. The police have been resisting that for 30 years in my city. And now its happening. A week ago? Not a chance in hell.

They also dropped the ""warrior"" training that they had been given, and our governor mandated that every single police officer will be given 100% mandatory training on race relations.

The police in Flint Michigan, known world wide for being an underfunded agency located in a violent dump... The police took off their riot gear and joined the marchers. In Detroit, after one night of violence, the Chief ordered his men to stand down. Detroit hasn't has been calm since.

In just this last week of riots, more than a dozen cops have been fired, 8 cops have been arrested, multiple ""closed"" investigations have been reopened, and the former highest military official in the country spoke out against not only our President, but our police brutality issues. I'm not sure how familiar you are with American culture in that regards but its...well, nuts. Caesar crossing the Rubicon kinda thing.

1640,"Yeah, but most of their taxes aren't aiming at rich, but at normal people, so Poland have high number of small businesses being closed. Some of the social benefits are increasing cost of the employer for each employee which in the end can only result in employees earning less or companies shutting down.

They almost never give tax relief as social benefit, but cash to hand, which do not promote people being professionally active. Lately they tried to give people starting unemployed more money per month than minimum wage, which literally promote being ""losing"" job or moving to illegal work for few months.

In the year they introduced 500 z≈Ç for 2nd and other child, Poland had a huge jump in money spent on alcohol, around 10%, it is hard to believe it is unrelated. For my whole life I saw a lot of small businesses selling vegetables and fruits they bred, in months after new social benefits were introduced I've stopped seeing them, and prices of those things in regular shops increased. Instead of giving those people chance to get honest payment for honest job, they made working uneconomical for them.

I don't agree they are giving the most to the poor people. They gave a lot of money to television controlled by them (2 000 000 000 z≈Ç per year for next 5 years), they gave 14th pension in a year to miners, the most earning profession in Poland (while coal had to be bought by government from Ministry of National Defense saving because there isn't big enough demand for expensive polish coal).

Disabled people had to protest in Sejm and were treated as shit until they finally got something. Similar with teachers, but here government was fighting so hard they even started anti-teacher propaganda, and in the end teachers got nothing, although now they are promising them 6% increase after elections. 500 z≈Ç per kid for long time wasn't even including single parent with child.

Real estate in the whole area around Munich is very expensive. Before corona, newly constructed two bedroom condos sold for around ‚Ç¨ one million, that's about 1.5 million CAD. And they sold out even at those inflated prices way before construction was finished. Several of the most expensive locations actually are not even in Munich itself, but in nearby towns. Many of those nearby towns have a direct train connection right into the city, with service every 20 minutes. Even small towns 30-45 minutes away from Munich can have higher real estate prices than Frankfurt. Overall, real estate prices drop only very slowly as the distance to Munich increases. 

The distance from Frankfurt to Offenbach is just 10 kilometers. Offenbach, a city of 140,000, already is a lot less expensive than Frankfurt itself, and only slightly more expensive than German average.

1813,"&gt; But again using this argument to try and claim that a government or society does not have a racial issues/prejudices is not correct. 

I'm not claiming there is no racism in the United Kingdom. I am claiming that it is a *significantly less* racist place than the United States.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; This same exact thing can be said about America, or any country for that matter. Only issue being that class is associated to race; ie minorities tend to be poorer so race/ethnicity does influence income, wealth and economic opportunities. 

The difference is that the United States persisted with chattel slavery until the 1850s. This hasn't existed in the UK since the early 12th century. Even following the abolition of slavery post-civil war, there were numerous hurdles preventing African-Americans from acquiring land, entering entire professions, accessing credit from banks or even living in certain neighbourhoods (even when they had sufficient wealth to do so). Hence why the gap between the wealth of the median European-American relative to the median African-American is of many multiples, even today.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; That may be so but I wouldn‚Äôt go as far to say that it‚Äôs ‚Äúfar,far greater than the U.K.‚Äù. 

The nearest thing we have had to an entire indentured ethnic group in the UK was probably the Irish in the 1800s, and even then they were nowhere near a ""slave class"" as was the case of their equivalents in the USA. Generally differences in wealth/income between the median member of ethnic groups in the UK are almost always explained by a *non-racial* factor -  i.e.Chinese Britons tend to be wealthier than indigenous Britons since it turns out a higher percentage of Chinese Britons tend to attend university, and of those, a higher percentage tend to study technical degrees which open up more avenues in professions with higher salaries. The British state isn't actively preventing indigenous Britons from studying the same courses in the same proportions that Chinese Britons do.

Likewise, some ethnic groups in the UK (e.g. Pakistani Britons) have substantially lower female labour force participation rates - which unsurprisingly means their households are on average poorer, since they very often have only one income earner, whilst the median household of other ethnic groups are more likely to have 2 earners. Again - the British state isn't actively preventing female Pakistani Britons from participating in the paid labour force at the same rate as say, Slavic Britons.

Similarly, some ethnic groups (e.g. Caribbean Britons) tend to have higher rates of marital breakdown than others - with marital breakdown often being associated with a reduction in household income since one partner leaves. Again, unsurprisingly this means that such groups tend to have lower median household wealth than ethnic groups with relatively high proportions of double full-time earner households with lower rates of divorce, such as Indian Britons. Again - the British state isn't actively incentivising Indian Britons to form 2-parent double-income households and likewise isn't actively preventing Caribbean Britons from doing so at similar frequencies.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The UK also has a problem with racial inequality. 

The only way to have absolutely equal indicators for each ethnic group would be to have a situation where the medians have absolutely equal levels of educational attainment, female labour force participation, household structure, household location, aggregate numbers of years worked, distribution across professions etc.

For example, the median Slavic Briton is quite a bit younger than the median indigenous Briton, has probably lived in the UK for less time than and likely has parents who grew up in a nation with significantly fewer rules preventing expropriation of private property (i.e. they likely inherited less wealth than their indigenous counterparts). Once you take those factors into account the disparity in wealth between indigenous Britons and Slavic Britons is quire easily accounted for, rather than attributable to systematic discrimination against them courtesy of their ethnicity.

Are there people who are racist towards Slavs? Yes. Are there a sufficient number of them in the population to collude to prevent the Slavs from replicating the economic performance of their indigenous counterparts?

1827,"&gt; Can somebody explain why Munich is #1?

Well, here's the long and short of it: 

1. Munich is to Bavaria what Paris is to France: It's the sun in the solar system, wherefrom everything radiates outwards into the countryside. It get all the boons, all the spoils, all the political favours and all the money.

2. Munich is a boom town since at least 40 years; and not by happenstance, but by conscious design of the ruling conservatives and the Wittelsbachs (Bavaria's ruling family during the monarchy) before. Although it should be noted that the former royals at least had the good sense to spread things out a bit over the whole country, which is one of the main reasons why they managed to stay in power for almost 800 years straight. 

3. Munich has always been a social democrat stronghold in the very centre of an overwhelmingly conservative state. Since the ruling conservatives just can't win elections in the capital, they instead out-spent the mayors in hopes of currying favour with the electorate. 

4. Munich is major transportation, finance, research and governance hub with a ridiculous concentration of global corporate HQs. The distance between the government and the corporate sector is rather short in Munich. 

5. Sky scrapers are banned in Munich (to preserve the ""traditional cityscape""). Since real estate developers can't build tall, they have to build wide, which means that the city is literally running out of space by now. 

6. One of the effects of the ECB's extensive QE programmes for the last decade is that Germany as a whole and the southern states in particular are drowing in cash. With space already in short supply, Munich is a prime spot for real estate speculation fuelled by foreign money rushing into the country. If it isn't sunk into German government bonds (hence their negative yields), it's likely ending up in Munich's real estate market.",Charlemagnia - personally vouching for /u/-ah,/r/europe/comments/gwpzvf/global_real_estate_bubble_index/fswwxtw/,ColourFox,1591312169

In 2018 the UK government paid ¬£13 billion to the EU budget, and EU spending on the UK was forecast to be ¬£4 billion. So the UK‚Äôs ‚Äònet contribution‚Äô was estimated at nearly ¬£9 billion.

&gt; The government then gets some of that money back, mainly through payments to farmers and for poorer areas of the country such as Wales and Cornwall.

In 2017, the UK's ‚Äòpublic sector receipts‚Äô are estimated to be ¬£4.3 billion.

So overall we paid in ¬£8.9 billion more than we got back.

The point in their favor is that they didn't have the insane racial policies fascists had but I'm afraid my praise is going to have to end there.

It is not that you are actively trying to screw anybody over, you don‚Äôt hate the ant you stepped on because it was coming too close to your lunch, you do it because it annoyed you that it dared touch it. It‚Äôs life was so inferior in your eyes, that the lunch was worth more than it. This is, of course, an exaggeration, it doesn‚Äôt apply 1-to-1 to our situation but the feeling is similar. Many people from WE, at least in this subreddit, are unable to leave aside their preconception that nothing can ever be slightly better in EE. This results from the idea that if the superior westerners could not or did not solve a problem than nobody else can. It is actually an issue that people from Asia and Africa have been signaling for years and it plays into the White Savior concept, where if a problem in society arises only the enlightened West can find a solution to ‚Äúsave‚Äù everybody else. 

Also, it can be true that EE can have an inferiority complex, but it is quite easy to spot them because they usually try to overcompensate since their self-esteem is so low that they need something to cling to even if it‚Äôs blown out of proportion or simply a lie.

If it was truly about 'them causing problems', why do black and Muslim women and elderly still face the same discrimination, even though their crime rate and the number of problems 'they' cause are much lower than among (for example) young white men? Why do Chinese Dutch face so much discrimination, when they are objectively one of the 'best' performing groups in the country?

1983,"Is it, though? Big disclaimer right from the get-go, I don't seem to find Mr Iohannis original statement anywhere, so I might be misinterpreting it a bit. That being said, shouldn't the primary focus be on the people that lost their jobs and cannot support their families anymore? It's like someone is offering to pay for your rent and food for a month and you are saying that you would rather get an LCD, a new phone, and also make an appointment to the makeup salon while you're at it. I did vote for Mr Iohannis, and I do find it wise to invest in things that would benefit the country in the long run, but jeez, I find this statement disturbing. What if the EU tells us (and rightfully so) that we should have invested in our healthcare, education and transportation infrastructure ages ago? My take on this whole deal is: take care of the people that got hurt during the past 3 months, make sure they still have a place to live in and that they can still feed their families, today and in the following months; make sure you improve healthcare, services and resources for the ones that have been hurt (and will still get hurt, it does not end now) by the pandemic; get the national crisis response system up to speed because DSU did a ""wonderful"" job in communicating with those that were forced into quarantine; offer a stimulus to companies that are willing to re-hire people that are unemployed at the moment and keep them in their position for at least one year. Only when you clear all that can you start talking about investing in the bloody highways - we can't seem to get more than 10 miles of highway done per year anyways. Only then can you begin to think about investing in sustainable energy - I mean, seriously, is this the greatest issue we are facing right now? Should Romania start developing nuclear fusion? Yes, absolutely, but NOT NOW. It doesn't matter if you are left or right. Be a goddamn socialist when the times call for it.

And obviously black people don't just commit the majority of homicides because they are black,  you're right there's all kinds of factors like poverty, inequality, gangs, lack of good schools, lack of infrastructure etc. But saying the majority of homicides are committed by blacks isn't racist, it's just a statistic from the FBI. So there's all kinds of things that have to be done, poverty, inequality, education and culture have to be addressed.
 
Also the part about there being plenty of black people in New England where you live is funny and anecdotal , having a few black friends doesn't count as statistics. Statistically New England is not very diverse, whereas states like Alabama or Mississippi are almost majority black. VT, NH, MA are all 90%+ white, some of the most homogeneous states in the Us.

2126,"&gt; By the 20th century Austria-Hungary was the 3rd largest manufacturing power in Europe and wealth flowed throughout the land. 

Wrong  
  

So you are saying that Austria-Hungary had a larger economy in the 20th century (1900+) than the UK (largest miner of coal, ‚Äúlittle empire‚Äù, fist major nations which industrialized), the USA (not as big as 1940 USA, ‚Äúbut‚Äù still the first country with massed produced cars &amp; skyscrapers etc) or Imperial Germany the world leader of chemistry + the industries from Silesia and Ruhr?  
 We have seen how powerful Austrias manufactory capabilities were in the German-German War (spoiler alert: Austria and its South German Allies lasted seven weeks against the highly industrialized Prussia)  
 Austria-Hungary was no wealthy nation in 20th century. Just look how performed in WW1.  
 Austria-Hungary was no industrialized country, only Bohemia was comparable to its western neighbors.  
 If the wealth was so evenly split and everyone was happy and the wealth was split through the country why were the numerous rebellions and even the Hungarians rebelled? The Austrians didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfrom‚Äù Austria-Hungary for fun after the compromise of 1867. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; All it would have take to draw the borders on the Hungarian ethnic borders

You can't draw it on ""ethnic borders"" because said borders don't even exist. At Trianon, the French Prime Minister Alexander Millerand proclaimed, that *""The nationality situation in Central Europe is such that it is not possible to make political frontiers fully agree with ethnic frontiers""*

The map you're using is deceitful, since it uses the same shade of color for areas with both 100% and 50% Hungarian share of population. A more honest map would reveal that the areas with Hungarian minorities in surrounding countries are actually heavily mixed with non-Hungarian populations. For example, when Hitler gave Hungary Southern Slovakia in 1938, Hungary, along with 503,980 Hungarians, also received 272,145 Slovaks and 1,825 Ruthenians. They joined the around 140,000 Slovaks who were already living in Hungary.

You cannot draw ""just"" borders in Central Europe. It is utterly impossible due to the heavy mixing of populations. This is why the Entente at Trianon also looked at other factors, such as railways and rivers, when drawing the borders.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/gwl5u4/the_real_reason_why_hungarians_are_still_mad/fsvnlnp/,Canal_Volphied,1591290728
2147,"&gt; By the 20th century Austria-Hungary was the 3rd largest manufacturing power in Europe and wealth flowed throughout the land. 

AH was the 3rd most populous nation in Europe(not counting population in colonial territories outside Europe) at that time, so I don't think that's as impressive as you might think it is, and it doesn't really matter, as most of that manufacturing power was concentrated in the Austrian half, namely Austria proper and the Czech lands. The Hungarian part was much more agrarian with the development centred around Budapest, while the rest of the country was rural, even within what is modern Hungary. Try to drive through the Eastern parts of the Puszta, and ask yourself if that region ever saw all that ""wealth that flowed throughout the land"". 

&gt;Budapest was rich and so was Bratislava, Cluj-Napoca, Zagreb, etc.

Just taking Cluj as an example. Around the turn of the century, the city barely had a 100 000 inhabitants, hovering around 80-90 000 before the war, despite the fact that it was the main city in Transylvania, a region which had a significant part of the population(~5.2 million in Transylvania, comparable to the 7.6 million in Hungary Proper). At the same time Budapest was a huge city with over a million inhabitants and a metro system.

2190,"Yeah, going around in circles now, I think I'll end it here. 

&gt;I disagree. The BLM protests are against anti-Black racism. If they are against racism, they should denounce their own high levels of racism (as shown by their not comprehending how Black crime stats skew everything). Instead, they as a culture are behaving very selfish and ignorant.

Additionally, they could use all that energy and focus on their own communities and their blatantly obvious cultural flaws, which for some reason a lot of White Americans ignore or excuse.

Again whataboutism, you could say this agaisnt literally any social movement. Seriously, give me one example to the contrary. Also, racism agaisnt blacks is barely comparable in consequence and scale to black-on-white racism.

 You are also putting all black people and their ""culture"" all in the same boat, ghetto culture is the main cause of black violence, I wouldn't talk about trailer park and white trash culture as of it tainted all white Americans. 


&gt;That doesn't mean racism though. The study you yourself posted concluded there is no bias, didn't it?

I won't link it again, I referenced 2 studies, the first one talked about overall kills, and the second about unarmed kills, both found that unarmed blacks are disproportionately killed - and keep in mind the vast majority of arrests aren't for violent crime, but for drug related crimes, or even lighter stuff. 


&gt;With drug crimes? Yeah, and I really don't give a fuck and many Europeans feel the same way. Probably many Americans too. All because Black communities themselves have a huge issue with their own racism that is never mentioned.

I don't get this, are you admitting irrationality? Sure you don't care, but the people protesting do, that's kind of the whole deal no? Most blacks don't need to worry about turning into murderers, they do need to worry about being searched for drugs and abused, so ofc this statistic matters more than the violent crimes one, especially when even adjusted it shows massive bias. 


&gt;From my (anecdotal) experience, African-Americans have a very tough time dealing with authority (not just White authority, but any).

Compare this to all the black anecdotal evidence of unwarranted police brutality or harassment towards them. 

&gt;There is no proof of racism.

There is proof of a system that is biased agaisnt blacks. I would say that means its racist. 

Again, most black people aren't gonna suffer from brutality in violent crime cases, but on drug cases, and things like forgery or suspicion of theft. Violent crime is a drop in the pond of drug arrests. 

&gt;Like I said, if somebody is going to complain about bad behavior (racism), they CANNOT call out everyone else's bad behavio (racism) and completely ignore or deny their own (Black racism).

They can, because protestors are individuals, and they can personally protest possible police brutality agaisnt them while also not being racists or murderers. Again, if they aren't involved in crime in any way, they don't need to give a si gle fuck about Black crime, this is about their individual rights.",,/r/europe/comments/gumzpy/blacklivesmatter_protest_in_amsterdam_right_now/fsvoovc/,Moifaso,1591291229

Nationalism actually killed off a lot of this. Dialects died out as nation wide standard education taught everyone the ""proper"" way of speaking, regional autonomy was widely reduced, and regional diversity died down as television, transportation, and government policy sought to ""unite"" everyone into being the same identity.

2243,"&gt; Many in the U.S. DO NOT consider blacks equal to them in any way, or just do not consider them at all.

Which sort of equal?

Do you mean legal equality? Everyone should be treated equally before the law, without exception. Anyone who doesn't support legal equality of human beings is a scumbag.

Or, do you mean biological equality? This is the most controversial topic known to man, and the media will tell you that it's settled science and that thinking otherwise is simply racist, but if you take a look at the perspectives and conclusions of qualified researchers (psychologists, geneticists, etc) and their publications in academic journals, it's really not settled. If statistical differences in cognition and intelligence are indeed real (and it's not settled one way or the other, but it leans toward yes), and these differences arise due to or partially due to genetic rather than environmental factors (it seems to be partially genetic but not wholly), one possibility from that very well could be that different groups will behave differently or have different outcomes, even when all else is equal. However, this is automatically dismissed as too offensive to possibly be true. I guess I just didn't realise that evolution functions on the basis of who might be offended. I didn't realse that the Creation story is ""God didn't make us, evolution happened, but evolution didn't apply the same to humans as it did to other species. Therefore all populations of humans everywhere are exactly equal in every manner possible and there are no differences whatsoever"".

To be crystal clear on my take here, anyone promoting biological differences in order to further a political agenda or unequal rights is a scumbag, but that does not mean that we should not consider the implications of such biological differences in an objective manner. Sometimes the truth hurts.

&gt;sounds like something you find on random Facebook groups with very surface level knowledge snatched from who knows what YouTube video

Also you say:

&gt;a lot of old Reds, socialists and communists were fully onboard

But

&gt;The right-wing and centrist parties received exactly two-thirds of the seats, and thus the new Parliament ratified the constitutional amendments which outlawed the Communist Party and its affiliated organizations until 1944.

And that happened after polytical repressions and murders like on photo above and exactly after most democratic [1930 elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1930_Finnish_parliamentary_election), where opinion of biggest polytical party in country didn't even matter.

Let alone reminding you that 300 people who potentially could've become communist leaders and help Kuusinen were arrested just before Winter war.

So, only ideological communists were either killed or ran away to soviet Karelia, or arrested.

&gt;Pretty funny oversimplification right there

If it is oversimplification - why would they be arrested? Did they possess threat or not?

Also you say:

&gt;the Allied didn't want to end up fighting their own ally.

USSR and UK/Fra were not allies at that period. In this triangle Axis-League of Nations-USSR at that period there was non-agression policies between Germany and USSR.

Ribbentrop signed that specifically after Britain and France refusing to sign european collective safety treaties - they've even sent on negotiations admiral Reginald Drax with no authority to make such treaty. France sent general Doumenc with no authority for such treaty either (although he had at least some).

Sending weapons to kill ""ally""? Or potential ""ally""? Nonsense.

&gt;we might want to have these guys on our side

Finnish-German Waffenbrudershaft (brothers in arms) existed since WW1 and Jagers, who ended up leading finnish army. [And ended up only when everything was lost.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapland_War#/media/File:LapinSota.jpeg)

&gt;Holy shit, they kicked the Soviet ass

Prolonged defeat\*

Which wasn't unexpected since bunkers, winter, north, terrain, not very well prepared soviet army etc.

&gt;the Soviets ended up capturing and killing dozens of Finnish border guards

Source, dates?

There were different border control incidents indeed, but for ""capture and killed"" you have to elaborate.

&gt;just part of the continued provocations

Do you want me to quote NKVD reports on finnish border aswell? There was enough spying and shooting. And even hostilities for which compensations were paid.

&amp;#x200B;

**I HATE how we always sit on our high horse yet we consistently do the exact opposite of what we preach.** If you look at what Blue Origin and SpaceX are doing - they are both fundamentally changing space travel forever in the biggest way since the Soviets first put a human into space. Meanwhile at ESA.. India's space agency in many ways are doing far more than the ESA.

What's sad is when you see the Nazi scientist that went/were kidnapped to the US and were kidnapped to the Soviet Union.. nobody questions what scientist the Germans kidnapped before their scientist were kidnapped. They took scientist from all over Europe including Soviets and Jews. That talent still exist today throughout Europe. It's not just in one pocket, certainly not just in Germany but throughout Europe as a whole yet we are as fractured as ever as a union.

SpaceX is vast majority US born scientist and engineers (Elon has addressed this more than once to why SpaceX doesnt hire more foreigners, very strict US law from the Space Race era that still exist today). They used Soviet/American/German space tech for their foundation, decades and decades of research - especially during the space race between the US and Soviet Union but they also went way way beyond that under the guidance of Elon Musk that's spent nearly 2 decades getting where he is today.

An African American (Elon Musk) has done more for the US space agency than ANY - I say again ANY leaders in Europe have in the past decade. That's why Elon Musk is so famous world wide, he does what people say cant be done without the guidance and leadership of big government! Or established car manufacterors. Yet he proves them wrong over and over again.

SpaceX is not the only one in the US. US now has 3 that will be capable of taking people into space. Boeing (lets hope they have a black box on board #burn) and Blue Origin owned by [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com)'s Jeff Bezos. Blue Origin has reusable rockets too, they're already deep into all of this and are vastly better off than SpaceX ever will be due to how it's funded (albeit even SpaceX that requires a lot of fiscal support still beats them in many ways - Blue Origin wont fail unless Jeff Bezos pulls the plug whereas SpaceX must keep investors happy .. mainly the US military which will be their biggest customer aka why Elon never speaks ill of the Pentagon anymore).

&amp;#x200B;

That wall of text is just about rockets to get people to space. That's not even remotely touching on how vastly more advanced every aspect of these systems are from autonomous flight to a radically different looking capsule down to the suits and most important - the fact that space flight will be waaay cheaper than it ever has - from the US of all places where it's cheaper to import things from Germany than to make it in Alabama.

You really should go look at Mars.. go look at how many moveable rovers are on there and the fact that they are ALL from NASA and that they're the largest rovers ever to be launched into space that have actually worked.. only beating their own records. 

I want ESA to be great, I want to beat everyone - we are Europe, we can do this but not when this divided mentality we have today. Not with the structure of government it is today. I don't like more and more government, I like less but you can adjust things to where we get both and where ESA, like NATO asks for more. We preach about how important space is, how important science is and our future yet we don't even begin to touch on the US and now China. It's truly pathetic.

It is true that turkey **did not** sign UNCLOS, For this reason turkey claims that they dont have to abide it and can use their magic pen instead to **legaly** draw their eez and teritorial waters where ever they would like

Unfortunately for their imperialistic aspirations there is something in international law (amongst other fields of law) called **customary law**.

It means that since UNCLOS is accepted by most countries on earth and virtually every legaly valid agreement between countries has been made according to it, it applies to every country regardless of signing it or not.

Even though, Nationalism being also impossibly complicated to apply in historically extremely multi-ethnic border regions was most likely the strongest factor.

2416,"&gt;That is kind of a moot point

This is fact.

&gt; considering that nazis were literally the only nation in Europe 

They literally refused to ""help"" and suggested Finland to accept soviet territory exchange offers.

But, instead, yes, germans helped white guards win civil war, especially in capital Helsinki. Result you can see on photo above.

&gt; only nation in Europe who bothered to help  

For example:

&gt;The United Kingdom supplied 75 planes to Finland (24 Blenheim bombers, 30 gladiator fighters, 11 Hurricane fighters and 11 Lysander scouts), 114 field guns, 200 anti-tank guns, 124 automatic small arms, 185,000 artillery shells, 17,700 aerial bombs, 10,000 anti-tank mines and 70 Boise Armored Rifles of 1937.  
&gt;  
&gt;France decided to supply 179 aircraft to Finland (to donate 49 fighters and to sell 130 more aircraft of different designs arrived after the end of hostilities and did not participate in the war; also 160 field guns, 500 machine guns, 795 thousand artillery shells, 200 thousand hand grenades, 20 million rounds, 400 sea mines and several thousand sets of ammunition were transferred to Finland. Also, France was the first country to officially allow the recording of volunteers to participate in the Finnish war.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sweden supplied to Finland 29 planes, 112 field guns, 85 anti-tank guns, 104 anti-aircraft guns, 500 automatic small arms, 80 thousand rifles, 30 thousand artillery shells, 50 million rounds, as well as other military equipment and raw [materials.In](https://materials.In) addition, the Government of Sweden has allowed the ""Finland's Cause is Our Business"" campaign to collect donations for Finland, and the State Bank of Sweden has granted a loan to Finland.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Danish Government sold about 30 pieces of 20mm anti-tank guns and shells to Finland (the order was called ""Swedish"" in order to avoid allegations of violation of neutrality); sent a sanitary convoy and qualified workers to Finland; and allowed a fund-raising campaign for Finland.  
&gt;  
&gt;Italy sent 35 Fiat G.50 fighter jets to Finland, but five of the vehicles were crashed as they were being distilled and mastered by the personnel. The Italians also handed over to Finland 94,500 Mannlicher-Carcano rev. 1938, 1500 Beretta rev. 1915 and 60 Beretta M1934 pistols.  
&gt;  
&gt;The South African Union donated to Finland 22 Gloster Gauntlet II fighters.  
&gt;  
&gt;A representative of the US government made a statement that the entry of American citizens into the Finnish army did not contradict the US Neutrality Act, a group of American pilots was sent to Helsinki, and in January 1940 the US Congress approved the sale of 10,000 rifles to Finland. Also, the USA sold 44 Brewster F2A Buffalo fighters to Finland, but they arrived too late and did not have time to take part in hostilities.  
&gt;  
&gt;Belgium delivered to Finland 171 MP.28-II submachine guns, and in February 1940 - 56 parabellum P-08 pistols.  
&gt;  
&gt;Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy G. Chiano in his diary mentions Finland's assistance from the Third Reich: in December 1939, the Finnish envoy to Italy reported that Germany had ""unofficially"" sent to Finland a shipment of trophy weapons seized during the Polish campaign. In addition, on 21 December 1939 Germany concluded a treaty with Sweden, in which it promised to deliver to Sweden the same quantity of weapons as it would deliver to Finland from its own stocks. The treaty resulted in an increase in Swedish military assistance to Finland.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In total during the war to Finland were delivered 350 planes, 500 guns, more than 6 thousand machine guns, about 100 thousand rifles and other weapons, as well as 650 thousand hand grenades, 2.5 million shells and 160 million cartridges.

They (except 12k volunteers) didn't wanna die for finnish nationalists - that's true, why would they?

&gt; but no troops were ever sent  

If only rulers of Finland were more experienced to understand that - maybe story would went completely different.

But they were what they were - and that brought Finland to operation Barbarossa.

&gt; as they never actually intended to do anything about it. 

What's even funnier even in plans they were more worried about norwegian nickel mines than Finland.

2460,"""Fun"" fact: The whites not only executed a large portion of the men they captured, but their specific aim was to kill every single woman who had taken up arms. As the famous poet Ilmari Kianto wrote (my free translation):

&gt; Shouldn't the right sentencing tactic be to take off a few percent from the other sex of the enemy? In a wolf hunt the she-wolf is a better target than the male, because the she-wolf will give birth to as bad cubs as her. We have proved that the Finnish reds are beasts - many of their women she-wolves, even tigresses. Wouldn't it be madness to shoot the beasts threatening us? The executioners axe has been put firmly to the hands of the Finnsh people. We have to perform a ""caesarean section"" to the corporeal body of Finnish society - Our surgeon should be the sentence by the people.

The leadership of the white army were influenced by race science and eugenics. They thought that by ""scientifically"" executing the people they deemed the worst offenders they would create a forever docile working class to their disposal. The number of women who served in the red guards is estimated to be somewhere between 1400 and 2000 of which the vast majority were non-combatants. Over 200 were shot in the Hennala prison camp alone, the youngest of them being 14 years old.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/gvz8ah/finnish_civil_war_white_guard_militia_executing/fsukgme/,dharms,1591269190

Though yes, I do partially agree with the first part of your statement, chances are if the Latin American countries were richer and had more geopolitical  interaction with Europe and North America they would be more westernized. Thus being considered part of the Western World. 

&gt;Spain is culturally more closed to Hungary or Canada than to Argentina?

Please tell me what cultural ties Hungary and Canada share with Argentina. Sharing a past colonial history with one nation does not dictate whether it is part of the same ""cultural world"". Otherwise the entire fricking world would be The Western World.

Look, you're trying to make a mountain out of a molehill, here. It could be argued and I actually agree that it should be, that Latin America is included within the definition of the Western World. They share close historical and cultural ties even if they are more distinct than the immigrant nations we see in the Anglo-sphere.

2608,"&gt;The army is not mandatory anymore?

Not since 1996 when Civil Service was introduced. You can just opt-out

What is mandatory is service, be it military, civil or cash. Though you can't just choose to pay, unless you fake

&gt;You can chose to do public service instead if you declare yourself unable to do the army

I mean we can argue it's a choice to go to Civil Protection if you purposely fail the physical test and the computer one. Choosing Civil Service is actually really a choice as they ask you during the draft and you can switch whenever you want

Though depending on where you are drafted, they also ask if you'd rather do Civil Protection 

&gt;Also, civil service takes longer (1,5x) the time of the army, so not an alternative a lot take

40% is not the majority but I wouldn't say it's not a lot

&gt;Only 12% serve? I don‚Äôt know where you got that from

It's a compilation of data from the Federal Statistical Office and data from the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport

70% of conscripts are deemed fit for service, 60% of those choose to serve in the army, the remaining 40% choose Civil Service.

That means 67%^((33% foreigners))\*48%^((men))\*70%^((fit for service))\*60%^((choosing military service))=13.5% of the population actually serves in the army or 27% of Swiss males each year

&gt;Anyway, military guns don‚Äôt have the same regulations as private owned guns so you can‚Äôt look at total gun ownership and say they are subject to the same laws

Military guns aren't accounted for ownership since they're not owned. If we're talking about when you buy them, they're subject to the same rules as regular weapons as you need a WES/PAA in order to buy them

&gt;The overwhelming majority of armed people in Switzerland are active soldiers or are attached to the army

Soldiers or those affiliated are actually the minority in those who **hold** as those are only 140k guns (army size) in a pool of 2 to 3.5mio estimated **owned** guns

&gt;or they are sport shooters or hunters. Apart from these two categories, it is much rarer

We could also argue about that since virtually all guns are owned for those since you only have to declare if otherwise. And I don't think even if you want to own for protection you'll check the *other* box on your acquisition permit to explain that",Geneva (Switzerland),/r/europe/comments/gvwhfc/homicide_rate_deaths_per_100000_inhabitants/fsu4cpb/,SwissBloke,1591254383

Yes, because it's proof that guns aren't the main cause of violence in the US. Drugs, gangs and unhealthy socio-economic conditions are. Cali has some of the strictest gun laws and yet has a homicide rate similar to that of Texas, which has way more lax gun laws.

&gt;**Twenty-four European countries agreed on Wednesday (3 June) to work together on international rail transport and make it ‚Äúan attractive alternative‚Äù over distances where it is currently not competitive.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Transport and infrastructure ministers from across Europe have said they want to build an ‚Äúagenda for international passenger rail transport‚Äù using existing EU tools and fold those services into the bloc‚Äôs Green Deal in a ‚Äúcomprehensive way‚Äù.  
&gt;  
&gt;Every EU member apart from island nations Cyprus and Malta, as well as rotating Council presidency holder Croatia, signed up to the pledge ahead of the transport council meeting that kicks off later on Thursday (4 June).  
&gt;  
&gt;According to the joint letter sent to EU transport boss Adina VƒÉlean, ‚Äúinternational passenger rail transport is presently not performing to its potential within the EU. Domestic rail markets are much further developed.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;The ministers cite the Green Deal‚Äôs carbon neutrality objective, the continued rise of greenhouse gas emissions from transport and the European Commission‚Äôs intention to declare 2021 ‚Äòthe year of rail‚Äô, among the reasons to double down on international services.  
&gt;  
&gt;A new agenda should ‚Äúoffer the legal \[‚Ä¶\] framework for attractive alternatives to make railway become an attractive alternative in distances in which it is not currently competitive‚Äù, the letter adds. The idea is to agree on a calendar of milestones within 12 months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Issues such as complex ticket buying systems for multi-leg journeys with different companies should be addressed by digital solutions, it adds. Frequent rail travellers have long called for an online platform similar to ‚ÄòSkyscanner‚Äô to be set up, perhaps by the EU.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ministers also insist that international services can increase their share of passenger numbers in the 300-800km category, suggesting that rail will be taking the fight to short-haul flights, which generally fall under the 1,000km mark.",,/r/europe/comments/gwcei3/24_countries_sign_pledge_to_boost_international/fsu4ob1/,Robi_damian,1591254659

You are using postmodern methodology to brush over everything as non-corroborated, and if you look into the basis of that type of method, you‚Äôll find that it is based in the idea that nothing is ever objective fact (given that facts themselves can take on many interpretations, you can merely pick and choose whichever suits your ideological aim).

However that in itself is wrongheaded. There exist clear limitations on interpretation in every case, which absolutely demolishes any claim that it is unlimited.

Therefore your claim that ‚Äúhe cannot read statistics correctly‚Äù I will now throw back in your face and accuse you of ideologically based bias. I will secondarily accuse you of seeking power rather than truth and that this in effect makes you counter to the Western Socratic-Christian ethic; in other words: ‚Äúyou bad‚Äù

But furthermore, I will counter your comment that I am ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù; I am not, I am a former card carrying socialist. I have not altered my aims (to make the world better for people), I have merely changed my tactics based on a better understanding of economic information (that capitalism leads to higher productivity and thusly average wealth and thusly lesser human suffering). I‚Äôm an advocate for capitalism in that it creates a better life for people (undeniably according to stats). I have therefore a huge proof that I am willing to change my mind based on new information, which eliminates the possibility of calling me bigoted.

Not really as not all long guns need an acquisition permit

We also don't have license to own, nor assault weapon law

&gt; guns are very rarely just carried around like that in Switzerland

Sure a carry license is basically impossible to get as a regular citizen since you need to prove you either need it to work or you're under threat, but they're just as easily bought

&gt;all private sales require a license if you're buying a handgun

While you federally don't need an ATF form 4473 for private sales, you're technically still subject to US code which has the same requirements as the form. Of course you can't verify half of those but still, you could be prosecuted for selling to a felon

&gt; Ultimately, what sets apart Switzerland and the US is the *access* to the guns that the people have 

We have access quiet alright. Guns are easy to come by and to buy. Moreover you can store them loaded and on your bed table if you want 

&gt;The Swiss need to store their guns in a safe

Not at all. A safe is only required if you own a full-auto and only for this gun

Yeah no. Unless it was lying around outside your home you won't have trouble if it's stolen because you were following the law

Hell my club got an **actual assault rifle** stolen and all we got was a slap on the wrist because we didn't do anything wrong

Our statistics are very heavily skewed by specific areas - not specific cities/towns, but specific parts of them.  While I do think our crime tends to be higher than Europe even outside of those areas, the difference is nowhere near as stark as a graph likes this makes it seem and there's an abundance of neighborhoods that are safer than neighborhoods in Europe (yes, even in metro areas).

2963,"You gotta remember that they had British and Portuguese police working on this, which makes things a lot more complicated than a single unit working a case. They also f*cked up the crime scene and were focused on a very limited number of people at the start of the investigation. The idea of a complete stranger/outsider being involved wasn't on the table, because they were convicted that the perp must have seen the McCann family before deciding to break into the appartment.

The police was very much focused on witness statements. Three statements were crucial: 

* The one by Jane Tanner. She saw a man carrying a bundle of cloths, what she assumed could have been a small child in a bodysuit. Police focussed on this witness statement and made it public in 2007 by pressure from the McCanns and UK prime minister Gordon Brown. 

* They had a prime suspect in a local British resident but couldn't find evidence. Then they found blood traces in Ms McCann's car and pursuited the ""parents did it"" theory. It wasn't until 2012 that they actually looked at the theory that an outsider/complete stranger might have done it.

* Martin Smith saw a man carrying a child. This statement was made public in 2013 asking the public for help, the man was identified as a tourist bringing his own kid to bed.

* A witness statement about two blonde men looking at the McCain appartment a day prior, talking in dutch or german. Statement also made public in 2013.

The investigators started working on the burglaries angle in 2012/13 and tried to identify the group of people responsible for burglaries in the area. In 2017 they publically said that they were closing in on those ones (which seems to mean that it wasnt easily available information).

I didn't participate, though I won't blame those who did due to their political beliefs - I will only disagree with it from a pandemic point of view, breaking the rules/recommendations about congregating and social distancing. No matter what people think about Sweden's way to combat the virus, it is actually a law about no more than 50 people being allowed to participate in organised events (which this was).

It's quite interesting actually, watching what is happening. The US might very well lose their regional hegemony which reaches out over Europe. But China (the contender) is likely too far purely geographically to take the spot. Hopefully in this vacuum a liberal Europe can to some degree become its own regional hegemony, though I doubt that that would be liked/accepted by (north) African and Arabic states, who might very well get sucked into it.

3010,"&gt; that doesn't mean that destroying or damaging an object can't ""cause sentimental damage"" if that makes any sense to you

Makes sense, I get it, I just disagree with it. Going there is kinda slippery, because you can't really define or measure things like feelings, honor, dignity and so on. There's a fine line to be walked here, but I believe that views and ideals are meant to be challenged and some things are impossible to change without radical action and without upsetting quite a lot of people. Never put aesthetics, tradition and respect for those long gone above respect for the living. That's just how I roll.

Still, something that can be powerwashed in 30 seconds is hardly damage - that's also my point. If they broke a hand or the head off then yeah, that would be not cool, but writing on it only damages feelings and you can't be responsible for the feelings of other people (obviously you have to consider how your acts will impact those around you, but sometimes there are more important things and you don't have control over who'll be pissed off).",Poland,/r/europe/comments/gvrinw/black_life_matter_on_statue_of_tadeusz_kosciuszko/fssu04m/,legrandguignol,1591225582

A gun is a weapon made for killing and they shouldn't be handed over like that. I trust more a guy previously evaluated with a bazooka than a person with a handgun of small caliber that they bought at walmart. Also note that when i referred to the small amount of handguns i was referring to Europe as a whole.

3079,"&gt;So the cold war never happened

Cold war is a concept. It is not an actual war, no actual war was fought that was different from todays geopolitics. It was mostly about showing who gets to the moon first or who spreads propaganda the most. For example, there is a poll about asking French people who did the biggest share of fighting Germany. The question was asked after WW2 and after the Cold war. After the war people said it was the Soviets, after Cold war it was the US. One great sign of propaganda that really doesn't lineup with the facts.

And no. Eastern Europe never got independent because of NATO or US. They did it themselves and it was mainly because Soviets fucked up at a certain point.

&gt;  think I already said that universal healthcare is a social policy.

Policies cannot be more capitalistic or more socialist?

&gt;It does seem that since voting to leave the EU all UK citizens have become much more relaxed about immigration generally. I guess they just wanted to control it.

Don't be facetious. Racists haven't gone away, they were empowered by the vote as it made them think their view is well supported.

Evidence shows those wanting to reduce migration are a significant portion of the UK (around 44%), that's not control, that's exactly what I said. 39% want the same level as before.

https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-of-concern/

On all that we agree in general lines, but important details differ. Probably thanks to our opposed views on EU. 

I'll try to ""explain them away"".

&gt; I am saying however that the Commission will not only try it, but they will use any agreement of using it now as a justification or reason to do it again. 
&gt; So I would consider it a valid counter-argument to saying yes now, that it only makes it more difficult to say no in the future. 

Yes, it will be more difficult to say no. But, if all goes well, why wouldn't one argue for keeping new status quo in 2028. Or even extend it! Just stinging your euroscepticism to show the difference between our views :P

But is that so unusual? Don't we always try to attribute results to our previous decisions and keep status quo if it is looking good? And, in the end, that is only an argument, and it will be up to ""EU 2028."" to evaluate it and make decisions.

You also see ""harder to say a future no"" as a valid argument for someone to refuse it now. Bit bizzare in my eyes, but I'll argue that on Austrian example. 

&gt; Or in another way, if Austria says now: No, I don't want to do any type of common lending or grants, because it will only give precedent to the Commission to try it again next MFF and it will be more difficult to stop it then (because there would be precedent). I consider that a very valid argument for Austria to say no to this proposal. Do you?

It can be an argument, perhaps on par with Commission's hypotetical argument above. But if that is the main/only Austrian argument, then I would consider it ludicrous.

3563,"I never said monopolizing is good. Your mis understanding. 

From what I've seen of the EU its not truly a single market. I cannot start one company and be able to compete and serve 500 million in the EU.

It's more of a group of separate markets based on country borders that is trying to compete with and work with each other.

In the USA it was similar to EU long ago, but through acquisitions companies grew to cover all 48 or 50 states. The cost of business decreases the larger your market grows or number of people you serve. By allowing our companies to expand and cover the entire US they can save administration costs and choose to invest that money into R&amp;D if they want. TESLA is a perfect example of this. SpaceX as well. Both expanding and growing while plowing that money into R&amp;D.

Bad examples are like Boeing that choose to spend billions savings on stock buybacks while their products fail. 

The ability to have your single product available to 330 million Americans immediately is what makes the US stronger and more innovative.

Is there a single EU food product that is sold in every country? I'd bet there is Oreos and Pringle sold in every, but those are American brands. 

Is there a single phone company that goes across multiple countries? Across the whole EU? Why not?

Even in military you refuse to come together or allow mergers across country borders. Each country builds their own navy, their own tanks, APCs etc.

Your rail systems aren't even standardized. Spain/Portugal use their own Guage. Central Europe uses the standard Guage. Eastern and southeastern Europe use either standard or Russian depending on countries. The result is you can't take a single train across the entire EU. Your train transportation companies can't even merge together to create larger markets so that they can develop and fix those. Since you don't have a single Guage  your heavy industries can't compete across EU. Lumber, steel, iron ore, grain,  all this stuff is cheapest moved by train, but you can't leave the limited zones that whatever area your heavy industry is in.

The fear of even a single merger between say a very large German company and a small company in Poland or Italy stifles that growth. This is the equivalent of Texas not allowing a California company to merge with a Texas company. As long as this continues you will always be outdone by China, USA, and anyone else that allows companies to compete and sell to all markets with ease.",,/r/europe/comments/gvdi59/spacexs_historic_launch_gives_europe_pause_for/fsqrtbe/,Bluestreak2005,1591189890

3571,"&gt;This just shows the economic ignorance of so many on this website.

I would rather say that you just showed that you fall on the Friedmann end of the spectrum, whereas I am Keynesian.

A 2k/month minimum wage is a reduction ad absurdum. But something in the region of 1-1.2k (this would take lots of deliberation) seems a lot more reasonable.

&gt; Also, you'd just have to fight inflation. 

Inflation already happened by the time you switched to the Euro. Just to take [cabbage as an example of basic good,](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/latvia/average-retail-price/average-retail-price-fresh-cabbage) the price was by 2017 (ca 50 cents) twice what it was in 2000. Whereas in France a cabbage costs 50-60 cents, but the minimum wage is 3 times that of Latvia.

Would some goods jump in price? probably a few. Would the people have more dispoable income at the end of the day? For sure.

Strong unions have helped the socially/culturally united scandinavian countries to reach high living standards, however the complexity in organising strong pan European unions is byzantine, between the petty ego contests and the language barriers.

Increases in productivity nowadays come from increased mechanisation/robotisation, which makes the location of the factories more important with regard to cost of transport and less to the salary.

Ultimately, I'm not the one being short changed, and it is east Europeans who are leaving money on the table for working a knocked down hourly wages.

3624,"&gt; Kroeger made 115bil in profits in 2017
Kroger made 1.97 bil in net income(profit) in 2017.
It made 115 bil in revenue.

To look at the most recent financials (not an accountant, correct me if I'm wrong), in billions:
 - 120. 846 is total revenue ~&gt; what clients paid
 - 94.489 of this is cost of revenue ~&gt; what kroger paid suppliers
 - the other 26.357 is gross profit ~&gt; what kroger took
 - of this, 21.340 is operating expenses ~&gt; what kroger paid their employees, including Admin, Sales, etc., rent, equipment, and so on
 - then we have 0.611 they owe in interest, 0.476 in income tax and 0.199 in other expenses (dunno)
 - 1.645 bil is what is going to Mr kroger's pocket (more likely a bunch of shareholders)

So out of $100 you spend there, $1. 36 is going to kroger's owners, which is a lot (more than I would have guessed) but not completely insane. This also means (again if I interpret this correctly as an untrained idiot on his phone) for the same $100, kroger's margin is $21. 81, and that really doesn't seem high.

As for Kroger abusing their monopoly position, I don't know enough about the US retail market to tell, but it does seem unlikely to me at first glance knowing they aren't even the largest retailer in the country.

3631,"&gt; They have the power to act, but they were not elected on the basis that they would act in this way, some were rather clear that they wouldn't.

But that's one of the reasons to elect representatives: so they can react to crises that could not be foreseen, and that don't leave time for an election cycle to get feedback first. An election is not signing a contract, it's giving a mandate.

&gt;In a political context they do not have a mandate (although they have the authority to act).

It's telling that I wrote the above sentence before I read this one of yours. Of course they are getting a mandate, that's the whole point. They're not subcontractors, they're representatives. We speak quite literally about ""getting a mandate from the voter"" after an election and ""*mandataris*"" to speak about elected representatives in general - people who are empowered to make decisions.

&gt;And again, the worrying thing with the EU in that context is that once something has been 'done' once it is in place, it is very, very hard for national electorates to hold their governments to account, the individual agreements can't be reversed, it becomes an all or nothing on membership.

That is not different when you live in a country either. I don't see the problem.

&gt;You can't push down the road toward federalism, with ever closer integration without the support of the people being governed, a lack of agreement is not an excuse to move forward, it is an indication that you probably shouldn't, it would suggest that your project lacks the consent you need.

3655,"&gt;here is also no need to storm castles if you can take the cities and countryside while people sit in the castle.

Only if your goal is some random looting. Mongols were trying to conquer stuff, and decentralized states combined with stone castles were too much for Mongols.

&gt;Spending time with a castle is just dumb in that case

Aaand those castles did make possible for Hungarians to rally and create sucessful resistance. In other words, castles were not stupid. If not those castles, Hungary and Poland would end up as tributary states. Because guess the other European nation, that lacked stone fortifications, and become tributary state for hundreds of years. 

And yeah, I familiarized myself with that post, and it was what my mocking was about. It's just a big pile of ""I guess Mongols just didn't want to conquer European stone castles"". What kind of reasoning is this? It's just a puny excuse, because people can bring themselves to admit any other reasoning other that some common myths - basically wishful thinking. If they didn't want to conquer European castles, and by that, conquer local kingdoms, then what was Mongol goal? To loot stuff? You told it (and so did I), Europe, and especially that part of Europe, was a shithole. And Mongold did know it become the invasion. There is no logical reason to believe that Mongols just tried to kill some Polish peasants for fun. They obviously came with conquest in mind, and as it turns out, they miscalculated horribly. They lacked capabilities to win easy war with Poland and Hungary, and what's worse, European armies ""outguned them"". You can hope only for so many tactical victories using unknown tactics and forces, Europeans quickly would become accustomed with them, and what next? They couldn't bring big force to Europe because of logistical reasons, they would start to lose pitched battles, and they could not take castles quickly enough. Also, they couldn't capture Estergrom castle, and notably they tried really hard to do that. I don't even want to start on countries west of Poland of Hungary, where density of castles was few magnitudes greater armies were better equipped and terrain would become unfavourable for Mongol armies.

&gt;The point is that stone castles are not magic and wasn't something even new for the mongols.

I wasn't claiming that.

&gt;But there is no reason to believe they didn't have the capabilities

The reason is, that they failed the first time they tried, and they had quite a bad record for next hundreds of wars and battles (with of course, totally not Mongols). That's like saying that there is no reason to believe they Polish army in '39 couldn't defeat German forces in '39.

As in my previous post I pointed out about different circumstances. It doesn't matter if Baghdad was richer, bigger, yadayada that Polish or Hungarian cities.

What we learn from ITER will be used in DEMO, who will be the first reactor to deliver grid power. Optimist say the building will start 2030, but I'd rather wager on 2035. Using European bureaucratic efficiency, it will be done in a stellar 10 years. Keep in mind that ITER would be finished building in 2016 according to the original timeline. So we're looking at 2050 for the first plasma or maybe fusion. 

Only after DEMO has proven itself, commercial parters will be building fusion reactors. I will be surprised if I see it in my lifetime. Anyway it will be too late to have an effect on climate change. By then we'll either have other non-polluting energy sources or we're royally fucked.

3679,"&gt; Still a large part was traded for coal and biomass is not a real renewable which also causes air pollution.

In the first year maybe yeah, Biomass was slightly increased by another 30% not even accounting for 8% of the increase in renewables. and Biomass is in fact a renewable energy with a very tiny carbon footprint. I think you don't understand how it works. It's not just burning trees. Most is actually biogas, which is fermented biomater that produces gasses and they can be burned or used as fuel for transportation.

&gt; Again, 5% of the world energy supply is an incredible amount.

5% is not nothing, but it's not a lot either. A power grid is not made to supply 100% of the consumption it's made to supply much more to prevent brownouts and blackouts. So these 5% on top don't really add a lot of benefit.

&gt;As for physicists migrating, you think that if you are a random country you can just say: ""hey I want to open up a nuclear power plant, please nuclear physicists, come work here""? I am not sure if there even is a country in the world that didn't get its nuclear physicists through domestic education.

Ok, first of all, nuclear physicists are not strictly necessary to operate a power plant. You can just sell your generator and train people in the country you are selling it to. Second, most countries do have secondary education and are able to educate their people towards physics and nuclear physics.

Check [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_in_the_nuclear_sector.). The manufacturers are mostly from the industrialized nations in Europe, the US and Asia, but the power plants are [all over the world.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_reactors#:~:text=All%20commercial%20nuclear%20reactors%20use,GW%20and%20118%20GW%2C%20respectively.) Do you also think you can buy toys only where toy engineers are educated?

This is becoming tedious though. You don't come up with any new arguments anymore, your tree burning fetish is totally misplaced and your lack of understanding of both world markets and biomass power plants is telling in your lack of understanding of the topic at hand. Keep to your opinion, It's totally fine to do so, there are decent arguments to root for nuclear, maybe someday in the future we will have it all figured out and it is the best option.

And to directly kill your argument at the first step:

16 of EU-27 had a positive government budget in 2019.

Greece was even better than Germany.

This isn't the first time people have rioted about this issue. It's a recurring problem and there have repeated week long protests when unjust deaths like the recent one happens. They've protested over and over to make a point, like you said, but nothing has changed. So you're saying for them to do the exact same thing they were doing before and expect them to make a point that will start a change when the situation hasn't changed a bit from when these protests happened before? These kinds of unjust deaths are becoming more frequent even after all the past protests before now, so what do you suggest they do? And after all that you say that ""the point has been made"". Under what logic do you say ""the point has been made""? I don't think your solution is justified here

That's apples and oranges, trade surplus means companies in country a sell to companies in country b, which gets the trade deficit. Government debt plays no part in that, the state budget in country b does not care about companies buying machine tools from country a on credit. 

Here's the thing, the trade surplus of Germany and the other surplus states is private property of private companies, not something the state gets to decide what to do with. This is not communism and we're not state owned corporations. 

Normally countries would just let this play out, as more money leaves country b their currency gets less worth which makes the imports from country a more expensive thus helping companies in country b compete. The Southern EU states do not have this option because the Euro is a one-size-fits-all currency. 

What you actually want is companies in Southern European states to get more competitive, more successful which means more turnover and profit, which means more taxes in Southern European states which means less need for debt.

Combined with reduction of meat consumption (especially lamb, beef and pork - in that order) you get a significant amount of points.

Regarding your point about jobs: there are many jobs that will have to replaced and some industries will need to transform (e.g. car manufacturers).

&gt;We‚Äôve only been experiencing anthropogenic climate change to this alarming degree since the Industrial Revolution. 

Meat wasn't nearly as widely available and consumed before its production was shifted to factory farms. The amount of livestock in the world is unprecedented. And EU (and many other countries) keeps subsidizing dairy and meat production....

If we really want to address the climate change, we simply can't ignore food and food production.

3977,"&gt; I thought wind was so feasible? Why did Germany need to opt for biomass to meet that 10% requirement?

Because burning wind mills in combustion engines isn't feasible? 

I think you got this wrong. **primary energy** is not just electricity. It is heating and transport as well. So the energy you need to move vehicles and trains for example. Most vehicles are still fossils fuel based. For these fuels (gasoline and diesel mostly) we substitute 10% with biofuels. 

&gt; Yes and Vattenfall agrees with you but everybody with a brain understands that it will lead to deforestation. If you want to believe that multi billion dollar companies do not have a trick up their sleeve to circumvent those anti deforestation requirements, be my guest, but I won't.  
 
That's an easy fix and its being done already. For every three you burn plant 1.01 new ones. There no deforestation. The hambacher Forst and villages around it are cut down for a stupid coal mine not to burn them for biomass.

&gt; You can already see the deforestation happening in many forests all over the world.

The absolute majority of that is for farm land though so we can feed our cattle cheap soy beans.

I don't want biomass to replace everything, I never said that. You are arguing in bad faith here. I said renewables are cheaper than nuclear and that's just a fact that even the nuclear industry has right. Just look at this [world nuclear industry report](https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/WNISR2019-Assesses-Climate-Change-and-the-Nuclear-Power-Option.html).

&gt; In other words, nuclear power is an option that is more expensive and slower to implement than alternatives and therefore is not effective in the effort to battle the climate emergency, rather it is counterproductive, as the funds are then not available for more effective options.

And 

&gt; The rather surprising outcome of the analyses is that even the extended operation of existing reactors is not climate effective as operating costs exceed the costs of competing energy efficiency and new renewable energy options and therefore durably block their implementation.

I am a physicist myself, and I wish there was a feasible way to use nuclear energy too. There just isn't. Not with our current reactors and not with the fabled new molten salt thorium reactors. In theory? All great sure but in practice with the challangening engineering around them, with the problems of waste disposal, with the massive risk to make huge areas unhabitable.

That doesn't make sense. What you need to correct the problem of intermittency of renewables is not a baseload, it's a backup.

Nuclear makes for a bad backup because the cost and the CO2 emissions are in the construction, not in the generation. So, once it's built, may as well use it to full capacity all the time.

And if you only have a baseload of nuclear like you suggest (20% of the total), then, what are you gonna do if there's no wind and sun on that moment where every single british family has its electric kettle on? Your 20% nuke won't be nearly enough.

Nuclear and renewables don't go well hand in hand. One should do either, but not both.

In fact, both have negative marginal cost, so to speak, in that stopping/slowing them down costs some money thus it can be financially more viable for the operator to *pay* the grid to accept the electricity.

Your main point (at least what I think your main point is) remains true though: nuke and renewables are direct competitors to one another. They cannibalise one another.

The cost of a solar setup with no subsidies is now way lower than it was previously, even with subsidies. All they were really doing is causing regular working folks to be subsidising the energy bills of the upper middle class home owners who had 6-7 grand sloshing around that they could spend on a solar setup.

Those folks can now still buy a similar (or likely better) solar setup for the same money, but without costing the taxpayer anything. That's a good thing in my book.

...same is largely true for EV subsidies. They only really help people who don't need help.

IMO EV subsidies should only be available to the elderly and disabled. Everyone else should be offered eBike subsidies instead. A ¬£3k EV subsidy can either help one wealthy person knock 10% off their brand new ¬£30k motor, or can more than halve the cost of an eBike for ten times as many regular folks.

4145,"&gt;You're missing the point. The problem is not the use of a facing on a structure, it is in fact used all the time in modern and even brutalist architecture. The problem with the Berlin Castle is that it's a pastiche. It's as authentic as a movie set. It's cosmetic surgery applied to a city. It's made to look like this building has always been here and no history has ever altered it in any way, which is a lie. A lie doubled by another lie: the building was never built that way in the first place.

I think it is you who are missing the point. Berlin Castle is not a ""building (that) has always been here and no history has ever altered it in any way, which is a lie"". It is a reconstruction. A reconstruction is a new building that recovers the vision of the old. The building can't ""lie"" and it is impossible to ""forge history"", unless you want to state that its proponents conspire to secretly erase all information from the archives and people's memories that it was once destroyed. In fact the opposite is true, the history of the building, its destruction and reconstruction is clearly evident and celebrated in it. Even if the proponents somehow did erase all memory, the building itself would prove the opposite, by employing a concrete core and some materials\solutions that mark its more contemporary creation date. And even if it didn't (if it would use exactly the same materials and techniques), it would still bear a mark of today, by lacking age marks of the old building. A reconstruction is not a denial of history - rather, to not reconstruct is to deny history - to imagine like hundreds of years of history and continuity is not there, and that something that was important to the city can be removed just like that, and tossed into the book that will not be read. No, by reconstructing we recover old history, and simultaneously build a new history.

&gt;In a few years, there will be no way for a bystander to tell if this is the original building or not. 

Implying, that a bystander could distinguish 19th Century Classicist\Renaissance Revival castle from the actual Renaissance structures. In any way, that is literally the point of Renaissance buildings, lest you have forgotten - to revive, bring back buildings of the Ancients.

&gt;Also, this will certainly mind fuck archaeologists in a few centuries or millenniums.

Of course not, what a ridiculous idea. History is collected and researched in a completely different way. Have you ever conducted a historical study of the building? I doubt it, because I did, and such a thought wouldn't ever cross my mind.

&gt;I could possibly see the interest if they choose to build exactly like the old one, with the same techniques and materials. And even that would pose a lot of problems and ethical questions. But the way they did it is just a cheap way to remake a postcard landscape.

What *ethical questions*? Should we sit in a sophistic puddle and self-flagellate, or should we do what pleases us? A titanic effort to break through the unwilling City administration and continuous disparaging efforts by the Architectural commission to bring the Schloss back was a history on its own. Now, as I said, the historical gap - the lack of Castle - has been partially removed. I'd rather have it perform a stately function (offices of Berlin's City administration for an instance), but well, all in good time.

&gt;There's not a lot of connection between the Berlin Castle and the Colosseum. But this picture is interesting, look to the right. In the 19th century the Colosseum was in need of restoration, especially stabilization work, look how they decided to do it: in red brick, rebuilding in the same style but only in a structural role. Not one span is too much, the restoration only has a supporting function. Yet, they didn't use stone to hide the birck. The history of the building is visible on its fa√ßade and the necessary work was done to preserve it. Clear, honest, respectful work.

While I do think that the Colosseum should remain as it is, as it has created a new identity as a ruin - a ruin cult is a negative, pointless dead end. The Romans never cared about ""honesty"" - they architecturally ""lied"" all the time - their entire culture is a ""pastiche"" of Ancient Greece, and subsequently so was the entirety of architecture until 1900s. Continuity of tradition always implied that you reuse old forms and reshape them to your needs, whatever these needs are. A pretentious idea that we suddenly are not allowed to do this - is an ethical poison - the one that tries to boost creativity by surgically removing it.",The other Galicia,/r/europe/comments/gvc418/newest_european_castle_in_stobnica_poland_is/fsp79w4/,Strydwolf,1591147752

These problems are not exclusive to Portugal, the child trafficking cases in the UK are the perfect example of this exact thing.

People protest about other countries issues instead of their own.

Also there have been numerous social problems in Venezuela and in Brasil, but I don't see any demonstrations of support in Europe, it might have something to do with the massive amounts of American media we are exposed to, and how much importance is given to the USA.

The problems that happen in less influencial contries seem to be less important than the ones happening in more influencial countries, which is a weird stance for people that are so committed to protesting about anything and everything.

All opposition is suppressed violently and using extreme methods and this is done often without shame as freedom of speech or other human rights are considered folley.

4418,"&gt; I prefer the tights to the very wide late 19th century trousers.

If you're talking about the ones with the bulges at the top of the legs, that's originally cavalry-wear called [jodhpurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodhpurs) that came into use for officers.  I understand that fabrics at the time weren't quite as good at stretching, so if you wanted to potentially both be standing and riding, you needed to put some space at the top for the pants to shift up.

&gt; Originally, jodhpurs were snug-fitting from just below the knee to the ankle, and were flared at the hip to allow ease for sitting in the saddle.

-

&gt;Jodhpurs are sometimes worn as fashion or occupational clothing, not only for riding. In popular culture, jodhpur-style breeches worn with tall boots became particularly associated with military officers, who wore uniforms based on riding apparel, often derived from the aristocratic cavalry tradition from which many nations historically drew their corps of top commanders, viz. the quartering of the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces and Secretary at War in the Horse Guards building and the derivation of the rank and title marshal from what was originally a title for the commander of cavalry.[7]
&gt;
&gt;Flared-hip breeches and tall boots formed part of the military uniform of army officers in Imperial Germany,[8] the Second Polish Republic, [9] Nazi Germany, and many Eastern Bloc countries, including the former USSR and East Germany.
&gt;
&gt;Jodphurs, or flared-hip breeches, also were adopted as the uniform for some forces of motorcycle police.
&gt;
&gt; The style came to be associated with authority figures in general and was copied by certain Hollywood movie directors in the United States.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/gv2e7x/president_mattarella_no_country_will_have_an/fsny8mo/,duisThias,1591124853

[Poland grew immensely in the 90s and by the time it joined the EU, it had already been unrecognizable from its late 80s/early 90s times. It was actually poorer than Ukraine in 1990. By 2003/2004 already, before it joined the European Union - much richer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/amhxki/a_tale_of_two_countries/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

As you can see further, Poland‚Äôs growth dynamic didn‚Äôt really change at all with the joining the EU. Even then, the major benefit of the EU was and remains the Schengen zone and the Single European Market.

The importance of EU funds is greatly exaggerated - their net yearly value doesnt make up even a sliver (0.9% afaik) of Poland‚Äôs yearly GDP. Germany‚Äôs part of European aid (1/3rd) makes up only 0.3% of Poland‚Äôs yearly GDP

All of net EU aid to Poland in total (‚Ç¨110 billion) over a period of almost 16 years (2004-2019) doesn‚Äôt amount to even 20% of Poland‚Äôs **yearly** gdp (2019 IMF projection for 2020 - over ‚Ç¨550 billion).",,/r/europe/comments/gv52da/thank_you_eu_with_european_community_funds_an/fsny9tn/,SirrGalehaut,1591124868

4426,"I think you dont understand various aspect of society.

1) there is zero link between the status of platform and freedom of speech. Reddit is a plateform. If i call for the rise of the white superior race, they will shut me down, like fucking immediately. Freedom of speech means that you are free to talk. Not that paper have the obligation to print your racist poster, not that facebook have obligations keep your fakenews up.

2) if a critical system of your country such as government communications relies on a FOREIGN company, you country is lead by incapable.

3) so i just check if a cell phone company can cut service and again, you are going to have a surprise. Article 5.1 of SFR say it can unilaterally cut you service in case of violations of legal infringement in matter of public order and moral. Page 4 if you want to check. So you see ... they can.

4) a publisher isn't what you think it is. It has nothing to do with moderation. A publisher is merely a company that will bring to market a product. Set the marketing, handle legal, contract, sales etc. It moderate what it doesnt wants to be associated with but that is it. The organ that censure is the state, not the publisher (unless they dont want to be associated with).
That is why kids cant see porn, that is censure by the age.

4427,"&gt; It is a rejection of liberal democracy in favour of an authoritarian regime which demands that all the nation is used to further the ultra-nationalist goals of the single-party. These goals are usually the expansion of the state or the 'purification' of the nation's race. All opposition is suppressed violently and using extreme methods and this is done often without shame as freedom of speech or other human rights are considered folley. The most important aspect of this is the extremity of the oppression as fascism is an extremist ideology and without the extremity of oppression it is not fascism.

Because you can't just rip factories and transplant them:

* the knowledge of the workers has been all but *lost* in Europe/US because those ppl got laid off and then went into pensions/other careers
* network effects of concentration (Shenzen is famous for that, google ""gongkai phone"")
* it's a *multi hundreds billion dollars* job, money that neither the industry nor the governments can cough up at a moment's notice, not after 'rona. Also, it needs years if not decades.
* environmental regulations and cheap energy: most things are simply outright illegal in Europe, extremely difficult to do while following code or too expensive

&gt;The slightly higher salaries of Eastern Europeans would be offset by Eastern Europe being soo fucking close to Western Europe, also making Europe kind not dependent on anyone.

The ""closeness"" isn't relevant for anything that can survive a couple months on a container ship, the per-container costs of a freighter ship are laughable.

&gt;But that is not gonna happen? Why?

""Globalists"", the only circles I hear that word is alt-right. A shame, given the rest of your comment does at least sound logical.

UN human rights panel alone has been overwhelmed by the reports, which they say they find credible, though there are many more institutions that reported the same:  [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-un/u-n-says-it-has-credible-reports-that-china-holds-million-uighurs-in-secret-camps-idUSKBN1KV1SU](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-un/u-n-says-it-has-credible-reports-that-china-holds-million-uighurs-in-secret-camps-idUSKBN1KV1SU) 

If you are still sceptical about it (as I was when I first heard of it), there have been some journalists who went undercover to Xinjiang (they are otherwise forbidden from going there), and have reported first-hand what they saw. Obviously, they couldn't infiltrate the camps themselves, but a combination of satellite images, videos of camps from the outside and conversations with the locals as well as ex-prisoners paints a pretty good picture. Here is documentary about the accounts of one of those brave reporters, Isobel Yeung (she is known for reporting first hand from dangerous situations like Syria, Libia, South Sudan, Crimea, Yemen, etc.): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7AYyUqrMuQ&amp;t=90s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7AYyUqrMuQ&amp;t=90s)",,/r/europe/comments/gv7bx1/china_must_close_its_reeducation_camps_for/fsnzj4o/,LiberalTechnocrat,1591125463

That means that all the parliamentarians that tended to be rightist already leaved 5s and they were also a consistent number, and consequently proves that most of m5s parlamentarians are leftist.

In august 2019 Salvini decided to end the mandate because Lega and 5 stars movement couldn't get along (euphemistically speaking) thinking that Mattarella would have dissolved the chambers and afterwards he would have had an election already won by him (the right coalition had more than 41% in the polls, and that is enough to have the majority), but he didn't and 5 stars formed a new government with the Democratic Party (keeping Giuseppe Conte as pm)

4841,"Why would that be negative? 

We don't want it to spread however, this is an error in your interpretation of the strategy. Ill share an earlier text I wrote, so you can get up to speed on the actual strategy: 
The swedish response is based on

   * The goal that the spread should be kept on a level low enough that the health-care can handle the cases on a long term basis. It is NOT based on ""not dangerous"", ""heard immunity"", ""killing old people is okay"" or anything ridiculous like that.

    * The idea that a population given enough knowledge of the situation will conform to the recommendations (don't read it as recommendations, read it as restrictions, the only difference is that it is not written in law), without being forced, since they realise the inherent value to society and themselves of conforming to it.

    * The belief that agencies and society during a crisis should act cautiously to change, and maintain as much of regular society behaviour as possible

    * The belief that directions should be given on a general level, allowing the individual organisations to adhere to them in a manner suitable for their situation. Since society is complex, not one solution will be effective for everyone.

    * The belief that it is better to give few, very efficient directions to the population, rather than trying to control every aspect of their lives. Which is why we have three basic recommendations: Staying at home if you feel sick, maintain distance, and maintain hygiene. These recommendations does not put you in false sense of security, like masks or gloves does, and it is quite easy to remember.

And read ""belief"" as ""scientifically based theories"" Besides, people are ""considered expandable"" in other aspects of society as well:

Car crashes

Soldiers

Smoking

Drinking

Violence

Regular Flu

It is ridiculous to believe that we should not allow any deaths at all from this, no matter the cost. It is also hypocrisy since people dying from even more easily preventable causes has not been an issue previously.

Taking height for possible negative outcomes and be watchful of them is not the same as believing that you have can implement a pre-made strategy of handling clusters just because it sounds good politically.

You won't stop the virus completly, just like the seasonal flu hasn't died out yet. We are too global (and were too global already during the Spanish Flu) for that to be possible. Or will you put up borders everywhere preventing people from coming in to your country forever? 

Stocking up and increasing hospital capacity is not preparing society, it is preparing for only those who get a case bad enough to be admitted to hospitals, which means that in the long run, you will have a similar spread behaviour as Sweden, and the same old people who would have died now, will die then instead, at a higher cost for society. 

Your final sentence is apparently false according to some answers I got from your country-fellows, you closed down restaurants and similar public places, instead of keeping them open on certain conditions. How are these entrepreneurs fairing now? Not sure what you imply with that you would like it to stay that way? That Sweden would affect you bad enough?

4957,"Oh, Berlin. What is Berlin? Berlin, as a city, brings nothing but shame to Germany on the international stage. When comparing Berlin with other European capitals such as London, Paris, Madrid and Amsterdam, any decent human‚Äôs face must blush in humiliation. Even small countries like Austria, Belgium or Switzerland have Vienna, Brussels and Zurich: presentable cities, complete with high standards of living. Germany gets punished with Berlin, capital of losers. In all the republic, Berlin is home to the largest number of arseholes by far. Deutsche Bahn, Bundestag, Air Berlin and Axel Springer are but a few examples of all the incompetent scum being kept here. Glorious times have long since passed, the city is face down in the dirt. Berliners are lazy sods to their very core. Traits that would, in any civilised culture, pass for nothing but laziness, rudeness, incompetence, dissocial personality disorder or idiocy, are taken by the Berliner and declared a way of life. That is why the Berliner harbours intense feelings of hatred for anyone who‚Äôs better than him in any way. Especially the all-around superior Southern Germany are a thorn in his side. He envies their success, and Munich makes the top on his list of hatred. That city is ‚Äì and has! ‚Äì everything that Berlin wants to be and have. Berliners take no interest in the fact that it is Munich that finances their dissolute lifestyle, in fact, they secretly believe that they have earned it. So instead of freeing themselves from their envious and resentful lethargy, instead of rolling up their sleeves and improve their city, they revel in their antisocial freeloading and praise their so-called global city. Culturally, Berliners are set up rather weakly, great works lie far back in history. Moreover, mispronouncing ‚Äúg‚Äù as ‚Äúj‚Äù is considered a great cultural feat. Advanced students have mastered ending each and every sentence with a ‚Äúwa?‚Äù. The city‚Äôs culinary performance is second-rate. Here, a sausage made from glued-together, meaty odds and ends adorned with ketchup and curry powder is sold as a culinary masterpiece. Hardly any reasonable person would consider a bratwurst with ketchup a recipe, let alone the holy grail of culinary arts. Yet, in their magnanimity, the rest of the republic lets the Berliner keep his delusion, not wanting to amplify his inferiority complex. Economically, Berlin is an utter disaster, even the late GDR stood on more solid ground. The local economy is based around alternative blogs, something-something-media and, if universities are to be believed, gender studies. Disregarding his own bankruptcy, the Berliner treats himself to prestigious projects like the city palace and the airport ‚Äì which, considering its inoperative nature, is likely an art installation. Moreover, the city houses all popular parties‚Äô headquarters, who refrain from using ‚Äútraitors‚Äù in their official names (Probably for marketing reasons). For the longest time, this ‚Äútown‚Äôs‚Äù ‚Äúmayor‚Äù, the jolly Wowibear, butchered anything he found left in a presentable state. Long story short: Berlin is Germany‚Äôs tiled coffee table. It is to Germany what Greece is to the European Union, and if it had open sewerage, it would be Germanys Romania. Berlin is a blemish, the abscess on the arse of the nation.

4999,"&gt;Twitter Inc. would be welcome to move to France should the social-media platform face an adverse operating environment in the U.S., French Junior Digital-Affairs Minister Cedric O said in an interview with Radio J on Sunday.

Huh, dude's surname is literally just ""O"" : [C√©dric O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9dric_O).

Regardless, I think anyone trying to court Twitter's business is to be viewed with great suspicion. Twitter is an information tool like no other and any political party which prostrates itself to it could be hugely advantaged in elections.

I really, really do not like the ways things are going with that platform. They have too much influence and too little accountability. I don't care if they're a private business and thus currently legally able to promote / delete / hide whatever speech they like - we should change laws to ensure political fair play and freedom of discussion.

I don't know how it is elsewhere in Europe but more and more politics is being discussed online and barely in person - I think because people are fearful of reprisal for saying the ""wrong"" thing.

This guy apparently also had a long history of abusing his position as a police man and being violent. 

What I don't understand is why so few people are demanding answers or accountability from the police chief, the mayor, governor, etc. All the power structure that allowed this man to keep his job after so many instances where he abused people and was needlessly violent.

5249,"I'm a bit serious even. I think you are really underestimating his willingness to do the out of ordinary. Underestimating the evilness.

It's obviously true that he is somewhat demented at this point. It's exactly what yo expect, dudes 73, overweight, and has lived a pretty sedentary lifestyle with probably there being some truth to the hamburger diet as well. You can partly see it in his vocabulary for example, if you listen to him when his like 40 it's quite a bit larger. And he wasn't exactly a genius before either. But is simply doesn't explain all of his actions.

Independently of whether he wants to be a president, he doesn't want to lose his fortune, or look at even possibility of jail time, so he really can't want to face liabilities for crimes his committed. These things are not just going to go completely away if his not elected, impeachments are not ordinary politics, and the stuff that has went on in New York is a big risk to him. He's clearly compromised himself to various directions. So he really does still need to win. Clearly he is going to try.

Right now he seems to be at something like -5 to -10 percent (so negative) approval rating according to the polls I checked. Although, a little bit more support in voting (and I'm aware it's extremely rigged by many various means). He needs to try to catch up that 5-10 %. It's true that his in trouble because it is actually quite lot. Clinton, Obama, even W.M.D. Bush were all significantly higher at this point, where as only the ones that didn't get elected like old Bush and Carter were below. So it's really a lot actually. But that's if you use traditional methods.

Well what are nontraditional methods and how can we show his fine using them? Well certainly most presidential campaigns have not really embraced pushing hate as the main public campaign, and never as hard as Trump. Most candidates haven't run as publicly on a platform of calling groups rapists and thieves and on the premise he can subjugate them to build stuff. Most campaigns have never pushed conspiracy theories to the same degree either. But for this he needs a platform, and his already sort of shown this once before, it may not be as effective. And definitely most campaigns haven't worked with foreign powers the same way either.

The Twitter drama relates to needing the platform. He's scared they'll take it away at a crucial point or to manage his visibility down. The whole thing actually started with him pushing further out violent messaging and conspiracies. Perhaps he sort of dared twitter to ban him there. Only ban ensures he can play the victim, instead of being managed to lower visibility. That doesn't necessarily mean he shouldn't be banned, but I think he literally pushed the conflict intentionally. His also been pushing even wayyy(!!) further out media outlets than fox news, namely ""one America news network"".

What do you interpret this move of bringing military troops to show of force? I really think a little bit of conflict might be in order right now. If he's not going to be elected as is by not doing something radical, I think hell try to intentionally push a conflict.",,/r/europe/comments/gumzpy/blacklivesmatter_protest_in_amsterdam_right_now/fsll2po/,censoredwebsite,1591069245

No not at all. Its an idea, and a component that make up human rights. They arent unique to the US.

Civil rights arent limited. what is confusing you is you are assuming civil rights are different than human rights. They arent.

Probably a lot easier to impose a tax if it doesn't involve a new treaty among EU members.

Actually, if the EU pulls this off but then wedges up on integration and can't get more taxation powers for a while, I wonder if it might wind up with things in a wonky state where it's advantageous to the EU to pass policy that favors large multinationals, because they're the ones that pay taxes.

5352,"*Strange, I don't see them out there burning businesses of black owners?*

Civil rights arent tied to citizenship. 

I think your problem is ignorance. 

*Civil and political rights are a class of rights that protect individuals' freedom from infringement by governments, social organizations, and private individuals. They ensure one's entitlement to participate in the civil and political life of the society and state without discrimination or repression.*

*Civil rights include the ensuring of peoples' physical and mental integrity, life, and safety; protection from discrimination on grounds such as race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, color, age, political affiliation, ethnicity, religion, and disability;[1][2][3] and individual rights such as privacy and the freedom of thought, speech, religion, press, assembly, and movement.*

*Political rights include natural justice (procedural fairness) in law, such as the rights of the accused, including the right to a fair trial; due process; the right to seek redress or a legal remedy; and rights of participation in civil society and politics such as freedom of association, the right to assemble, the right to petition, the right of self-defense, and the right to vote.*

*Civil and political rights form the original and main part of international human rights.[4] They comprise the first portion of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (with economic, social, and cultural rights comprising the second portion)*


Your confusion is your inability to understand that human rights are a series of rights, that include civil rights. Civil rights are probably the most important right of human rights. Arguable finding ways to limit civil rights based off citizenship is considered a violation of of them. 

This isnt a US issue. This is a philosophical issue that apply universally. You are the one who is ignorant of what is being discussed and thinking the idea changes from country to country when it doesnt. And the civil rights issues in the US are NOT tied to citizenship, it is the belief that nobody should suffer civil rights violations, including non-citizens. 

You have no clue what you are talking about and you keep stating you dont have civil rights, which means you dont have human rights. And I keep trying to tell you this, but you are so stuck on your misunderstanding now that you must die on this hill rather than just admit you made a mistake. 


So like I said you either have civil rights, and maybe have human rights, or you lack civil rights and do not have human rights. I am just going by what you said. 

That you lack civil rights whch are:

**ensuring of peoples' physical and mental integrity, life, and safety; protection from discrimination on grounds such as race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, color, age, political affiliation, ethnicity, religion, and disability;[1][2][3] and individual rights such as privacy and the freedom of thought, speech, religion, press, assembly, and movement.**

Non-citizens in the Us actually have civil rights.

I've never watched anything on his main channel though, so...*shrugs*.

On the secondary channel, he tends to read a book or a few books about military history and then talk about a topic that it covered in short segments.  Sometimes interviews people on other topics.  Some of the books he references were also ones that I'd read, particularly on the Pacific Theater in WW2, so I was interested in getting capsule summaries (and he also summarizes a lot of German-language stuff that I'd never read...my chances of personally reading some 1940s German publication on artillery doctrine or something are pretty much nil).  Emphasis is on being broad, not deep.

Trump says something seriously stupid everyday. As an American we dont even pay attention to it anymore. 4 weeks ago he told people to drink bleach. He tried to seize twitter like 3 days ago. You may find his statements interesting, but we dont. They are boring. At first they were amusing and we laughed at him. But when saying something really really stupid becomes a daily occurrence it starts to become uninteresting. 

As for re-election Trump is really unpopular right now. In the past he was able to distract people with new BS, but with corona he cant tweet it away. He is in real trouble. He tries to distract from it, and maybe for a day he is successful but after a few hours people are reminded of their bleak current reality and whatever dumb drama Trump created for a day no longer matters. 

The real interesting thing with Trump is he never wanted to be president. It was all  a publicity stunt, and he won. and he did so many blatantly illegal things he needs to remain president so he can obstruct investigation into the crimes he committed.

The adopted parliamentary motion ""Bisschop Leijten"" rejecting the ever closer union illustrates this. Bisschop is an MP for the extremely conservative and right-wing SGP, Leijten is an MP for the Socialist Party.

The following parties voted for the motion:SGP, SP, PvdD, 50PLUS, VVD, CDA, CU, PVV en FVD. At the time about 105 votes out of 150, a super majority from a group of parties with many differences amongst them.

See the full motion:
&gt;MOTION OF THE MEMBERS BISHOP AND LEIJTEN
Proposed 25 April 2019
The second chamber,
heard the deliberation,
noting that both Article 1 of the Treaty on European Union and the preamble to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union contain the phrase 'ever closer union' between the peoples of Europe;
whereas, partly on the basis of this phrase, European integration has continued to deepen, strengthen and accelerate, also as a result of the case-law of the European Court of Justice;
whereas many citizens within the European Union do not feel at home in an EU as an ever closer union among its peoples, as this may contribute to an unnecessary and undesirable curtailment of the sovereignty of Member States;
whereas the Scientific Council for Government Policy advocates greater scope for variation within the EU;
whereas, in the run-up to the Brexit referendum on 23 June 2016, the EU pledged that the United Kingdom would no longer have to participate in further political integration; whereas, finally, the President of the European Council, Mr Tusk, has also repeatedly called on the EU to abandon its utopian dreams of ever closer integration;
calls on the government to submit to the Council, as soon as possible, a draft revision of the Treaties with a view to deleting the phrase 'an ever closer union' from the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
kst-21501-20-1443 ISSN 0921 - 7371 's-Gravenhage 2019
and move on to the order of the day.

I don't really agree with the Economic freedom indexes, like for example ""tax burden"" as a measurement of a country being less free. Sure you pay more taxes but you have stuff like free healthcare and education. Are we less free just because we pay taxes to get those things? In a wild west, each man for himself context, sure, but when people are dying of cancer and can't pay their health bills, no one wants that kind of freedom anymore.

  
Also they have this indicator ""labor freedom"" where the US is green and France is red. So is this freedom the freedom to fire people without justification? Because employment in France is pretty protective of the worker compared to the US. I'm not sure whose ""freedom"" these indicators are measuring. The companies?

yes, he did. One of the moments that led to brexit, possibly the breakthrough moment, was in 2011, when the EU states decided that the Euro sovereign debt crisis needed to be addressed. Cameron blocked the EU deal that would've tackled the crisis, because there were no reassurances for the City of London and its ability to continue operating as smoothly as before in the EU market.

The situation was so bad and urgent that the the core EU countries circumvented his obstructionism by going for an intergovernmental treaty, leaving the UK sidelined and isolated.

5764,"&gt; Dutch views surrounding the EU are complex, yet simply put, it is mostly viewed as an important trading block. There is *very* little appetite for a federal EU and 'the ever closer union' has been rejected by parliament multiple times. 

Good point, and at this juncture the ever closer union is not what one should be even advocating. It's just how to survive the incoming economic crisis.

&gt;In the Dutch view countries should be strong enough to deal with economic recessions themselves, when they're not the prevailing view is that's primarily caused by their own economic and financial mismanagement. I.e. in this crisis the pandemic is not the cause, but the trigger. Transfer unions in this context are very unpopular.

They should. They aren't unfortunately. If this was the case the crisis of one country wouldn't impact another. Economies which deals in tourism and other sectors impacted and weakened by the pandemic. Global demand slumping, causing a surge in job loss, causing another panic and slump in global demand is how depressions stay. The Netherlands is reliant on foreign trade, a loss of customers is a loss in production and commerce.

That being said, we could go into the bit about cross-border economic crises, although an argument could be made for greater independence seeing the issues with trade connections from the virus.

The know-how and market that the country had acquired in 70 years was lost in a matter of days... And only a fraction of it was regained under Wizz Air. It was also a major setback for our aerospace industry and tourism.

Most of Mal√©v's crew are now working for foreign airlines, and Budapest has totally lost the hub status it used to have. Most of the airport development has been delayed by at least a decade. And the majority of the routes has been taken over by Ryanair, Wizzair and Lufthansa... And we were only told that ""this is how the market works, suckers!!"".

All our forests are the result of voluntary plantations (19 &amp; 20th century) or natural regrowing on abandoned farming lands. 

Its ok though, those forests can steel be beautifull and full of biodiversity, I don't won't to paternalize but I think it's important that people understand that the ""let the nature due its work"" often have really bad results in Europe. Our ecosystems aren't balanced anymore, if you let a forest on its own, you'd still have people wanting to go there for hiking (difficult if you don't ""lighten"" the tree density), practice quad or mountain bike. You'll have rampant urbanization and illegal waste dumping. All those activities are gonna influence on you're forest and degrade it, and you won't be able to do anything to change it.

We need a closer relationship with nature, but we need to work together. It's not ""bad angry tree harvesters"" between ""happy naive city people"", it's about finding a general consensus on what's best for the forest AND the population on a specific forest.

For 10 years now we have been searching to develop new relationship with local associations in order to work together and plan forest management together, but we struggle. For every militant ready to listen and cooperate with us, there is 5 of them that just want to impose their specific vision of forests to anyone, and especially to people that are working on those forests.",France,/r/europe/comments/gui49c/me_biking_by_the_massive_tree_trunk_piles_in_the/fsiudgj/,Ravius,1591017046
