Of course the situation is completely different, but I think it is important to see and understand all sides of every story.

For example (just hypothetical) if 99% of the world recognizes the sovereignty of a country, but only 1% does not, then you have a pretty good grounds to say that it is so. In a case it's more divided, let's say 40% say it is, 40% say it isn't, and 20% abstain from commenting anything about it, it's a much less clear picture.

1935: Changed its name to ""Spring and Flower celebrations"". (Also made again a national holiday but name change was weird.)

1977: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taksim_Square_massacre happened.

1981: May day was removed from being a holiday.

1989: A couple people died.

1996: 3 people died. Turned into a full on riot and since Taksim Square was already banned this was on Kadƒ±k√∂y, which also got a ban for a decade.

2008 the day was finally recognized again which became official like in 2010.

Since then it is mostly not allowed either. For one reason or another. Also ignoring bunch of the military times.

Turkey has been in Cyprus all those decades for two main reasons. One, to save and protect the lives of their fellow Turks (Turkish Cypriots). Two, to further their own geopolitical agenda in a conflict with Europe and Greece for control of the Eastern Mediterranean. The presence of Turkish troops on Cyprus fulfill these two raison d'etres, and any removal of troops from Cyprus would be a big mistake, one that Greece and Europe will join on to exploit the  recent show of Turkish weakness in the region.

Thus, even if Erdogan had the power to do so (probably not, considering that the military would protest and potentially replace him), it doesn't mean he should.

He was talking about residence visas not passports. They are not 100% percent the same, there are some ways a passport *could* help you that residence permits/visas do not. But the main reason investors look at either option is to travel and reside in any schengen agreement country and both options allow this *on a permanent basis.* Also some of the golden visa programs he mentioned also allow special tax privileges to investors not normally allowed to other residents in those jurisdictions, whereas the Cypriot investor program doesn't come with unique tax rules (not that Cyprus doesn't already have desirable tax law for all residents anyway).

426,"&gt;Past decisions of ICJ favors the continental country and gives the islands only 12 miles of territorial waters.

Well that's just BS. Find me 1 case where an island nation the size of Cyprus got only 12 nm territorial waters by the ICJ. You won't find any cause they don't exist. The Myanmar/Bangladesh case you refer to (or Turkey's favourite the ""Snake island"") is about tiny islands not even comparable to Cyprus. If you want to check comparable cases look at Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Canary Islands, Malta, Bahrein and the Baltic sea islands ([https://i.redd.it/11t0hj8m2jw61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/11t0hj8m2jw61.jpg)). If the Cyprus vs Turkey case goes to the ICJ there is no chance in hell Cyprus will get less than 80% of a full EEZ (and that's being generous to Turkey considering the Malta vs Libya case). Cyprus has even invited Turkey to take the case to ICJ but of course Turkey refuses.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Also Turkish argument gives Egypt&amp;Libya more EEZ than the Greek one. So you're trying to convince them for a position *against* their interests. Good luck with that.

Just think about how absurd is Turkey's view (e.g. Crete no EEZ, lol) that Egypt accepted the deal with Greece instead of Turkey's offer that gave them more EEZ. Turkey tried to pull the same shit with Israel over Cyprus and they also declined.

441,"&gt; Julian Assange: Double Rapist! (At Sexual crimes In sweden the Newspapers are only allowed to print the name of the Person charged after both sides have been heard - they were never allowed to do that. No charges against the newspaper)

Lie #1. There is no such prohibition for newspapers in Sweden.

&gt; When assange reached the police station the policeman that was supposed to interrogate him is sick. Noone else can be found. Not even the senior prosecutor could be reached. Although they managed to allow him to leave the country because he needed to make a presentation in the UK.

Lie #2. Assange was interrogated, as you can read on page 83 of the [investigation transcript](https://www.magasinetparagraf.se/wp-content/uploads/content/bilden/forundersokningen-avseende-assange/AssangeSexAllegations.pdf).

&gt; Europe wide warrant for Assange - he is accused of fleeing to the UK without making his statement to the rape case, even though he was allowed to leave.

Lie #3. As previously mentioned, he had made a statement - the European arrest warrant was simply issued because when the court ordered the suspect's arrest, he had already left the country.

&gt; At the same time the swedish goverment allows the CIA to kidnap and torture two swedish immigrants in sweden.

Lie #4. This case [actually happened in 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation_of_Ahmed_Agiza_and_Muhammad_al-Zery), which was nine years earlier. That is not ""at the same time"" under any reasonable definition of the word.

&gt; he offers to make his statement in the Embassy where he won't get jailed. Both countries decline. Or even a interrogation per video. (Both methods that were used regularly)

Lie #5. Such methods are not at all used regularly in Sweden.

&gt; 3 Years later, Assange is still trapped in the small Embassy, 7 years so far.

Which was entirely his own fault since he could have stepped out of the embassy at any point.

&gt; Assange loses his political shelter. Ecuador took it without any prosecution whatsoever. Ecuador gets shortly after a IWF credit.

Or you can look at another thing that happens at the same time, the arrest of Ola Bini, for some clues as to why Ecuador might suddenly not have liked WikiLeaks anymore.

&gt; 15 Minutes later Assange is sentenced to 9 Months isolation in London, but what law did he break?

The Bail Act, as he broke the conditions of his bail by hiding in an embassy.

&gt; All because he found some War Crimes from the US.

494,"&gt;we have to protect orphans from their loving and caring gay dads? oh no... better let them rot in an orphanage without parental love, right?

Atleast in our part of the world there are more couples who want to adopt children than children up for adoption, especially when it's younger children/babies.

Sure, there are exceptions, mainly older children or children with disabilities, children with a history of bad behavior, etc. Most children up for adoption aren't orphans either.

You are extremly misrepresenting the situation if you claim that either a gay couple will adopt them or they will ""rot in an orphanage"". In reality the choice usually is whether or not to give the child to a gay couple instead of a straight couple.

I might be downvoted for this, but honestly I believe that gay couples should not be treated equal to straight couples when it comes to adoption. There are various studies that found a correlation e.g by the lack of a father figure and increased rates of crime and violence.

You can't directly move the findings over to gay couples, but the reality is that we simply do not know yet whether or not there are any bad side effects of being adopted and raised by a gay couple.

The people advocating for gay adoption rights are usually not doing it to do the children a favor, but instead to do the gay people a favor. It's not about the children, it's about gay rights. Many social workers are left leaning, so I wouldn't be surprised if some of them would even favor a gay couple over a straight couple to appease their own helper syndrome.

I'm not against gay marriage at all, I am also not against gay adoption rights, but I personally believe that gay couples should be given a lower priority than straight couples, just how single parents are given a lower priority. Gay couples would probably fit in inbetween.

&gt;actually gay individuals are found in over 400 species in nature, so it's completely normal and natural

Yes, it is normal that not everyone is the same and that there are minorities and exceptions everywhere. The word normal though, per definition, implies that something is ""as usual"", and being gay is not ""as usual"". So while it is normal that there are gay people, being gay is not normal.

And that's okay. A lot of people believe ""normal = good"" and ""not normal = bad"" and so when they want to argue that being gay isn't bad, they argue that being gay is normal.

I think this not only false, but it also sends a wrong signal. I would argue being gay is not normal, but it's totally fine to not be normal in every regard. Wouldn't this also be a better message?

&gt;opposing gay marriage is just stupid and evil.

That's a little bit contradicting, isn't it? So are they opposing gay marriage because they are stupid or because they are evil? Evil implies bad intent, and intent implies knowledge of what you are doing, which contradicts the stupid aspect, which I would view as ""innocent but stupid"".

A lot of people on the left are immediately jumping into the conclusion that if someone disagrees with them, it must be because they are ""evil"". Even if there is a lack of good arguments, that doesn't make someone evil. Nobody is never wrong and being wrong is explicitly allowed in our democracy. My advice: If you want to convince those people that you and your ideology isn't evil, you should start by not making the same assumption about them. I may be wrong but I am sick of the circle of hate and I believe that we'd be better of being kind and trying to convince someone with arguments rather than with attacks, which just lead to more hate imo.

Yes, Germans are from Germany, the nation, the state, the country, this is litteraly what I'm saying.

No, alsatians do not speak german. They speak alsatian. The same way we say Dutch people speak Dutch. Litteraly no one says alsatians speak german. This is first time I'm hearing it.

979,"It will take time and money are not valid excuses *once* a society decides that it wants to do something - doing things is what we have the status apparatus for. 

We have gone through a lot of far costlier population-registry related changes in Cyprus in the last two decades because we decided that it was the right thing to do (recently, we began recognising widowers in addition to widows for pension purposes; a few years back we created a new type of familiar relationship called civil partnership that confers almost all rights and responsibilities of a civil marriage except joint custody, a while ago we recognised that the status of 'internally displaced person' can be recognised for children of women IDPs and not just of male IDPs, and at the turn of the millennium we decided that children of a Cypriot woman with a foreign father can become Cypriot citizens). 

Those legal changes did involve a lot of changes in documents and procedures and creation of new ones. But they were even costlier than just that, because they also created a number of new beneficiaries for pensions or IDP support schemes. 

In any case, until Poland wants to change their ID number scheme, there's hardly any cost. Poland doesn't recognise a third-gender to its citizens and as far as I can tell, it won't for a long time, so the existing scheme can be kept, and so are the templates for the current citizen IDs and passports.

All they are asked to do at the moment is to respect the documents of their partner countries when citizens of those partner countries take residence in Poland. That means adding a third tick box in the documents that require it (and it can be on a gradual at-first-use basis like Cyprus seems to do), and make sure that the residence card template can print the glyph 'X' on the plastic (or not print it at all). The cost for this is comparable to when civil servants had to go around changing the pre-printed ""19...."" part of the date to ""20..."" on application forms (although I remember that that took a couple of years, there was a lot of striking over the 19 and writing the ""20"" part by pen).",Vote Famagusta For Cyprus-Cypriotist Movement on 30/5,/r/europe/comments/n2egrh/poland_rejects_inclusion_of_third_gender_in_new/gwjksta/,agrammatic,1619879290

1096,"The latest poll I could find was in December 2020 with 52 % supporting conscription. Its popularity has been waning in recent years. My guess is because it‚Äôs sex-discriminatory (only males serve) and the increasing liberalization of Finland: conscription is seen more as a violation of one‚Äôs liberties than a responsibility one has for their country.

It pays poorly, ‚Ç¨5.20‚Äì‚Ç¨12.10 a day depending on length of service, 6, 9, or 12 months. You get free food and board, of course, plus travel expenses to and from the barracks on holidays (conscripts get most weekends off). If you have an apartment or dependents the state pays a soldier‚Äôs benefit so you can cover expenses.

If you don‚Äôt want to serve in the military there are options:

* If you object to killing but not the military, per se, you can do ‚Äúweaponless service‚Äù, e.g. as a medic or other support roles.
* Discharge for medical reasons. You can‚Äôt really bribe doctors here, but there are some conditions that are easier to fake than others.
* Civilian service. You serve 12 months in some public sector job.
* Refuse all service. You will be sentenced for 6 months, but these days the punishment will be house arrest with an ankle band.

After completing their service conscripts become reservists. Reservists are obligated to participate in refresher training if called up to 80‚Äì200 days depending on rank and service. Reservists exit the reserve upon turning 50 (common soldiers) or 60 (NCOs and officers).",Finland,/r/europe/comments/n1ueoc/bulgaria_is_now_on_russias_list_of_unfriendly/gwj8rtd/,Astafel,1619872266

1171,"I'm sorry, but that is bullshit.

Let me ask you a question. The main reason for slavery was economics. It's extremely profitable to have a work force for dirt cheap. What do you think happened on British plantations after slavery was abolished?

[Indian indenture system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_indenture_system). One and a half million Indians were transported as ""indentured labour"" around the world to replace the slaves. Technically this was not slavery as the British got these illiterate suckers to sign a piece of legal document.  They were transported to plantations, where they were treated barely better than slaves.

[Indentured labour from South Asia (1834-1917)](https://www.striking-women.org/module/map-major-south-asian-migration-flows/indentured-labour-south-asia-1834-1917)

1185,"&gt;That depends on the situation. Many countries have existed for so long that you would have to look back thousands of years to see that. In some cases, the government was formed more recently by overthrowing the previous government, and in that case the leaders of the revolution usually create the new government.

I meant in your hypothetical ""meritocracy"".

&gt;I don't see why it would. If anything, I think it would be the opposite.

Any government in a meritocracy is by definition ""the best"". Therefore, every successor, must be worse than the first, since ""the best"" are already in the first government.

&gt;The government before that would try to choose the most qualified people.

That's not an answer. Because the first government still needs to come from somewhere. Just saying: ""the previous one"" isn't going to work, because we just ask the same question one generation back.

&gt;I don't think that would be a problem. In democracy, the parties that are currently in power cannot make long-term plans, because other parties can undo their decisions if they win the next election. But in meritocracy, the government would work together to advance the country in the long term, instead of changing direction every few years.

 By having the previous boss appoint the next, you ensure that change doesn't happen, as far as is possible. Therefore, ensuring stagnation and close-mindedness.

On the other hand, a stable parliamentary democratic country has smooth transitions of ideas, ensures everyone is heard and provides continuity through its civil service and institutions, as well as coalitions and slow rotation of leadership. Additionally, parties do make long term plans, especially when they want to ensure continuous governance. Look at the SNP, or the CDU for example. Incompetent leaders can get voted out after all. Competent ones, like for example Merkel, will be reelected.

&gt;The leadership positions would not need to be lifelong.

It would. The best person is already the leader. Therefore nobody can replace him, as long as he is alive, since nobody is more qualified than him.

&gt;That also happens in democracy. No one has been able to come up with a system that eliminates the possibility of corruption.

You are right. However, a system that has no scrutiny and rests on what's effectively personal appointment, ensures both nepotism and corruption, far, far, far better than any democracy can ensure it.",,/r/europe/comments/n1k6rv/chinese_embassy_unwittingly_admits_taiwan_is/gwizwxe/,the_lonely_creeper,1619864923

""Whataboutism"" as the ""tu quoque"" fallacy is sometimes a legitimate point. If I said Russia is going something racist, and you attack it, and then I point out racism in the US as a defense, that could very well be to quoque. Here, I am saying that this discrimination against Russians is wrong, and I gave you a thought experiment: Imagine putting in ""Jews"" or ""Israelis"" instead of ""Russians."" Would that statement still be true? You would call it out as racist. I demand a justification for that discrimination. I am against that discrimination no matter where that discrimination happens: Russia, Germany, the US, Korea, I don't care. It is wrong no matter where it is. If Russia is doing something similar, I equally condemn the Russian actions. 

Tu quoque says ""this is hypocritical; therefore, you are wrong."" If an alcoholic says alcohol is bad and unhealthy, saying the alcoholic is wrong because they drink is tu quoque. If they argue that it is fine for a certain group of people to drink and others not, it is not tu quoque to point out inconsistencies and ask for justification for that position. That is completely rational. It is irrational to say their position is wrong because they are an alcoholic or because they drink.

Ironically, you then attack me for being Russian despite the fact that I am not, and you seem to border on tu quoque with the discrimination perpetrated by Russia. I won't immediately cal it that because your comments are too ague for me to be sure what the true intent there is, but it certainly sounds like that is the intent.

Races aren't real. Races are cultural inventions. At one point, Italians and the Irish were a ""different race."" Racism isn't about science. It is cultural. Defending your racism by defining race the way it is convenient for you doesn't make it any less racist.

1223,"How am I saying that one section overrules another? I don't agree that I''m doing that.

See here. Section 5.1 has  two parts that I'll highlight for you:

&gt;5.1 Initial Europe Doses. **AstraZeneca shall use its Best Reasonable Efforts** **to manufacture the Initial Europe Doses within the EU for distribution**, and to  deliver to the Distribution Hubs, following EU marketing authorization,  as set forth more full in section 7.1, approximately (I) 30 million to  40 million Doses by the end of 2020, (ii) 80 million to 100 million  doses in Q1 2021, and (iii) the remainder of the initial European Doses  by the end of Q2 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;5.1 Initial Europe Doses. **AstraZeneca shall use its Best Reasonable Efforts** to manufacture the Initial Europe Doses within the EU for distribution, and **to  deliver to the Distribution Hubs, following EU marketing authorization,  as set forth more full in section 7.1, approximately (I) 30 million to  40 million Doses by the end of 2020, (ii) 80 million to 100 million  doses in Q1 2021, and (iii) the remainder of the initial European Doses  by the end of Q2 2021.**

I understand why you read the first part the way you do, but it seems to me you and all the other AZ-supporters here completely ignore the second part. Regardless of Best Reasonable Efforts to produce the doses within the EU, AZ shall also use it's Best Reasonable Efforts to deliver the agreed upon amount of Doses (defined term, not by definition produced in the EU). It's crystal clear, but also commonly ignored in these vaccine threads.

This is supported, *not contradicted*, by 5.4, which sets out how AZ is to go about producing vaccines outside of the EU for both Initial Europe Doses, Additional Doses and Optional Doses:

&gt;5.4 Manufacturing Sites. **AstraZeneca** shall use it's Best Reasonable Efforts to manufacture the Vaccine at manufacturing sites located within the EU (which, for the purpose of this Section 5.4 only shall include the United Kingdom) and **may manufacture the Vaccine in non-EU facilities, if appropriate, to accelerate supply of the Vaccine in Europe**, provided, that AstraZeneca shall provide prior written notice of such non-EU manufacturing facilities to the Commission which shall include an explanation for such determination to use non-EU manufacturing facilities. If AstraZeneca is unable to deliver on it's intention to manufacture the Initial Europe Doses and/or Optional Doses under this Agreement in the EU, the Commission or the Participating Member States may present to AstraZeneca, CMOs within the EU capable of manufacturing the Vaccine Doses, and AstraZeneca shall use it's Best Reasonable Efforts to contract with such proposed CMOs to increase the availlable manufacturing capacity within the EU. **The manufacturing site planning is set out in Schedule A**.

I highlighted the important parts. Note that the section talks of Vaccine, which is a defined term that includes the Initial Europe Doses. In spite of being asked to use Best Reasonable Efforts to produce the Initial Europe Doses within the EU, AZ may, if appropriate, manufacture in non-EU facilities in order to accelerate the supply of Vaccine.

Also relevant to note that 5.4 directly refers to Schedule A, which again refers directly to Initial Europe Doses, as planned manufacturing sites. Not optional or permissible, but *planned*.

In short, to address my original questions to you:

The EU absolutely didn't ban EU money being spent to develop plants outside the EU.You haven't shown where that's the case, while I have shown where the contract clearly states that the UK plants are *planned manufacturing sites,* not optional sites that supply may be taken from.

The EU also very clearly requested that AZ produce within the EU, but crucially has allowed and made provisions in the contract for how AZ may produce outside the EU if necessary, as I have shown. Such an arrangement would not contradict 5.1, as long as Best Reasonable Efforts to produce in the EU was used before using capacity from outside the EU. It's plain as day and the claim that AZ isn't obligated to deliver doses to the EU if they're not produced within the EU doesn't have a leg to stand on.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/n0l7oy/eu_demands_immediate_access_to_ukmade_vaccines_in/gwirxrg/,Alcogel,1619857056

1225,"&gt;At least my generation aren't trying to erase and re-write history.

You were doing it yourself when you repeated colonialist propaganda about ""advanced"" Brits uplifting India, completely glossing over their role in spreading and entrenching the caste system.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_India#During_British_rule_(1857_to_1947)

*British society's own similarly rigid class system provided the British with a template for understanding Indian society and castes.[155] The British, coming from a society rigidly divided by class, attempted to equate India's castes with British social classes.[156][157] According to David Cannadine, Indian castes merged with the traditional British class system during the British Raj.*

*Colonial administrator Herbert Hope Risley, an exponent of race science, used the ratio of the width of a nose to its height to divide Indians into Aryan and Dravidian races, as well as seven castes.*

***The caste system became legally rigid during the Raj, when the British started to enumerate castes during their ten-year census and meticulously codified the system.[163][152] Between 1860 and 1920, the British formulated the caste system into their system of governance, granting administrative jobs and senior appointments only to the upper castes.***

***Nicholas Dirks has argued that Indian caste as we know it today is a ""modern phenomenon,""[c] as caste was ""fundamentally transformed by British colonial rule.""[d] According to Dirks, before colonial rule caste affiliation was quite loose and fluid, but colonial rule enforced caste affiliation rigorously, and constructed a much more strict hierarchy than existed previously, with some castes being criminalised and others being given preferential treatment.***",European Union,/r/europe/comments/n23cnh/uk_romania_send_covid_supplies_to_help_india/gwirz8d/,Canal_Volphied,1619857095

1402,"New Poland will be the exact term they will use. I am sure of it.

Currently the two main economical engines of the EU are France and Germany. Italy is one step away from becoming the third big economical engine. After that, Spain.

Each time a country closes the gap to becoming as developed as they can possibly be, there is one more powerful economic engine in the EU and one less country that needs help. So each time it will be faster and faster to develop the remaining economies (more money funnels into less countries).

Also consider that most of the European countries arent even poor, in global standards. They are poor compared to the top economies in the world.

I predict that, by the time Ukraine joins the EU, their economy will be the fastest growing out of all of the big countries in the history of the EU because of these reasons. Imagine France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland being net contributors heavily investing in Ukraine. They will fly fast.

1440,"Siena, a city in central Italy, in the Toscana (Tuscany) region. It lies about 48 km south of Florence. The city was important in history as a commercial and banking city until surpassed by Florence in the 13th‚Äì14th century.

The site of Siena was originally an Etruscan settlement that later became the Roman city of Sena Julia. This colony disappeared, but the new Siena that later developed flourished under the Lombard kings. In the 12th century it became a self-governing commune. Economic rivalry and territorial conflict with neighbouring Florence, which was anti-imperial, or Guelf, made Siena the centre of pro-imperial Ghibellinism in Tuscany. The Sienese reached the peak of political success on Sept. 4, 1260, when their army crushed the Florentines at the Battle of Montaperti.

Siena became an important banking centre in the 13th century but was unable to compete with its rival, Florence. The imperial cause declined, and the popes imposed economic sanctions against Siena‚Äôs Ghibelline merchants. Soon afterward, Siena itself turned Guelf, and the Ghibelline nobility lost its share of power. The city suffered from wars and famines and from the general economic decline that afflicted Italy in the early 14th century, and it was also devastated by outbreaks of the Black Death, which began in 1348. Struggles for power between factions of nobles, merchants, and the people replaced the strife between Guelfs and Ghibellines but did little to give Siena internal stability.

Despite these problems, the Sienese maintained an overall prosperity that enabled them to embellish their city with beautiful churches, palaces, towers, and fountains. In the decades of economic and moral depression following the Black Death, Siena entered an era of heightened religiosity, during which the city produced two renowned saints, Catherine and Bernardino. Siena retained its independence during the 15th century, but economic stagnation continued. In 1487 an exiled aristocrat, Pandolfo Petrucci, seized power and ruled with brutal tyranny through a period of French and Spanish invasions until his death in 1512. His regime was continued by his family until 1524. After a long and heroic defense, Siena surrendered to the Spaniards in 1555, and two years later Philip II of Spain ceded the city to Florence. In 1861 Siena, together with the rest of Tuscany, was absorbed into the new Kingdom of Italy.

**Because Siena‚Äôs building activity was largely suspended in the 16th century, and because most modern building has taken place outside the city walls, Siena‚Äôs original character remains unspoiled, and Siena remains essentially a medieval town. The walls and gates enclose a city centre that is composed of narrow, winding streets and old buildings and palaces.** The centre of the city is dominated by a large, shell-shaped square called the Piazza del Campo, which is the focus of Siena‚Äôs civic life. Tourists come to Siena in large numbers to view the Corsa del Palio, the famous horse races of medieval origin that are held twice annually on the Piazza del Campo amid colourful festivities. Standing alongside the square is the massive Public Palace (Palazzo Pubblico; 1297‚Äì1310), which is the seat of civil government. 

Siena was fortunate in escaping damage during World War II, and it now survives as a provincial town of great beauty and charm. It is also an archbishopric. The University of Siena was founded in 1240. The city has some light industry, but it is not on a major national highway or major rail route, although there is a road to Florence. Siena thrives on the visitors attracted by its artistic treasures and medieval monuments.",,/r/europe/comments/n2b46q/rooftops_of_siena_italy/gwic0v1/,Vucea,1619843578

The 4 years between 1945 and 1949 saw a brutal massacre that left tens of thousands dead. In addition, Chinese soldiers also looted Taiwanese households, raped women, robbed factories, etc. After the ROC (under the Chinese Nationalist Part, aka KMT) lost its civil war with the CCP,  they ""retreated"" to Taiwan and governed the island with a brutally authoritarian regime (murder, imprisonment, segregation, censorship, discrimination, destruction of local languages/cultures, restriction of native Taiwanese people's access to politics, public positions, teaching positions, etc.) for the next 5 decades, all the while claiming to be the rightful ruler of ""China,"" until the people of Taiwan forced their way to democracy. Taiwanese people have fought a long battle for freedom. There's no going back.

1807,"&gt;The guy is loaded and he's family costs 15 000 000‚Ç¨ anualy from pure tax money.

And the entire staffing of the castles is included in those 15 million euros, and believe or not we're still paying the least per capita for our monarchy... Denmark gives roughly 14 million euro but they're half the population, Norway gives their royal family roughly 50 million euro oh boy and Finlands presidency costs roughly 14 million euro too so because of our larger population we're paying far less per person. Cheapest out of all the fennoscandian countries per capita. Sure he has inherited a ton of shit like everyone else with a rich family really... Should we punish the Wallenberg family for that too? Kill the rich?

This argument that it costs us 15 million a year isnt a good argument because a presidency would cost pretty much the exact same unless you wanna start demolishing castles and our culture which is also paid by those same 15 million euro. Like we aint gonna go any lower really, especially because of inflation that price tag will continue to rise for eternity and that's just economics to be honest...

&gt;He rarley does anything publicly infront of the whole country. He might  visit some mine or do some speech or give out an award. Tbh he's pretty  anonymous and we don't know much about him as a person.

He holds several speeches a year, but you know... His primary job is pretty much diplomacy so that's what he's doing all day really. But he also engages in the Scouts, he is also engaged in technological cooperation with several countries. There's a page of his literal interest on the Royal Houses' webpage, and a biography on his entire fucking life... He's a public figure, he aint anonymous at all.

&gt;Sure he's a symbol for our country and has to keep up with that. But I  mean, what's the difference between that and just being famous? Famous  people is atleast not free from critisism and can be canceled. The king  and his family can't unless a revolution happens.

Just being famous doesnt mean you can be a figure head, a famous person doesnt have a job as a representative of their country while the monarch does. And the King is not free from criticism either, dunno if you just dont read news or what the hell you are doing but he sure has gotten criticism and we freedom of expression so any one is free to criticize him.

Cancel culture is fucking stupid really, dont see it as a positive thing being judged for something you did like 50 years ago. But then again he still is judged based on shit he did like 50 years ago any way so?

&gt;Let's also investigate his family and what he's done. His father was  litterarly a hardcore Nazi. Supported Hitler in 1939 and gave money to  him. His wife also has some nazi routes and has lived in sweden for 50  ish years and doesn't speak swedish.

His mother lived in Sweden for exactly 40 years actually. Of german descent, oh boy of course you'll support your country but then again I cant find any source for your claim there nor your claim that she didnt speak Swedish. [Searched for his father, says that he wasnt a nazi but okay...](https://www.svd.se/var-prins-gustaf-adolf-nazist)

&gt;and he also makes some political statements once in a while. He spoke out about our corona strategy and gangviolence.

Well he doesnt really take a political stance that is, he doesnt agree or disagree with party policies or politics. Him stating our corona strategy failed could be more of a factual statement seeing as we have 14 000 deaths, the rest of the nordics barely surpass what? 1500 peope? Yeah we fucking failed.

Him talking about gang violence was literally him saying that it also worries him just like it worries the public, and again said they just support the police and other government agencies work. Nothing really political, he wasnt taking a political stance or anything.

&gt;Having a royal family is the least democratic aspect of sweden and i  think we should spend our tax money on something else. But that won't  happen unless we have a revolution.

I mean it doesnt go against democracy really as he has no political power, a presidency/republic would cost us the same amount of money and would arguably weaken Sweden and polarize use further... So not a great option.

&gt;I also think your argument that he somehow makes our country politicaly  stable is plain dumb. Look at finland they are doing better than us.

Doing better than us how exactly? And would you attribute that thing to the president of Finland or rather the elected representatives? They literally had a party completely split in their parliament fucking over a ton of voters a few years back. Not great for stability.

What dumb headline is this?

&gt;Starbucks set to **force** 8 billion people to drink coffee
&gt;Today Starbucks announced a free cup of coffee for any customer walking into a store.

Just because you can, doesn't mean you will. And allowing something is not ""set to decimate"". Not every hunter, half being active, will drive to the turtledove region and camp out for weeks to get their quota filled.

I, however, come to this discussion from the standpoint of political philosophy, and really any value (real or perceived) that a royalty may bring is irrelevant when you consider the fact that the single most fundamental principle of hereditary royalty, initially elected or not, is the belief that *some people are fit to rule others simply by the virtue of them being born to a particular set of parents*.

When the UK loses access to certain activities that alone is a problem in its own right. When previously it was ""selling services to customers within the EU"" comfortably from the UK office and in the future to be able to sell that very same service to a customer within the EU means to having set up an office inside the EU, its a benefit for the continent. And while the EU may not be able to cut off everything, it can limit it in enough areas to gain something it previously did not had. That alone is a benefit. 

Being too innovative and playing with regulations seems also to be one of the key aspects which seem to prevent equivalence to the EU being granted. 

And while you are right, that the financial services to the EU are not the majority of total financial services, its still the largest single customer, making up 40% of the entire financial service business abroad. The fact that so far we havent seen the UK making any major steps in ""innovative"" and ""smart regulation"" seems to be due to that could risk preventing getting granted any equivalence for their largest market in that sector. 

I want to adress the goods vs services argument as well but before that: where do you get your numbers from?

1968,"But the thing about something being alive is that it can develop and mold into what fits the current world. The colosseum will always be a reminder of the romans slaves hardships, amongst other things, while the monarchy has developed away from being a system of pure hierarchy. I think any reasonable person can understand that it‚Äôs a give and take, and afaik few people envy their position. 

The Swedish monarchy at the very least can be compared with simply any other relatively famous and rich family, take for example the Kennedy‚Äôs. A Kennedy would undoubtedly receive benefits purely because their family‚Äôs political success in the past, both monetary and socially. The difference there is that at least the royal family has obligations towards the country in return for the fame they receive while many others just ride on their family‚Äôs coattails. So yes, it‚Äôs unequal but it‚Äôs far from limited to the monarchy. 

And you don‚Äôt really mention how people benefit from the monarchy.

I get it

But from a Finn's perceptive it's a bunch of bullshit. Cold war had nothing to do with our foreign policy with the Russians.
We were wiped out by those two wars and on top of that we were saddled with a huge debt we had to pay to the Soviets. Would've been nice to clear that some other way, but they are and will always be our biggest trade partner. Survival and rebuilding takes precedence and that relationship was paramount in that.

Kekkonen played his part in the optics of us being cool with the Soviets and he has been criticized for it, but at no point since the 20s and the threat of Finland adopting communism has there been some chummy feeling about Russians among us. 

And ""won't be on the list""?

My grandfather fought and killed Russians. We've mandatory military service, every male member of my family has served in the armed forces since the wars. We've a reserve force of 900k. All that is for one reason.

You really are dumb. :) Do you really think anyone who wanted to commit a crime would confess to it? But no, I dont break the law.

&gt; I'm just wondering why you feel what EU is doing as 'oppressive'... 

The law you linked should give you a good idea why. Theyre trying to force private companies to censor messages, companies that realistically cant have the manpower to do that.

And have you heard of the proposed backdoors in end to end encryption? Thats the same kind of stupid law. At first they tried to force it through using 'terrorism' as an excuse, that didnt work so now theyre trying the good old 'think of the children' excuse

&gt; Well, I guess you can get used to it eventually. 

Thats not something you can get used to, it just doesnt work. I know it makes little sense to you since you dont know anything about guns but many guns made for sport are simply useless. Besides whats the point of the lead ban anyway? It doesnt affect police and armed forces anyway and they use a lot more lead than civilians in most countries.

&gt; Naturally I never do that as well. That said, you're free to stun me if it ever came to that. I offer no resistance. 

If you or anyone else attacks me with a weapon, I will first and foremost do whatever I can to stay alive at all cost.

&gt; And yet that has not yet happened. 

That doesnt mean we shouldnt keep on our toes. If something involving video games happens, you can be sure they will try that.

But basically, Chinese government is quite meritocratic, if you don't achieve certain goals you can get fired or demoted and someone else takes your place, the politicians do serve the people and not private ends like in the US. Then there's the issue of representation, when asked citizens feel their government represents them more than in other countries. [Here's a poll where they ask if democracy is important and if they consider their country democratic.](https://archive.ph/GmAHT)

The number of parties a country has is irrelevant, parties are proxies for policies, the CCP has a wider range of policy making than many multiparty systems in the west, specially the US where 2 parties are 90% similar.

Here's a quote from a chinese born american educated capitalist:

&gt;Li: At the moment, the Chinese the party state has proven an extraordinary ability to change. I mean, I make the joke: ‚Äúin America you can change the political party, but you can‚Äôt change the policies. In China you cannot change the party, but you can change policies.‚Äù So, in the past 66 years, China has been run by one single party. Yet the political changes that have taken place in China in these past 66 years have been wider, and broader, and greater than probably any other major country in modern memory.

Because the party serves the people there's no need for more parties, the struggles and different factions are inside the party themselves (actually there are other smaller parties, but they are somewhat subordinated). Elsewhere parties have their private factions, usually representing a particular class, in US class however both serve the same class, the PMC and bourgeoisie.

It's the most archaic remnant of a bygone era of tyranny and colonialism in modern society.

It annoys me that our national news service becomes a royal instagram feed whenever one of their children farts or rides a bike. It annoys me that every new monarch baby becomes idolised by the nation for being born.

Of course it does. Monarchs are not simply ordinary citizens. Depending on the country they may not even be citizens at all. They are officials of the state, their property comes specifically from a claim of legitimacy that is inherently political and tied to the type of state. It is not simply property like any other, it is inextricably tied to the crown, which is tied to the constitution.

2465,"&gt;Exactly, and this is one reason why we only research stuff that has a  change of making a profit, while PUBLIC research carries the entire  sector of ""not profitable to research"".

But this isnt a problem. Private research focuses on anti - cancer results but by accident, we can develop great vaccinnes within months. Cance is a huge problem. I dont see a problem for profits except some edge cases like antibiotics.  


&gt;I don't understand what would change if those same scientist are paid by private or public. Why would it suddenly become boring?

Private companies are flexible and open to change things fast. They pay better boring work (in university people like to do what they like. Not trials for new medicine). Also office politics in university matters more. Thats why they dont like changes. New work and stuff isnt a thing in univesities.

2603,"Let me give you some examples with minimum wage which is approximately 283‚Ç¨. Price for 1kg meat is roughly 8‚Ç¨. If someone with minimum wage wanted to buy 1kg meat in order to prepare a dinner for their family 9 times in a month, the only meat price would cost 25% of his salary. And let them consider buying a car. Cheapest 2021 model car is by far Fiat Egea Sedan in here with 14700‚Ç¨ price tag on it which is domestic product. Their salary would buy them that car in 52 months if they wouldn't touch it. But here is the bigger problem: The actual price of that car is 8600‚Ç¨. The other 6100‚Ç¨ is the taxes. Yeah hyperinflation is dancing on our grave, price tags hurt when you go to the market but also government gives us the middle finger every year as increasing taxation. That increase is can be mainly seen on our electric, gas and water bills in our daily life but it's everywhere mostly in imported products and trust me we have everything imported from fridge to computer(btw cheapest computer is not reachable for minimum wage guy if he has a family). That minimum wage guy is giving 50‚Ç¨ monthly to bills at best when he doesn't need heating, 100‚Ç¨ to rent at best in a small and old apartment flat(owning a house is not an option for most). So he has only 133‚Ç¨ to live for a month with his family and he's surely not gonna buy meat with it. I guess it looks exaggerated but it's reality. Some people are just trying to take care of his family with long working hours and, despite that long hours of work, tons of credit card debts.

2655,"Every time I see ""underrated"" I get annoyed. Don't get me wrong, Slovenia indeed is beautiful, and considering the size, one of the most diverse countries of the continent. However, hardly anything is underrated in Europe in this day and age. Most of the countries have the number of tourists and attention they ""deserve"", considering their geo position and what and how much of it they have to offer. Slovenia has beautiful mountains, but other Alpine countries have many more km¬≤ of them. Slovenia has a beautiful but very short coastline. Their countryside is amazing but so is most of the Central Europe. 

Often people here see a beautiful pic of some Baltic capital and there are a lot of those ""underrated"" comments. Yeah those countries look nice.

What held back countries like Russia was not some god damn ""Shock Doctrine"", but delaying of reforms. The countries that reformed fastest also recovered fastest and had the best results.

3025,"This article doesn't seem to mention the main reason for the verdict:  
Germany has made a law to get CO2-neutral until the year 2050.  
But this law only made detailed steps until the year 2030, to get a reduction of 55% of the CO2 emissions.  
Since the heavy part of the law (a reduction from 45% to 0%) was left for the future governments, this law was ruled unconstitutional.  

The reason for this is ¬ß20a of our Basic Law (~Constitution):
&gt; [Protection of the natural foundations of life and animals]
&gt; 
&gt; Mindful also of its responsibility towards future generations, the state shall protect the natural foundations of life and animals by legislation and, in accordance with law and justice, by executive and judicial action, all within the framework of the constitutional order.

So, to prevent a situation, where a future government has to make really hard and unpopular laws to get our emissions down, they demand from our current government to expand this law to include all steps currently seen as necessary to reach the goal of beeing CO2 neutral in the year 2050,",Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg (Germany),/r/europe/comments/n12zof/german_climate_change_laws_are_insufficient_and/gwc9gg1/,Onioner,1619727382

Do they ? A quick google gave me this:

The distribution of income

The Nordic countries are among the most equal in terms of distribution of income.

"" Using the Gini coefficient measure of income inequality (where 1 represents complete inequality and 0 represents complete equality) OECD data gives the US a score of 0.39 and the UK a slightly more equal score of 0.35 ‚Äì both above the OECD average of 0.31.

It wasn't enthusiasm as much as it was ceausescu's terrorists (securitate) constantly firing at the military unit where ceausescu was being held in and literally murdering citizens in the streets for no reason.

3350,"&gt;She said the measures within the Northern¬†Ireland¬†protocol to limit checks on goods moving across the Irish Sea could be a model for how to reduce friction on a future border between Scotland and England.

&gt;‚ÄúIn terms of goods and services, if we are an independent country within the European Union, of course we have to comply with the rules and regulations,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut what we‚Äôve got to understand is that Brexit has created border issues, and our businesses right now are paying the price for that. What we‚Äôve got to decide is how best we arrange all of these things for maximum advantage.¬†

&gt;‚ÄúThe Northern Ireland protocol, if there are easements there, yes, I think that does offer some template, but we work in a proper planned way to make sure that any rules that have to be applied are applied in a way that absolutely minimises any practical difficulties for businesses trading across the England-Scotland border.

Isn't this causing massive issues in Northern Ireland? I swear I was reading headlines the other week about riots from loyalists regarding this issue? Pretty sure there is a contingent of loyalists in Scotland that could act in the same way?

The customs agreement between Ireland and the UK effectively draws a customs border in the Irish sea - Scotland and England share a land border, so surely some sort of physical barrier would need to be implemented to protect the integrity of both markets?

Although I do eat more vegetarian meals than before, I am not going to stop eating meat for the simple reason that I still prefer meals with meat.

3400,"I‚Äôve posted this before but it really needs to be understood by all what independence actually means for Scotland. It‚Äôs not like brexit. It is brexit times 1000. It is earth shatteringly apocalyptic for the Scottish economy.

Scotland has a **¬£15.1billion** (**‚Ç¨17.72billion**) annual deficit which is paid by England. [(Source)](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/union-dividend-of-1941-for-every-person-in-scotland)

This would need to either be replaced from another source such as the EU, which would put Scotland as a larger net receiver than Poland (‚Ç¨11.6billion) and Hungary (‚Ç¨5billion) combined, or the combined total net receipt of EU funding that Malta (‚Ç¨41million), Cyprus (‚Ç¨61million), Spain (‚Ç¨428million), Slovenia (‚Ç¨471million), Estonia (‚Ç¨516million), Croatia (‚Ç¨633million), Latvia (‚Ç¨935million), Bulgaria (‚Ç¨1.5billion), Slovakia (‚Ç¨1.6billion), Lithuania (‚Ç¨1.6billion), Luxembourg (‚Ç¨1.6billion), Czech Republic (‚Ç¨2.2billion), Belgium (‚Ç¨2.5billion), Romania (‚Ç¨3billion). [(source)](https://www.statista.com/chart/18794/net-contributors-to-eu-budget/)

Or, the newly independent Scotland would have to make huge cuts to all of its public services to try and cover that deficit. Considering the yearly fiscal transfer from England is larger than the entire Scottish health budget, these cuts would be absolutely, earth shatteringly devastating, and result in an incredible drop in GNI.


All of this data is based upon an assumption that Scotlands economy remains **exactly the same** as it is right now. That the process of independence will not impact that in any single way.

In reality, the majority of Scotlands economy is tied to the rUK, a lot of Scottish jobs exist as ancillary services to the U.K. Edinburgh‚Äôs financial district exists as a feeder and support to London. The UK Government is currently supporting more than 930,000 jobs in Scotland ‚Äì a third of the workforce, lots of coastal jobs exist in ship building etc directly as a result of the Royal Navy, even the SNPs claimed golden goose of North Sea Oil is a shady proposition, because the Islands which give them the North Sea Oil producing waters have stated they do not want to leave the U.K., and would declare independence from Scotland and remain with the U.K! 

Let‚Äôs not forget they would be unable to issue any government bonds to finance anything, and they would lack a viable currency as a country because the Bank of England has flat out stated they won‚Äôt get to keep the pound. 

Scotland is a rich country **now** because it is a part of the U.K., and gets a huge fiscal transfer every year from English tax payers, and a huge proportion of its jobs exist directly as a result of being in the United Kingdom.

It would not remain a rich country if it voted for independence. It would face a stark choice of either seeking some other large player to pay its bills (this is why the SNP is so loud about joining the EU, they need a sugar daddy) or it would have to make a level of cuts to every aspect of public services that has never been seen before in human history.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/n12jif/boss_of_scottish_banking_giant_we_would_move_hq/gwacuye/,ThunderousOrgasm,1619698467

3435,"What I said were rough estimates from what I read a month ago. Lookig at it more closely it looks more like 50% strict, 35% loosely and the rest are dumb or don't give a toss. 

It was an internet survey done by the nationnal health institute Sciensano you can find it on their website. It's about 70 pages long and I can't find an English version. Here is the most relevent info I found in the document. Survey was done in march 2021.

In Belgium the government asks that we limit our ""knuffelcontacts"" (close contacts) to 1 person. This is by far the hardest rule to follow and only 50% of those surveyed said they followed the rule. I also saw in the belgian press that the average belgian has 4-5 knuffelcontacts. 

 For the other rules non compliance is

1. keeping 1.5m distance : 40%
2.  practising basics hygiene : 25 %
3.  consulting doctor if you have symptoms : 22%
4.  Wear mask when keeping distance is not possible : 16 %
5. Take precautions with at risk groups : 15 %
6. Stay home if ill : 15 %
7. Limit contcts outside to 10 people : 11 %
8. Curfew : 8%
9. Wear mask when it is compulsory : 5%
10. No essential internationnal travel : &lt; 5 %


Reasons stated for not following the rules are

1. I'm still carefull so it's not a problem : 68%
2. Measures are too harsh : 48 %
3. Other reasons : 38 %
4. I'm not at risk : 35 %
5. I don't think the restrictions work: 29 %
6. Measures don't concern me : 20 %
7. I don't understand the measures :  20 %.

The document says compliance was lower in young people, men and in the French speaking part of the country (merci les antivax et Didier Raoult) 

The most shocking in my opinion in this :

""Lorsqu'il s' agit de limiter les contacts √©troits, 56% √† 67% des 18-49 ans le font, contre 37% √† 41% des plus de 50 ans""

3690,"- Data is skewed by the efficiency of infrastructures in each country - less congestion = less hours spent transporting, in theory more hours are then spent on production vs receiving parts/sending products.

- Data is also skewed based on the predominant type of industry in each country. 

E.g. Service/tertiary dominant economies are reliant on the levels of pay in other sectors being high enough that workers are able to afford to spend enough on service-based products to make that sector more viable.

Low/minimum wage positions in the service industry is not the most efficient way to employ labour, as it discourages staff retention which leads to excessive time spent training new staff and therefore makes the sector less efficient overall. 

Same with 'zero-hour' contracts and 'gig-economy' workers; it may be easier for employers to fire/rehire but it's not efficient use of time or labour costs and it's not in the long-term interests of the business, despite being a popular business tactic in the UK for example.",,/r/europe/comments/n0yhdv/productivity_per_hour_worked_in_euro/gw9wbsp/,Atomaholic,1619685036

Productivity is measured in average GDP per hour worked. This is not identical to the average hourly wage. Wages are only one part of GDP. GDP is calculated as follows: wages, salaries, and supplementary labour income + corporate profits + interest and miscellaneous investment income + farmers' incomes + income from non-farm unincorporated businesses + indirect taxes + depreciation - subsidies.

As for Germany it was not a question of if but when they got into war with Russia, regardless of their own stance. And since the russians had a manifacturing capacity magnitudes higher and since their military leadership was still in shambles, attacking sooner rather than later was the sound option. Considering only like 10% of the German resources went into the western front it's hard to argue that was a strategic mistake since it gave them a huge defensive advantage. Maybe you could argue that they could have convinced the UK to ignore their alliance with Poland as a means to crush communism but that's pretty doubtful.",,/r/europe/comments/n06sy6/on_this_day_in_1945_benito_mussolini_and_his/gw9goty/,lingonn,1619672190

Apparently it‚Äôs the same in Turkey.

Even if it was just one of those on a 4 acre lot they‚Äôd have to be pretty eccentric and risk-taking for a thing like that.

""This   Wednesday afternoon , the popular television personality Juan Joya   Borja, better known for 'El Risitas', died at the Virgen del Roc√≠o   Hospital in Seville .

'El Risitas'   had to be transferred this noon from the Hospital de la Caridad de   Sevilla (where he resided) to the Virgen del Roc√≠o University Hospital   in Seville, after a sudden relapse of his illness, where he died in   mid-afternoon, according to the sources consulted by ABC de Sevilla.

In   September 2020 ""El Risitas"" was admitted to the Hospital de la Caridad   in Seville, where he has resided ever since . At 65 and after  suffering  the amputation of a leg as a result of an illness, 'El  Risitas'  requested admission to the institution that was promoted by  the  Venerable Miguel Ma√±ara and manages the brotherhood of Santa  Caridad de  Sevilla.

The popular  Sevillian  actor and comedian rose to fame around the year 2000 by the  hand of  Jes√∫s Quintero with his appearances on the programs 'El  vagamundo' or  'Ratones coloraos', where he recounted his experiences  along with the  now-defunct 'El Pe√≠to'. His laughter, jokes, personality  and his famous  tagline of 'cu√±aooo' made him popular with the nickname  'El Risitas'.""",,/r/europe/comments/n0mict/famous_spanish_comedian_and_internet_meme_risitas/gw8mqb0/,sim-nao-talvez,1619656163

4039,"The bodies of Mussolini and others were brought to piazzale Loreto not by chance. On August 10th, 1944, in the same place, the security forces of the RSI shot 15 partisans who were randomly picked from a nearby prison in retaliation for an attack to some German truck that happened two days before, as ordered by the German command. They were killed at dawn, being August it was very hot, and soon their corpses were covered in flies as fascists prevented relatives from recovering them until sunset. Even more, they desecrated their bodies multiple times and forced passers-by to witness their actions. Later Mussolini is known of having said: ""We will pay dearly for the blood of piazzale Loreto""...

There is a side story to this episode. As soon as he learned about the massacre, [a partisan deacon](https://en.gariwo.net/righteous/the-righteous-biographies/holocaust/stories-reported-by-gariwo/giovanni-barbareschi-10268.html) urged the archbishop of Milan to go there and bless the bodies but his advisors told him it wasn't safe, so he ordered the deacon himself to do it, even if he wasn't a priest yet. So he went there and was able to somehow tidy up the bodies and search in their pockets for messages to their families before fascists drove him away. Then he blessed them and knelt down in prayer, when he stood up again saw that a large crowd behind him had also knelt. At the end of the war, when Mussolini and other fascists were hung downward in the same place, he went there and blessed their bodies.",Emilia-Romagna,/r/europe/comments/n06sy6/on_this_day_in_1945_benito_mussolini_and_his/gw8muip/,gerri_,1619656219

You do understand what Fascism is, correct?  

As an aside, the actual number of people killed for this simply doesn‚Äôt matter because the force  of compliance under duress only requires the perception of a potential harm.  Furthermore, the Nazis were actively engaged in fear based propaganda campaigns against their own citizens as well as a large portion of the world while simultaneously conducting one of the largest mass extermination campaigns in human history for the purpose of preserving their nation. They are fascists. They have no rights outside of the will of the state and NOTHING is permitted to go against the state. The mental state of both soldiers and citizens is fairly well documented and researched so it‚Äôs not a mystery either way.  Nazi dissidents were treated very harshly and had no due process, no rights, could have their citizenship revoked (this is essentially a death sentence in a fascist state) and in plenty of cases they were killed, tortured, had their families arrested and harmed, etc. This idea that this necessitates some kind of entirely unrelated evidence to be an accepted point in discussion is ridiculous.

For the opinion of the military officers that the invasion was utterly impractical, look to Colonel D. Belorusov, then the Chief of Staff of the Transbaikal Front, who participated in the meeting.


In this situation, one would need to prove the counter factual, that the soviets had a way to establish, hold, and expand a beach head. Given the practical logistics, and the soviets own opinion.

For example here in Belgium we have literal law artikels that specify when a clausule is illegal eventhough the usage of it should be legal in principle. And you can't always check these things because eventhough it was perfectly legal to use, a judge may rule now that in this case it's illegal.

4351,"&gt;I'd say something like ""not exactly a currently active enemy but we fought them or something so not a friend either"".
 

That's not too bad. I mean, if the Russian government really wanted to attack Finland, they would need to conduct a massive propaganda effort in order to convince the Russian public that Finland is a threat. Otherwise someone might consider it a waste of resources, because it would be costly. Our whole military strategy is based on the goal of making an invasion too expensive to be profitable. If it was cheap, they would already have done it. 


Fortunately we don't have any natural resources to speak of, the Russians already took them in the last war. And Finland is still not the easiest target, geographically speaking. And we do have a very unified population, trying to break the country apart from the inside would be extremely difficult.  


&gt;You're also definitely in luck that the vast, vast majority of Russians have no idea that Finland used to be part of the Russian Empire.

4354,"&gt;Where was this EE solidarity when Europe got flooded with refugees?

Yet again a topic where the EU did not reach a common stance. Germany just unilaterally decided to welcome all refugees and then claims others should do the same. Many instead proposed an Australian stance on illegal migration.

&gt;You just make a statement on how bad Erdogan is and thats your solidarity? 

You put your economic weight into the game and say unless Turkey stops violating the Greek border, its economic ties with the EU are at risk.

&gt; Lets just hope there wont be another Trump and that the US is not in conflict with China ... I am sure they will fight a two front war to safe you without their German bases and infrastructure. What can go wrong?! 

There are risks everywhere all the time. We have just decided there are less risks with the USA than Germany when it comes to defensive alliances.

&gt;I just dont get where all this entitlement comes from. Germany doesnt owe anything to any country.  

Where exactly have I ever claimed that Germany owes anyone anything? You see, you take these preconceived notions about a region and start applying it to all people from the region. I've never claimed anything like that and it's not my problem if somebody from Poland did. It's all in your head.

&gt;And I see absolutely no reason for your claim that Germany is ""unable and unwilling"" to aid her allies... this is just the typical bs.  

Germany doesn't want to respond to Russian and Turkish aggression strongly enough so that EU members would actually feel safe. [Germans would not support](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/PG_2020.02.09_NATO_0-08.png?resize=420,894) military aid to NATO allies in case of Russian invasion.

&gt;I am writing as a citizen and it is also acceptable to be fed up by the constant stream of criticism because Germany appearantly has to constantly act against its own interests for the sake of everybody else in Europe. 

This claim how responding to Russian aggression is somehow ""against German interests"" is such bullshit. How much trust would be in Europe where countries can invade and annex each other without consequences? We're not talking about some local feud here, but blatant violation of post-WWII order of the continent.

It's really hard to argue that he wasn't a socialist.  He was the editor of the Socialist paper, an official member of the party for 10 years, very well known in the party. 

His break with the party had nothing to do with socialist ideologies.  It was a political break because he supported a form of socialism that wasn't pacifist. 

You can make the argument that LATER, his ideology changed into Fascism, but his roots in socialism are all well documented, and if you read his articles from Avanti, we see many of the same language that modern socialists, and Marx repeated.

4552,"You make good points (about a military armistice not equating to a political surrendering) but Free France was indeed a government-in-exile recognized by the Allies. They used in a similar manner the ressources of the Empire (even though in the first weeks after the armistice it led to conflicts between British forces and ""neutral"" French forces, loyal to Vichy) over the course of the war. After Mers-El-Kebir, Britain stopped diplomatic inquiries with Vichy and supported Free France. It was more difficult for the rest of the Allies, as plenty of leaders were afraid of De Gaulle authoritarian and imperial tendencies. 

They were utterly defeated on land, and to think that France could have continue a direct fight with forces coming from the colonies seems like a stretch. The armistice (once again opposed by heavy weights in the military and political systems, like Reynaud, n¬∞2 of the French gov) only allowed France to keep its navy intact until the events at Toulon.

I'm an American, I'm not ""hating on America"" 

Was Saddam bad? Yeah to many people. did he keep that region in check and keep international terrorism from taking root in his country?

Yes, in fact he did, literally one of the biggest lies from the bush administration was that he was ""harboring al Queda"" a straight base emotional propaganda technique, the fact is that bin laden was an enemy of hussein's, who despised Islam and greatly discouraged and stamped out the proliferation of radical forms of the religion in his country. The [CIA received direct information](https://www.nti.org/gsn/article/cia-received-data-showing-no-bin-laden-hussein-link/) that this connection was not in fact real and was in reality the exact opposite.


Bush laid the groundwork for the last Republican administrations use of sensationalism and threat to manipulate it's base. 

Folks can either be adults and recognize this and realize that they're psyche is not dependent on it, or, as there are many many examples of still to this day just with this instance, completely try to revise reality in favor of a bruised ego and the idea that opposition absolutely cannot be right at any cost.

It is a claim that AZ failed to perform its delivery promises, in breach of an obligation to perform Best Reasonable Efforts (a legal term of art with a specific meaning, defined at length in the contract, whose interpretation can be the subject of much debate that could go either way). AZ will raise a defence that it did perform Best Reasonable Efforts, much legal argument about the meaning of the term will ensue. AZ will also raise a defence that it cannot be sued for failure to deliver, the Commission will reply with an argument that this exclusion clause is abusive and thus unenforceable (a very common argument in Belgian law). This will obviously not end with any impact on future deliveries but might entitle the Commission to some compensation for the delays.

4740,"""Domestic abuse was partially decriminalized in Russia in 2017, meaning that if a husband hits a wife for the first time, and she doesn't need to be hospitalized, it's an administrative rather than a criminal offense. If a report is made and evidence is provided, the abuser will only face a fine of between about $70 and $300.""

Also, the burden of collecting evidence is no longer on the police but on the victim, like in a civil case. 

Police are no longer required to investigate reports. They can, but they dont have to.

This legislation was passed due to lobbying by reactionary orthodox politicians.

Needless to say, domestic violence has exploded in Russia, and in some ways Russia today is worse for women than Saud.

""In 2018, the government statistics agency recorded a total of 8,300 women killed. That works out at 22 a day. Contrast that with the UK rate of one woman murdered every three days.""

And a few were from Swabia.  Thirty years later colonists from Swabia also moved into the region.

People using 'gray passports' want to do so because it grants them equally good access to both Russia and the EU. If they become EU citizens, Russia will start harassing them with visas and they might have relatives over the border they'd like to visit regularly.

4901,"[Yes](https://ember-climate.org/project/necp7/):

&gt;The EU Commission has identified the need for about 1500TWh of electricity production from wind and solar by 2030 to deliver their recommended emissions reduction of 55% vs. 1990. Recent modelling by Climact also arrived at a similar figure. To deliver this increase, annual deployment of wind and solar needs to be raised by a third (\~25TWh/y) vs. the current plans set out in the NECPs.

The targets are merely letting economics running their course. They are not pushing anywhere (except maybe slowing progress even down):

&gt;Across most of the countries in the world, either wind or solar is now the cheapest choice for electricity generation in terms of all-in costs. However, the NECPs indicate that many EU governments have failed to recognise the changing economics with wind and solar still playing a minor role in the electricity mix by 2030.

4987,"I generally believe in the 30 articles. The declaration of human rights.

Just because a state CAN kill does not mean it SHOULD be allowed to kill. No justice system is perfect, and given enough time you will inevitably kill someone innocent.

I also believe a state doesn't have intrinsic power. It only has as much power as its citizens allow it to have, the state will inevitably want more power over its citizens and the citizens want to be more independent. That's why I believe in democracy, it's a system to balance and keep in check the government and by extension the state. Personally, I don't want to give the government the power to decide who deserves the right to life, and who doesn't. I think everyone has those rights, just by nature of being human. In other words -&gt; I believe that the right to life, and the right to be alive are natural rights everyone has.

[To quote the UN:](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23862&amp;LangID=E)

*\[/quote\]*

**Universal Declaration of Human Rights at 70: 30 Articles on 30 Articles - Article 3**   


**Article 3: Right to Life**

The first six words of this short article are at the heart of global attempts to end the death penalty. If it enshrines the right to life, abolitionists argue, how can state-sponsored killing be justified? As South African Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu said, *‚Äúto take a life when a life has been lost is revenge, not justice.‚Äù*

Drafters of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) had fresh in their minds Nazi concentration camps and state-organized slaughter of millions simply because they were not the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù sort of person. Article 3 ‚Äì and closely related Articles 5 and 9 against torture and arbitrary arrest ‚Äì were a firm renunciation of Hitler‚Äôs belief in the supremacy of the state to control the lives of individuals.

Chilean drafter Hernan Santa Cruz explained that many of the UDHR‚Äôs Articles, are based on the belief that ""the interests of the individual \[come\] before those of the state and that the state should not be allowed to deprive the individual of his dignity and his basic rights.‚Äù¬†

**The right to life has gone on to be one of the core rights accepted by countries; 77 percent of the world‚Äôs constitutions include this right, compared to 27 percent of constitutions in effect in 1945, when the UN was founded.**¬†

Article 3 is about much more than the death penalty. **It is fundamental to enjoyment of all other rights**: after all, you have to be alive to exercise free speech, get married, or hold nationality.¬†

This was emphasized in a quasi-legal ‚Äúgeneral comment‚Äù document published in October 2018 by the Human Rights Committee, a body of independent experts that monitors implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, one of the two covenants that expand on the UDHR.

It noted that the obligation to protect, respect and ensure the right to life covers many other issues including modern technologies such as the use of drones in armed conflict. Looking to the future, it said environmental degradation, climate change and unsustainable development represent serious threats to the ability of present and future generations to enjoy the right to life.  


Others have argued that Article 3 embraces many other issues ‚Äì deprivation of health care that leads to death, extra-judicial killings, even the use of live ammunition by police forces against unarmed protestors.

Ant√¥nio Can√ßado Trinidade, then President of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights wrote that ‚Äúthe arbitrary deprivation of life is not limited to the illicit act of homicide; it extends itself to the deprivation of the right to live with dignity.‚Äù  


The right to life is amplified in four UN treaties whose stated purpose is to abolish the death penalty, and since 2007 the UN General Assembly has adopted five non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on executions as a step to eventual abolition. ‚ÄúThere is no place for the death penalty in the 21st century,‚Äù said former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

&gt;At least 39 executions have been carried out in the United States in face of compelling evidence of innocence or serious doubt about guilt.  
**- Center on Wrongful Convictions Northwestern University School of Law**

When the UDHR was adopted on 10 December 1948, only 14 countries had abolished the death penalty. Seventy years on, more than two-thirds of UN member states have either abolished it or no longer actually apply it. Even in countries that have a *mandatory* death penalty, it is not always enforced by executions. At the end of March 2016, for example, the deputy prime minister of Malaysia announced that 829 persons had been sentenced to death between 2010 and March 2016 but only 12 executions had taken place during this time.

Most nations that have abolished the use of the death penalty have cited human rights as a main motivator, while the steadily dwindling number of nations that retain the death penalty (88) or actually execute people (39), avoid framing capital punishment as a human rights issue.

Threats to life, however, come not only from state executioners, but sometimes from your neighbor or your partner, from criminal gangs and armed groups, and States have an obligation to protect their citizens.

Killings of women and girls ‚Äì by their partners, by strangers, by parents who prefer boys ‚Äì also constitute a particular grave and all-too-common abuse of this fundamental right, and females of all ages still often suffer inadequate legal and physical protection by state authorities and institutions. As Rashida Manjoo, former UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women put it: ‚ÄúWomen subjected to continuous violence are always on ‚Äòdeath row,‚Äô always in fear of execution.‚Äù

People really don't understand later Roman history at all. The Empire was in crisis at the time the Romans left Britain, and Honorius didn't have the power or authority to make centralised decisions like that as he was fighting wars of multiple fronts. There were three legions stationed in Britain which made it an important reserve of military manpower. These legions have previously lent their support to several revolts- such as Maxentius- and in 406 the usurper Constantine III declared himself Emperor in Britain before taking all three legions to restore order in Gaul, after the invasions of the Sueves, Vandals and Alans, something Honorius had proved himself incapable of doing.

5001,"They were manufactured during a time when the prevailing strategy meant there are ""hub"" airports and ""spoke"" airports. If you want to get somewhere far from a spoke, you go to the hub, and connect there. That meant a need for larger planes as more people would flock to certain areas for long distance flights. 

The rise and popularity of simpler, twin-engine planes capable of intercontinental travel meant that the hub-and-spoke model had to be scrapped, as companies could offer those same intercontinental flights from lower-density areas just by using the new, smaller long-range planes. That meant less need for these glorious beasts. 

Of course, that ain't the only reason, as this was an expensive machine for companies to own, and those smaller planes were cheaper, used fuel more efficiently, and allowed to have more origin points because of their smaller required runway length and parking space.

1. Is Finland directly paying 6.6 Billion into EU budget or is Finland only guaranteeing certain money for EU? Have you calculated what is the spillover effect of EU wide stimulus is on Finland?

2. So Euro is the problem for Finland but South-European nations are just shitting their economy? No, Spain has better record of growth in the last 5 years than Finland despite being in Euro.

5018,"Benito Mussolini (1883-1945) byname ""Il Duce"" (The Leader/The Duke in Italian), prime minister and ruler of Italy between 1922 and 1943, was the first of 20th-century Europe‚Äôs fascist dictators, and a direct inspiration for A. Hitler.

In order to ‚Äúpay back Hitler in his own coin,‚Äù as Mussolini openly admitted, he decided to attack Greece through Albania in 1940 without informing the Germans. The result was an extensive and ignominious defeat, and the Germans were forced unwillingly to extricate him from its consequences. 

The 1941 campaign to support the German invasion of the Soviet Union also failed disastrously and condemned thousands of ill-equipped Italian troops to a nightmarish winter retreat. Hitler had to come to his ally‚Äôs help once again in North Africa. After the Italian surrender in North Africa in 1943, the Germans began to take precautions against a likely Italian collapse. Mussolini had grossly exaggerated the extent of public support for his regime and for the war. When the Western Allies successfully invaded Sicily in July 1943, it was obvious that collapse was imminent.

For some time Italian Fascists and non-Fascists alike had been preparing Mussolini‚Äôs downfall. On July 24, at a meeting of the Fascist Grand Council‚Äîthe supreme constitutional authority of the state, which had not met once since the war began‚Äîan overwhelming majority passed a resolution that in effect dismissed Mussolini from office. Disregarding the vote as a matter of little concern and refusing to admit that his minions could harm him, Mussolini appeared at his office the next morning as though nothing had happened. That afternoon, however, he was arrested by royal command on the steps of the Villa Savoia after an audience with the king.

Imprisoned first on the island of Ponza, then on a remoter island off the coast of Sardinia, he was eventually transported to a hotel high on the Gran Sasso d‚ÄôItalia in the mountains of Abruzzi, from which his rescue by the Germans was deemed impossible. Nevertheless, by crash-landing gliders on the slopes behind the hotel, a team of German commandos led by Waffen-SS officer Otto Skorzeny on September 12, 1943, effected his escape by air to Munich.

As German defenses in Italy collapsed and the Allies advanced rapidly northward, the Italian Communists of the partisan leadership decided to execute Mussolini. Rejecting the advice of various advisers, including the elder of his two surviving sons‚Äîhis second son had been killed in the war‚ÄîMussolini refused to consider flying out of the country, and he made for the Valtellina, intending perhaps to make a final stand in the mountains; but only a handful of men could be found to follow him. 

He tried to cross the frontier disguised as a German soldier in a convoy of trucks retreating toward Innsbruck, in Austria. But he was recognized and, together with his mistress, Claretta Petacci, who had insisted on remaining with him to the end, he was shot and killed on April 28, 1945. Their bodies were hung, head downward, in the Piazza Loreto in Milan. Huge jubilant crowds celebrated the fall of the dictator and the end of the war.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/n06sy6/on_this_day_in_1945_benito_mussolini_and_his/gw4yfb5/,filosoful,1619584237

Funny how you instantly proceed to personal attacks the moment somebody challenges your opinion. 

&gt;Look at syria dumbass. they bombed the fuck out of their own country.

The Syrian war is a terrible example. It's got multiple internal and external parties involved, and religious extremists that could give half a shit about infrastructure. Most U.S soldiers share the same views as the militia groups, most are going to be against bombing their own people. They have the right to disobey unlawful orders. A lot of the fighting is going to be against the police. 


&gt;Also, as if a militia in the middle of alabama or georgia is going to be defending some important infastructure lmao, they will just be in the middle of the woods and it will be no issue to have it bombed. 

First, you brought up the town example why are you arguing with yourself? Second, that worked really well against the Vietnamese. Third, you're assuming the militia is going to be an organized military instead of a bunch of random groups carrying out attacks on government infastructure. 

&gt;Not sure what the video link is supposed to mean? All I see is a sane politician that 99% of the world would agree with?

5092,"&gt; Hell, if you combined data, Europe is astronomically more dangerous by gun violence than North America. 

True. 

&gt; The same goes for the US, with the difference that you are separating the data by location. 

This makes no sense within the context of ""present day"". You can't say ""well South Sudan is safe except for those areas where there's an active genocide going on"". 

&gt; Most of the US is very safe, and you would have to put intentional effort into finding the violent parts. 

Not true. Let's take Chicago, a city with a high crime rate in the US, but defintely not the highest. [Here are the homicide rates by neighborhood](https://blog.lucidrealty.com/wp-content/uploads/Chicago-murder-rate-by-community-area.jpg). They range from 0 to 157 per 100k. 

Now let's [look at London](https://www.met.police.uk/sd/stats-and-data/met/crime-data-dashboard/) in the past year, probably the most dangerous capital in the whole EU. The homicide rates range from 0 to 3.5 per 100k. 

So you have only a quarter of the neighborhoods in Chicago which would be considered lower than the highest homicide rate borough in London.

It's not that the some places are safe and some aren't. It's that your perception of ""safe"" is completely distorted to the point where you think that homicide rates of over 10/100k in half the neighborhoods and rates ranging from 30 to 157 per 100k in a quarter of the city is normal.

You said 2nd Gen african immigrants are not integrated, they don't like Portugal and say they are not Portuguese, I asked you if you knew any and you didn't reply (lol) so I gave you an example of me, which you ignored. 

You said 2nd Gen immigrants are less homophobic because they are younger than the average portuguese, but before that you said that you didn't want immigration because immigrants are homophobic. But then you said you can't compare 2nd gen immigrants with the average portuguese because the average Portuguese is older and older people are more homophobic, which I don't know if you noticed but implied the average white Portuguese is more homophobic than the 2nd Gen immigrants you so despise and which are ""taking over our country"". 

Then you said immigrants commit less crime because they are deported, except they are almost never deported here, so why would immigrants be afraid of something that rarely happens? They are not morons, they know these things better than you and I.

Now you switch over to saying that we have a higher immigration rate than the US. Which I couldn't find any source for. But even if it's true that's not the point of this conversation. The point started with you being against immigration because you are scared of homophobia. So yeah, keep your ideas, just know there's alot of proud Portuguese who are Africans. And there has been black portuguese for at least 500 years. Yes mate, there was black portuguese here in 1500, in Lisbon, they weren't treated that well back then, but that has changed quite a bit and will continue changing.

5254,"It‚Äôs too late - so I will not be looking links on proofs in English, but I will give you facts that you might verify yourself. I know this because I have a business in Estonian and spend a lot if time there.

So few years ago the speaker of Estonian parliament did the interview where he said that someday Estonia will get back those territories. Russia responded on it with military threats and military drills along the border and in Kaliningrad. Estonia just in case asked for NATO support and all NATO officials expressed support, but also they said something like - what the fuck? When you joined Nato you declared you have no territorial disputes - so why are you provoking Russia? And they responded something like the guy voiced his personal opinion and Russians are just being crazy.

Overall this treaty of Tartu is very important for Estonia because it essentially how Estonian state was born, also Estonian president last autumn attempted to de-escalate saying Estonia has no claims against Russia and this treaty is important symbolically because it‚Äôs inception of our independence.

Now statue story is really nothing. Those arrested where Estonian citizens - nit Russian. These people on the Estonian east are absolute mess, they always riot, demand something and their main business is smuggling between Russia and EU, so Russians don‚Äôt like them either. Another of their riots - is something nobody gives a flying fuck - and you definitely can‚Äôt compare it to military threats, show of force along the border and the fact that two states don‚Äôt have a peace treaty by this day.",,/r/europe/comments/mzk8mk/list_of_russias_unfriendly_countries_according_to/gw47zzo/,mm0nst3rr,1619569823

Again, this has no coverage. People are ashamed to talk. 

[This](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remaining_Documents_of_Talaat_Pasha) this book reveals the letters and documents of Talat Pasha about the deportation/relocation. He had take precautions about the deportation, I guess they were the best he can do in a collapsing empire. I don't have his mindset at the time but these people followed ""Ottomanism"" a unitary ideology until the balkan wars and they legislated Armenian reform plan just before the world war, Armenian interests were protected by a neutral internationaly selected inspectors. I don't think they did it because they hated the Armenians but I think they did it because they saw it as the only option. I have never gave a number to you before. Numbers are as clear as it can be at that time.

Call me a denier or anything you want, I don't give a fuck. I have no reason to protect the interests of a few death man. I have no reason to hate or dislike Armenians. I have no reason to take a side and say ""they deserved it"". No innocent deserves to die.

There's no clear reason why German minister of finance would somehow have to emphasise Russia's role in the world as some counterweight to the EU, on the same level as USA or China, unless they have specifically formed this image in their head.

I don't think it's a coincidence this is coming yet again from Germany, one of the most fervent Russia-appeasers in the West. Such small steps give way to only more and more fracturing of the EU's position on Russia, leaving the bloc ever more vulnerable.

So, if so many of us would us that much fission, what would we do when we run out uranium? At current consumption rates the conventional deposits are expected to last for 230 years or so. It covers like 10% of global electricity, so this can hardly be a global solution for a long period.

&gt;No, we can build them now, we have the technology, the only reason we  don't build more is because of incredible over-regulation, which makes  the process to get the green light for building a long and arduous process.

Construction alone is in the global perspective somewhere around a decade or so on average, if I am not mistaken. That can not be due to european regulations alone. Also, you suggest regulations should be lowered? Even the JRC that argued that nuclear power could be considered clean did so only under the condition that it adheres to proper regulations.

Political disagreement also exists inside countries, did you know? They manage to take decisions nonetheless.

&gt;I agree, but only if it's replaced by something better.

&gt;Only if the EU army is a serious player and nothing some weak passive thing. If they had tripwire forces and the willingness to use force to defend it's members. Not harsh letters, weak sanctions and bullshit like that.

The reason harsh letters and sanctions are a popular measure is because the EU competencies mainly are economic. It can't wield military power while it isn't allowed to have any.

&gt;It is a requirement if the military is actually going to be functional. There would have to be a unified foreign policy, command and so on.

Only in a dream scenario where all the European countries are in total agreement. And there will always be debate over what to fund and what not to fund. Stuff like jets and what not are really expensive and you don't want a mish mash of loads of different equipment.

&gt;That's a very strong reason to put a stop to being dependent on the USA then. All it takes is a competent Trump.

I agree, but only if it's replaced by something better.

&gt;As a smaller country your own army isn't going to be able to stand up to any serious invader capable of projecting force to your doorstep, so that leaves the option of an EU army.

Only if the EU army is a serious player and nothing some weak passive thing. If they had tripwire forces and the willingness to use force to defend it's members. Not harsh letters, weak sanctions and bullshit like that. 

&gt;Which is not in the EU at this point so that's just fine and complementary to an EU army.

Sure if an EU army was a proper thing.

&gt;It's not a requirement, it's an option that we simply don't have if we stay divided.

It is a requirement if the military is actually going to be functional. There would have to be a unified foreign policy, command and so on.

&gt;Sympathy towards NATO varies too.

Sure, but only a few NATO members are the ones that really matter due to it being based of individual armies instead of a unified army.

&gt;Different countries inevitably make different choices

To have a functional joint army you would have to cease being different countries and be way more unified.

&gt;Germany currently is more pacifist and reliant on NATO due to the taboo on military prowess in Germany, and for that same reason they are conflict-avoidant towards everyone, including Russia and Turkey. An EU army allows Germany to circumvent that taboo by the common defense aspect of it.

Or their pacifist stance and taboo on military prowess will be a poison that weakens the joint army from within and prevents it from getting serious backing or being able to take serious action.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/mz2p2t/germanys_greens_back_creation_of_european_army/gw1il0w/,zxcv1992,1619525746

I know that Estonia reformed the disability system a few years ago, which redefined a large number of disabled people. When before basically all people with disabilities were discarded from the unemployment numbers, after the reform many of the disabled people gained ""partial ability"", which by definition added them to the labor force and they moved into the ""unemployed"" bracket.

5924,"&gt; It's everyone's responsibility to keep themselves informed.

I agree but we have to deal with realities and the reality is that not everybody is capable or willing to do that.

&gt; You can surely take some time out of binge watching Netflix or hanging around clubs to keep yourself up to date on how the government works and of current affairs.

Are you saying that lower income people would be more informed if they weren't wasting all their time on Netflix and clubbing? Have you spent any time around lower income people? Really, I'm imagining you as some kind of Eton graduate right now, sorry to say.

We only have so many hours in the day and some people work long and hard and then come home to more work (children, housework). With the few remaining hours they might have, they deserve to take a break and enjoy themselves a little bit in life.

Sure, I totally agree that there is enough time to at least minimally inform themselves, but I also know it's not really likely to happen either. So, again, we need to deal with the realities.

I think a better solution is to try to improve the situation in other ways. One example is the Wahlomat  app in Germany. You answer a series of straightforward questions and then it ranks the parties most compatible with your answers, with additional background info and party manifestos available for those who want to read more. Basically, you make it easier and more digestible for people to get more information and to become better informed.

Simply cutting people off is unfair and could have some very bad consequences - better to keep trying new methods of educating people and hoping the result improves in this way, gradually over time.",Canadian / German,/r/europe/comments/mzi1wi/70_of_italians_believes_that_germany_has_met_its/gw190d1/,matttk,1619518752

 But winter war was pretty inevitable. Its roots starts from Finnish independence and Russians revolution with Lenin.

When Russia had its revolution 1917 Finland went to Lenin who, if I remember correctly, had just got the charge. Lenin gave Finland it's independence for two reasons. They didn't want to have a war with Finland at that time and they were thinking that they will take it back later. Which leads to ww2 and winter war when they thought it's time to take Finland back.

5972,"That's a really bizzare line of thought. Every country makes aims to do a lot of things. You probably shouldn't look at the U.S or many European countries aims from a decade ago and see how many projects that didn't take off. Many didn't even get beyond a headline yet alone a feasability study. Some of the Russian projects you are talking about actually happened for example Russia did build an SU 57 fighter jet and Armata tanks which are being delivered now.

There is no rush to go and build 1000's of them when we already have generation 4.5 equipment. We will instead phase out the Gen 4.5 equipment with the 5th generation in a phased format to ensure that the next iterations incorporate the most up to date tech and learnings from the v1 batch. You actually don't fully understand Russian military procurement process. We never order large batches of our military gear. Take a look at the SU family of fighter jets for example. The army always orders one generation as a batch, then order the next batch with upgrades",,/r/europe/comments/mzgqvj/russian_and_chinese_moon_base_project_has_early/gw19f98/,thekremlinbot,1619519106
