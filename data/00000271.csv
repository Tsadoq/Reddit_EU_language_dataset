So no source. I won't be continuing this line of discussion, it seems entirely a matter of fantasy.

&gt;no deal before the UK trigger article 50 was decided as the uncertanty was damaging the economy of the EU 

Negotiating citizens rights before A50 would decrease uncertainty. I don't know why you are trying to obscure why the EU would not negotiate before A50, it is clear as day that they did it to put pressure on the UK and give themselves a stronger negotiating position. Your attempt to spin it into some sort of moral thing is very strange.

&gt;as an EU citizens i'm very happy with how the EU has handled the negotiations and protected my interest.

That's fine. There isn't anything particularly objectionable about using citizens rights as bargaining chips and leverage, it's just extremely hypocritical to accuse the UK government of doing so, when they have done anything but and the EU has gone right into real politic mode. 

&gt;as an EU citizens i'm very happy with how the EU has handled the negotiations and protected my interest.

&gt;if you are unhappy about the negotiations you have your gov to blame, not the EU.

I'll blame the EU for playing hardball in what should have been a friendly negotiation, you can look out for your own interests without going out of your way to spite your supposed friends.

France would never want to relinquish control of its nukes. Each country has a domestic arms industry they would want to continue procuring arms and supplies from. 

From Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia's point of view the talk of an EU army is just that, talk. They think that if the EU ever actually did make an effort to establish any united EU command units then it would just be a half-assed effort that would duplicate things that NATO already does and waste the limited amount of money that other European countries are already spending on defense.

The idea is that their asylum isn't accepted yet, and so, like any tourist or other visitor they don't have a right to build up their life here, they just have the right to stay until the final decision is made. As for Duldung, it means they are specifically not allowed to stay here, but their deportation is postponed.

It is messed up and always has been, because in some cases the asylum paperwork takes a long time, and it *really* doesn't help integration if you disallow people from becoming a productive part of society, having daily contact and possibly friendships with locals, etc.

The general idea is to make living conditions shitty while still not openly breaking the constitution (which puts human dignity first).

I mean, that's all true, but I just refer to these people as uneducated morons, I don't think it's a fundamental human trait to behave this way, even though it's quite common. 

Instead of religion, music or painting classes (all of which can be made optional), all schools should have *mandatory* debate classes, from a young age. 

Teach people to both defend and attack the same position, have them look at things from different angles, to be critical. 

Then maybe when they grow up, they won't be fanatical consumers of product XYZ, or unthinking voters of ""their"" party, or they won't send death threats to person A who likes musician B better than C.

Everyone could be more rational, they'd still have biases, of course, but they'd be cognizant of them.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_Judaism

&gt; The Iron Age kingdoms of Israel (or Samaria) and Judah first appear in the 9th century BCE.[4][5] The two kingdoms shared Yahweh as their national god, for which reason their religion is commonly called Yahwism.[6][7] Neighbouring kingdoms of the time each had their own national gods: Chemosh was the god of Moab, Milcom the god of the Ammonites, Qaus the god of the Edomites, and so on, and in each kingdom the king was his god's viceroy on Earth.[6][7][8] The various national gods were more or less equal, reflecting the fact that kingdoms themselves were more or less equal, and within each kingdom a divine couple, made up of the national god and his consort – Yahweh and the goddess Asherah in Israel and Judah – headed a pantheon of lesser gods.

-

&gt; By the time this occurred, Yahweh had already been gradually absorbing the positive characteristics of the other gods and goddesses of the pantheon, a process of appropriation that was an essential step in the subsequent emergence of one of Judaism's most notable features, its uncompromising monotheism.[9] The people of ancient Israel and Judah, however, were not followers of Judaism: they were practitioners of a polytheistic culture worshiping multiple gods, concerned with fertility and local shrines and legends, and not with a written torah, elaborate laws governing ritual purity, or an exclusive covenant and national god.[12]",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7imasb/polands_incoming_prime_minister_my_dream_is_to/dr0hqc6/,vokegaf,1512858044

564,"&gt; And the saddest part is that these people don't really gain anything from voting these politicians, in fact they lose.

Careful with these statements, because it's not always necessarily true. Perhaps in Romania it is, but for example in Poland or Hungary, Orbán and PiS have made some steps that genuinely made the lives of their voters better.

You need to realize that when people struggle financially, they can hardly get by, they don't care about democratic standards and other nice-sounding things. They just want to be able to put food on the table and provide a secure future for their children without having to constantly stress over their expenses.

When Hungary was in deep shit and the IMF and the EU went there to order a strict austerity and plenty of other conditions for receiving a bail-out, Orbán just said no and he forced the banks (mostly owned by foreigners) to bear the main costs of the crisis. All those ordinary Hungarians who were unable to pay off their mortgages because they borrowed money in euros but in the meanwhile the euro-forint exchange rate changed, suddenly could start repaying their loans in forints. Why? Because Orbán forced the banks to change the currency in which the debts were denominated - and they had to do all this at a rate favourable to the debtors and cover the costs.

And how did he do that? Well he already had his people everywhere by then, in the courts, in the Central Bank, he held a super-majority in the Parliament, so he could have changed literaly any regulatory background, just short of total control over the institutions so that the EU didn't start infringements against him.

Of course he didn't do that just for the people. He did it to consolidate his own power, but he effectively improved the situations of many ordinary Hungarians. He essentially forced outsiders to bear the costs of the crisis, unlike in Southern European countries, where the general population bears the main costs of the crisis. 

So yes, while the Hungarians might have lost some of their rights, from their perspective, at least they didn't end up completely broke.

It's not always completely irrational to vote for guys like Orbán or Kaczynski, because in a way, they genuinely do attempt to improve the economic situations of their voter group.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/7ilvrx/assaults_on_the_judiciary_how_cee_governments_are/dr0bg6n/,kristynaZ,1512849983

I was banned from Worldnews due to this comment of mine - Islam can evolve it depends on whether the Muslims wish for it to evolve. Unfortunately there are too many Muslims that cannot accept Islam evolving because to them that would be ""corruption"" and in their belief is Islam is the only pure religion, unchanged and uncorrupted. That's why any Muslims that have more liberal views are seen as heretics. And often enough are threatened with death and violence. It may not be the religion itself that is the problem (although in my opinion it is). It may be the very people that follow it that need to evolve and stop threatening others because of their religious beliefs or lack of beliefs. The fact that as soon as a Muslim does something that is ""sinful"" in Islam for example being gay or having gay sex then they are condemned and regarded as non Muslim. And we all know non Muslims are considered inferior and lesser than Muslims in Islam. Which again is another flaw in the religion that promotes an ""us vs them"" mentality and some Muslims will take that as an excuse to consider everyone else as subhuman and inferior to them.

Btw if you don't include agnostics and atheists (23% of the population) non-christians religions accounts for 5% of the EU's population, so i'm not sure what diversity you're talking about here.

Or maybe you're saying that their opinions don't matter because religion is evil ?

To the point the country became ungovernable centrally because of some of the biggest landowners placing their personal wealth above the wellbeing of the country more and more as time went on.

Then there's Russia, which took exceedingly long to abolish serfdom, but it must be said the Czars were more often successful in seizing enough power momentum. The 'nobility' part obviously came crashing down when the soviets took power, but odd enough a new oligarchic power division soon replaced it, got even worse once the Soviet Union fell.

Another example is Hungary, which got conquered by the Ottomans for a large part due to betrayal of the king by much of the nobility. Before that only very strong kings could hold the nobility in line. 

There's also the fact in modern history how the oligarch behave themselves. It has many similarities with the nobility of old.

Excuse me? What planet do you reside on? According to that logic, Every single country on the planet that has a military is a war mongering aggressor.

Yes, France is rather intrusive when it comes to foreign affairs. But I fail to comprehend why you assume France being in a union with 27 other nations of whom the vast majority are extremely anti war, means that all the rest will follow suit? In fact, it will most likely be the opposite. With pesco, all missions and projects can only be undertaken by armies after a unanimous decision by all participating nation states. In that regard, France, a nation that occasionally fights wars, is heavily outnumbered by states that would never wish to be militarily involved in a conflict.

There is no such thing as 100% neutrality. It's just not feasible if you wish to have allies. We're about as neutral as one can be in our position, and nothing has changed our neutral status.

Anyway, you might not call it that way, and it might be even incorrect term, but you are.

At least in my opinion. Humans are limited, fundamentally, on a biological level, we can only understand so much and only see so much of the world. Sooner or later we have to start to take some things for granted and take them as ""axioms"" of our world.

Otherwise we wouldn't get anything done. And we would end up constantly rediscovering the old.

Now, as a result, when we build our value systems, we tend to generalize. It is inevitable, we just can't have nuanced view of everything, all the time.

And eventually, despite our best intentions, we will find something we put our ""faith"" in, without sufficient, or even any, reason. Consider our current values western liberal values.

716,"Some context:

Firstly, this ""Poland to rechristianise of Europe"" idea is not new. 

Let's go back to times shortly before Poland joined EU. A [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2003) was held on that question. Although it ultimately won with 77% approval, before that happened, results weren't so sure.

There was a lot of scaremongering action done by eurosceptics. These people are naturally conservative, religious, right wing leaning. The current government was left wing SLD (party consisting mostly of the younger generation of former communist party of Poland, in the long process of rebranding themselves as western style socialists). This government worked hard to make upcoming referendum succeed. Of course, other political forces, including many parties of Solitarity origins worked for that goal too, but they weren't in the government at that time. This work included negotiations with the Polish Catholic Church, in order to make it express support for voting for joining EU, despite its natural alignment with the eurosceptics.

The negotiations succeeded (at what price, is a separate topic). Church started actively supporting joining EU. Some of that support was made under ideological banners. This is when the ""rechristianisation of Europe"" was born. The message was like: ""Yeah, let's do join EU, so we'll have opportunity to rechristianise Europe"", or ""Poland will become beacon of Christianity for Europe"" and like that. Add a pinch of John Paul II quote mining, recollection of WW2, baptism of Poland in 996, etc.

Mind that, this ""rechristianisation"" was spoken in usual priest-speak: vague, mystical, metaphysical, alegorical bollocks they do like pros on daily basis. They haven't ever give any rational plan how physically this ""rechristianisation"" would be executed. From the perspective of today, the only real world effects I can think of, were:

- Poland has exported many of its priests to vacancies in parishes in Western Europe. 

- Polish migrant workers contributed increase of demand for local Catholic services.

Now back to Morawiecki.

This guy is taking over duties of Szydło. One of them is kissing ass of [Father Rydzyk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadeusz_Rydzyk), catholic-nationalist media mogul, who controls hard core electorate of PiS. This role is new for Morawiecki, but appearently he is quick learner. He appeared on Rydzyk owned TV Trwam, and said the words quoted in TFA. His mention of ""rechristianosation"" appears to me as reheating of 15 year old idea, in order to throw ultra-catholics a bone. But, who knows, he may be a religious nutjob too. Time will tell.

Go to romania. 

Teacher's pets that bribed for good grades or went for private lessons, doctors that ask for a bribe to make things easier, policeman that don't fuck up your life if you're related to so and so. Uni professors you have to wine and dine and give gifts at thesis defenses. 

Heck it used to be that if you bribed the train controller, you wouldn't even need to buy a train ticket.

&gt;As has been my assertion from the start, the UK offered a bilateral agreement to take citizens rights off the table before A50 was even activated. Certain member nations refused it.

what you are failing to understand is that EVERYTHING was off the table before triggering a50...as there was no table to start with.
the discussion could start only AFTER triggering article 50.

&gt;A purely made up limitation with no basis in law or procedure. They chose not to negotiate before A50 officially was declared as part of their negotiation strategy, their refusal to take citizens rights off the table as soon as possible is damning.

you really should document yourself...article 50 has been sign by the uk so the uk was ok with its rules...

This isn't about mismanagement dude. 

This is about students doing private lessons with their professors and suddenly getting better grades. 

Did you ever have in HS or Uni or whenever of your collegues taking private lessons with your professors? That's fucking nuts. Yet it's quite a common event in Romania for wealthy kids to bribe their way ""legally"".

This is about having to bring a few goodies to the doctor when you go to a check-up ... because that's what you do and they'll scowl if you don't. 

This is about slipping the police officer a bill to get off. 

This is about paying to ticket controller in the train some money so you don't pay the full ticket (which was extremely common in Romania, tons of people used to do it).

This is mundane corruption. Mundane corruption isn't some dodgy dealings ah very high levels that might be corruption, might simply be incompetence or ignorance (yeah turns out people sometimes do stupid shit without meaning it).

Why shouldn't it be? Even if it is unrealistic, the only way a ""United States of Europe"" could practically come into existence, and the only way its predecessors has historically come into existence, is through the consent of the governed in elections and referendums. The only way Christianization of European countries has historically ever come about is through the use of violence and forced indoctrination, such as the Crusades led by Poland in the Middle Ages and glorified by Polish right-wingers to this day.

Just like it would raise concern if a German Chancellor were to advocate the removal of Jews from the EU, it should raise concern when the prime minister a country historically associated with forced conversion and holy war is advocating ""re-Christianization"" of the EU.

854,"OK... I'm not really getting what your point is here, but let me try to figure it out. 

&gt; various countries, including your own, kept blocking us.

Alright, so you're trying to blame me for the fact that Romania isn't part of Schengen. 

**First of all**, it is ridiculous to hold an individual responsible for the actions of their country's government as though every single individual has identical political values that coincide perfectly with that of their government. 

**Second**, while Romania has the right to defend its political interests and this did not work out in its favour, other EU countries have that right as well. In this case, Germany is protecting its taxpayers from a strain on their social welfare system. Furthermore, the Netherlands, France, Finland, and Belgium all agreed with Germany's position, so these concerns were obviously well founded. 

Political corruption was also a cited reason. It is in the best interest of the EU to restrict members or potential members who exhibit political corruption. This also extends to other issues, including economic interests and human rights. Again, these EU countries have every right to act in their own best interest as well as that of the EU as a whole. 

**Third**, political pressure is an effective way to influence the behaviour of states. By restricting Romania on the basis of corruption, the Romanian government will be incentivized to limit corruption, especially if there is internal pressure to do so. Since Schengen would be an advantage for Romanian citizens, this political pressure does exist. Therefore, by pressuring the Romanian government, the EU is helping to reduce political corruption, which would be beneficial for not only the EU as a whole, but Romania itself as well. 

**Fourth**, one of the conditions for becoming a Schengen country is ""the ability to ensure the security of EU’s external borders"". Both Romania and Bulgaria (who was also involved) have acknowledged these conditions. Bulgaria even more so than Romania finds itself in a vulnerable position, especially given its shared border with Turkey. Romania also, albeit to a lesser extent, has such vulnerabilities as well in that it borders Bulgaria and several countries who have not met the criteria to join the EU, such as Ukraine and Moldova. This isn't their fault, but is important to take into consideration nonetheless. 

&gt; The EU parliament actually has always been in favor of Romania joining Schengen.

It did vote in favour of it last time, but it's not up to the EU parliament in the end, a system which Romania and other countries agree to adhere to. 

It is important that such agreements exist because they are liberal enough to allow for changes that will work in the best interest of EU member states, but rigorous enough to prevent any actions that would negatively affect a significant portion. This creates a system with as much inherent stability as possible. 

The EU parliament basically votes in favour of the general idea that X country is ""ready"", but after the vote is passed, it still needs to undergo several layers of analysis (namely through the Council of Ministers) to determine whether it is feasible and fulfills said requirements to a satisfactory degree. If it is not in the best interest of the EU as a whole, they have the right (and quite frankly the responsibility) to veto it. 

&gt; no one seems to care about Schengen anymore

Alright, so now we've gone from ""several EU countries cared enough to enact veto power"" to ""actually, nobody cares"". 

I think it's because of the practical implications of expanding Schengen that EU members *have* to care. Schengen's economics and political roots grow deeper by the day, and with each passing day, any changes to it become more and more impactful. 

There are some conflicting interests, that's true, but that happens in any form of politics: within intergovernmental organizations, countries, federal states/provinces, municipalities, and even just two individual people who need to decide on something together. 

Considering these conflicts, I would argue that it's remarkable that Schengen has overcome challenges as effectively as it has. In fact, the EU as a whole has been a lot more successful than anyone would have predicted when it was founded. The European Union is a historically unprecedented accomplishment, and it has problems that need to be ironed out, but principally and practically, acting in the best interests of the union as a whole was the right move. 

Any form of political organizations comes with compromise, and unfortunately it is impossible to act in everyone's best interest every time. In an ideal word, Romania would have been accepted, and I am very confident that this will happen in the coming years. Romania is on the right trajectory, it just needs a bit more time. 


So that's my take on each of your statements. Assuming you're willing to have a reasonable discussion without resorting to the blame game or making emotional, unsubstantiated statements, I would love to hear what you think of these points and whether you agree or not. 

I get that a lot of Romanians would benefit greatly from Schengen, and that a lot of people had high hopes for it, but at least try to see this from the perspective of other members.  ",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7hjhbz/what_do_you_know_about_romania/dqzv1kn/,snowflake25911,1512828121

&gt; How is making a (true) statement ...

Can we not run in circles please?

&gt; The deficit is larger nominally, but how big is it in relation to gross domestic product? 

Did Polish GDP grew 28% in 2016? Because the deficit did. 

And yes, such sharp increases [did happen in the past](http://www.bezpartyjni.podlasie.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/deficyt1990-2017.png). But nobody at that time made propaganda about ""budget surplus"".

Additionally, [this is how](https://twitter.com/Tomek_B999/status/926846563409940480) our ""budged surplus"" looks in comparison with other EU countries. 

&gt; There is no such thing as a free dinner.

Tell it to Morawiecki, not me. You are making now arguments, that increasing deficit isn't always wrong. But PiS celebrated the opposite, a decrease of deficit. Fake afterall, but that's the impression they tried to acheve.

Finally:

The government owned media TV, just yesterday, have shown how moot your defenses are. When TVP news covered the topic of new PM, they explicitly praised Morawiecki for ""having created budget surplus"". No nuances, like in the articles you linked. Just blunt propaganda. **The hoax is real and alive**.

The US airforce proposed a system with 6 meter long tungsten cylinders with a diameter of 0.3 meters impacting at a speech of mach 10; which would hit with a kinetic force equivalent to about 11-12 tons of TNT. Far below most nukes, but *slightly* bigger than a MOAB (largest non-nuclear ordnance in existence). It IS bigger however than the smallest tactical nuke created (but that one is absurdly small).

So yeah, there isn't really a lot of use in deploying orbital kinetic bombardment platforms at present. Not unless you think that your missiles won't manage to make it to their target.

That is what the media said when the UK wouldn't **unilaterally** guarantee the rights of EU citizens in the UK. You should read what actions are actually being taken rather than the sensationalist and partisan headlines.

The UK offered an agreement to guarantee the rights of EU citizens in the UK, in return for a guarantee of the rights of UK citizens in their respective EU countries, a bilateral agreement. This was not accepted by the EU.

That is the EU making citizens bargaining chips, not the UK. The UK wanted citizens rights sorted, guaranteed and done with before the negotiations even began in proper, it is *certain* EU countries that wanted to keep citizens rights on the table to be used as leverage.

1045,"Hm, sadly the resolution makes it pretty hard to read some of the things, especially since there are still a lot of Kanji I don't know, but I'm going to try to translate what I can:

* the beer mug and the bottle in Southern Germany say ビール (beer) and ミュンヘン (München - Munich) respectively
* the statue in Eastern Germany says ビスマーク (Bismarck), right next to the statue it says ベルリン (Berlin), on the bottom of the statue it says ドレスデン (Dresden, this one took me a while since it was written from right to left and in modern Japanese that is unusual for horizontally written text), next to the arm of the statue it says ハンブルグ (Hamburg) 
* the Kanji next to the books with the skull are 独逸, read (and today more usually written) as ドイツ (doitsu, from Dutch duits, referring to Germany)
* Under the soldiers in Western Germany it says ルール占領 (The Occupation of the Ruhr from 1923-1925 - I'm not sure about the last Kanji since I can't really make it out, so I just used the Kanji that is used today and hope that didn't change), the soldier in the back carries a flag that seems to say フィンランド (Finland?? I don't know why it would say that, any corrections are welcome) and some Kanji I can't make out.
* エストニア (Estonia), ラトビア (Latvia) and リスアニア (Lithuania) are where you would expect them and Latvia even has リガ (Riga) marked.
* to the west of Lithuania it says ケニヒスベルグ (Königsberg), which is the German name of what today is called Kaliningrad

This is getting harder than I thought, so I'm going to pause here and probably going to edit this post to add more later. Sorry if this ended up a little centred on Germany, but I started out with the things that were easiest to tranlsate for me - additions and corrections are absolutely welcome, though.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7il3vp/japanese_map_of_europe_from_1924/dqzpvlq/,phasic91,1512814546

1085,"- Unemployment will keep raising in the next years/decades as we need less and less humans to produce (sometimes none if the technology is advanced enough to replace every one with machines). You either pay those people or you let them die.

- Giving people money even to ""unworthies"" allows, among others effects :
•Social peace by lowering crime rates. Extreme poverty makes you do dumb and dangerous things.
•Boost the local economy : if you have some money, you can buy. Without welfare, that would mean that a lot of commercial area + artisans (including people who were not benefiting from welfare directly) would just run out of business and put more people into unemployment.

You might consider it is a plaster on a wooden leg, that we should form them and give them work instead. But the fact is that full employment is over, for ever. When we needed dozens of people to work a field, now you need 1 with a tractor.

It might be ilegal to not give equivalencies to teaching degrees of other EU countries, though there might be conditions such as language fluency.

&gt;I’m obtaining a Bachelors in Art &amp; Photography with a sub in World History along with a teaching credential for single subject (Primary? - High School) I do currently live in the U.S.

I can not kinow for sure but I think it is extremely unlikely a BA in some vague teaching certificate from the USA will give you the certification to teach in any EU country. Nevermind that you would need native levels of fluency in the language of your students. 

There might be foreign schools which follow different curricula, and then the students´ education is validated later at some stage, if there are american curricula schools in Europe those schools might employ teachers with american certificates but that is up to them.

1183,"The concerns are real, but the article overdramatizes some parts.

&gt;  Protesters are blocking streets and chanting Bandu het! (“Bandits out!”). Smoke again permeates Kiev’s chilly air. The police are again trying to clear out protesters’ tents. The scale is smaller than four years ago, when demonstrators on Maidan square overthrew the corrupt regime of President Viktor Yanukovych.

Comparing the current street protests to Euromaidan makes them looks more serious than they are. In fact, they are smaller than initial pro-EU demonstrations 4 years ago before the beating of people exploded them into a mass protest. However, social tensions are rising, so if Poroshenko and coalition continue to blatantly push against anti-corruption effort more people will come to the streets.

&gt; Mr Avakov wants to shift Ukraine towards a parliamentary system that would give each power player his due.

That makes Avakov look more benevolent that he is. He is currently supported by People's Front party which got &gt; 20% at the last elections, but now its rating is ~1-2%, so he is pulling his weight around (and he does have a lot of political weight) to make sure that he remains in the politics after the next elections.

&gt; As Mr Poroshenko’s approval rating falls, Ukrainians’ positive attitudes towards Russia are rising.

I found [these polls](https://s0.rbk.ru/v6_top_pics/resized/945xH/media/img/3/32/755093521862323.png): ""What is your attitude to Russia in general?"". While the attitudes are somewhat more positive than in 2015 I would assume that the primary reason for that that there are no large-scale fighting in Donbass and the conflict faded into background a bit. Also it's not like other Ukrainian politicians are pro-Russians (well, some of them are, but usually not too explicitly).

&gt; The ruling coalition responded with contempt, crippling NABU by removing its main political backer, the head of the parliament’s anti-corruption committee, from his post. 

It's a bit arbitrary to call Sobolev ""NABU's main political backer"". The main concern here is not that Sobolev was removed, but that the coalition will choose their puppet as a head of the committee which in its turn will help them to elect a suitable NABU auditor effectively puting NABU under the coalitions's and Poroshenko's control.

There's also another initiative in the parliament that may further the corruption by striking a blow against transparency of governmental procurement. On Thursday the ""Buy Ukrainian"" law passed the first reading. The law allows to go with an offer that is up to 43% more expensive if the contractor in question is a local business.

&gt;BRASILIA/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The European Union farm products offer presented this week during talks in Brasília on a trade deal with the Mercosur bloc was disappointing, negotiators for Brazil and Argentina said on Friday. 
 Brazil’s chief negotiator, Ambassador Ronaldo Costa Filho, said the European offer to allow 70,000 tonnes of beef and 600,000 tonnes of ethanol to enter the EU with lower tariffs **was far from what Mercosur members were expecting and will make the goal of reaching a deal by December more difficult**.

I have a hard time believing that the EU agricultural ""powers"" will sign a deal that will let Brazilian and Argentinian farmers sell their products tariff free.  Did you forget how ""Trumpian"" French farmers get when it's tiem to protect their agricultural subsidies?

1376,"&gt; UKRAINE is in turmoil—again. Protesters are blocking streets and chanting Bandu het! (“Bandits out!”). Smoke again permeates Kiev’s chilly air. The police are again trying to clear out protesters’ tents. The scale is smaller than four years ago, when demonstrators on Maidan square overthrew the corrupt regime of President Viktor Yanukovych. But once again, Ukraine’s viability as a state is at stake.
&gt; The catalyst of the latest upheaval is Mikheil Saakashvili, a former president of Georgia who entered Ukrainian politics after the Maidan uprising to help fight corruption. After serving as governor of the Odessa region, Mr Saakashvili turned against Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine’s president, who responded by stripping him of his Ukrainian citizenship while he was abroad. (He had already lost his Georgian citizenship.) Bundled through a border post by his supporters, the stateless Mr Saakashvili defiantly re-entered the country and, on December 3rd, staged a rally calling for Mr Poroshenko’s impeachment.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Two days later Ukraine’s security services came to arrest him. Mr Saakashvili climbed to the top of an eight-storey building and rallied his supporters from the roof. When agents grabbed him, the crowd blocked their van and freed him. With one wrist still dangling a handcuff, Mr Saakashvili led his supporters to the Rada, Ukraine’s parliament, to demand Mr Poroshenko’s resignation.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Poroshenko’s attempted show of force ended up exposing his weakness, as well as that of a state plagued by secret deals and graft. The root of the crisis lies in the failure of the governing elites to meet the Maidan revolution’s main demand: ending the country’s oligarchic system.
&gt; 
&gt; The hope that Ukraine’s corrupt elites could themselves reform Ukraine and introduce the rule of law was never high. But their dependence on Western support, and the West’s alliance with Ukraine’s thriving civil-society activists, gave some cause for optimism. Both these factors have since weakened. Civil society has failed to build political muscle, while the European Union is suffering Ukraine fatigue. Most important, says Yulia Mostovaya, the editor of Zerkalo Nedeli, an independent weekly, is that America no longer has a comprehensive Ukraine policy.
&gt; Reform deformed
&gt; American policy now focuses on security, giving short shrift to internal problems. President Donald Trump has little interest in state-building in Ukraine. (He may also resent Ukraine for helping American investigators to indict Paul Manafort, his former campaign manager.) No senior official keeps watch over Ukrainian politicians. “It is a test of Ukrainian democracy without America,” says Ms Mostovaya.
&gt; 
&gt; Over the past few months the situation in Ukraine has deteriorated. Anti-corruption activists and opposition politicians are under pressure. Mr Saakashvili’s allies have been harassed. Some journalists fear for their safety. Exhausted by war and still lacking functioning institutions, Ukraine risks descending into feudal violence. Oligarchs are now measured not just by their money, loyal MPs and private TV channels, but also by the size of their armed forces.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the most powerful figures is Arsen Avakov, the interior minister and a business tycoon. Mr Avakov controls the police and the national guard, as well as a television channel. Formally Mr Avakov is in coalition with Mr Poroshenko, but in fact he views him as a rival oligarch. Mr Avakov wants to shift Ukraine towards a parliamentary system that would give each power player his due.
&gt; 
&gt; Ukraine’s squabbling elites take little responsibility for their state, uniting only to battle the civil activists and independent institutions that threaten their oligopoly. The most critical battle is around the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), the sole credible institution that pressure from civil society and Western backers has brought into being. Trained by America’s FBI, NABU started to attack serious vested interests in Ukraine, provoking an inevitable counter-attack.
&gt; 
&gt; The fight escalated in October, after NABU detained Mr Avakov’s son in connection with the suspected embezzlement of $521,000 through a contract to supply backpacks to the interior ministry. Mr Avakov perceived this as a declaration of war by Mr Poroshenko, and dispatched national guardsmen and police officers to block roads in Kharkiv to prevent his son’s arrest. Mr Avakov, who previously backed NABU as a counterweight against Mr Poroshenko, withdrew his support, leaving it exposed.
&gt; 
&gt; On November 29th the prosecutor general’s office, controlled by Mr Poroshenko, disrupted a sting operation investigating the deputy head of the immigration service, who had allegedly offered to sell Ukrainian citizenship to foreigners for $30,000. NABU’s undercover agent was in the process of handing over a “bribe” when she was arrested by the prosecutor general’s men. The agent was later released, but the operation had been foiled. Artem Sytnik, the head of NABU, says his agency is outmatched: “All we have is our integrity and our conviction that we are doing the right thing.”
&gt; 
&gt; Both the EU and the American government issued strongly worded statements. “These actions appear to be part of an effort to undermine independent anti-corruption institutions that the United States and others have helped support,” the State Department said. The ruling coalition responded with contempt, crippling NABU by removing its main political backer, the head of the parliament’s anti-corruption committee, from his post. It also tried to push through a law to remove NABU’s independence, but backed down in the face of protests from civil-society activists and the IMF, which funds Ukraine’s debt.
&gt; 
&gt; The oligarchs are confident that America lacks the will to back up its rhetoric. Admitting that Ukraine is corrupt and dysfunctional would prompt uncomfortable questions among American voters about their country’s involvement and sanctions against Russia.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Poroshenko, whose popularity rests on the war with Russia, casts his internal opponents as Russian agents. His prosecutor general accuses Mr Saakashvili of trying to mount a coup on Russia’s behalf. In fact, the coup is being mounted in Kiev, whose rulers are pushing their country away from the West. As Mr Poroshenko’s approval rating falls, Ukrainians’ positive attitudes towards Russia are rising.

1458,"If it's 1 federalised Europe - probably not. Because it's inherently about changing one's ideas. Currently it's: 

- We think human rights are good to lambast others with. 

- We think democracy by toppling foreign dictators is best. 

- We think freedom is paramount and thus limit it for others. 

There ought to be a change in attitude which is more akin to the Russian, Iranian and Chinese ones: 

- Non-interference in local affairs as much as possible. Including when for example sending aid. Western aid always comes attached with conditions which complicate things and potentially make things worse (after all, if you're going hungry or need medical help or need help to build infrastructure, the last thing you probably want to hear is *""are you respecting women's rights by doing XYZ like we do?). Especially because if this was done in the opposite direction it wouldn't be accepted. (Like: hi Germany, for us to help you, you need to follow Sharia law - Saudi Arabia).  

- Always opting for multilateralism if possible. No unilateralism.

- Seeking out win-win situations as much as possible. 

- An end to all the ridiculous fakery surrounding the aforementioned ""values"" as something that needs to be imposed on others. That ""our"" way of thinking is correct or better and that if you disagree, you're ripe for being attacked or sabotaged (which is how the West has been rolling, once you look closer). 

- Generally not depending so much on alliances. Especially not military ones. Cooperation? Yes, good, do that. 

Of course most liberal westerners don't see anything wrong with our way of doing anything. Because they're blinded by the hype, propaganda and misdirection, if you ask me. It's like: we literally attack dozens of countries and then condemn the aggression of other countries. It's so so so weird and inconsistent. It hollows out the otherwise good notions of ""democracy"" and ""freedom"" by making them meaningless. Its like we talk about freedom, but then we build spy states.

1554,"&gt; Except for the clothes, both look stereotype American slaves

That's what you say, but you have yet to prove this. Let us assume your assertion for the sake of argument - you'd still be messing up somewhere as your initial claim was that ""his current look was invented by a school teacher that modelled them on black slaves.""

However, you can just look at the picture I linked to earlier and see that the character doesn't have the current look at all - unless you count skin colour as a mark of slavery, of course.

&gt; You made a universal claim about people wearing nice clothes not being slaves. If you want I can probably provide you with pictures from well dressed Portuguese slaves if they work in the wealthy poeple's homes. 

Sure. Slaves were very much accepted in Portugal, but not in The Netherlands. In fact, The Netherlands was a place escaped slaves fled to because they actually had a chance there.

&gt; In fact given that it probably wasn't the majority, and for sure wasn't the majority in power showing that there needed to be resistance kinda shows what a racist society it was. 

So... there was plenty of societal pressure to change the laws of the land because it was deemed unacceptable - and that is exactly proof that a society racist. Right. And I bet when society called for women's suffrage, they were totally misogynists.

&gt; So I am confused at this point by your argument. Black Pete wasn't a slave, because he is dressed to nice, but the dress dates from after ww2 ?

There is little to be confused about here. You were talking about the current look. He was dressed too nicely for what would be considered a slave in The Netherlands.

&gt; First I can't find this source, in particular if it's this Thijm, he would've been 8 or 9 when he wrote that.

No, he wrote it decades after, and though admittedly he could be a few years off due to it being so long ago (though 8 or 9 years old for the event sounds in the right neighbourhood), he said it was ""before the events of 1830"", that is, the Belgian Revolution.

The source is his own writing in *De Amsterdammer*, in an edition written in 1884.  

&gt; Which I think is roughly similar to knecht, so you are just playing a semantics game here.

Since you're ascribing a definition to ""knecht"" which it doesn't have, the definition is important here. This is the opposite of a ""semantics game"" - it's the whole point. No, knecht would not be used for slaves. The word didn't have that meaning.

Here's the problem: You've been told that the character was a slave and you believed it. From that point on it coloured your perception, at which point you started projecting that idea onto everything you see about the character. Black Pete [wears plain white](https://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2014/10/27/c/6/0/c608406c-5db4-11e4-876a-08e26b860894.jpg)? Schenkman modeled it after slaves. Current iterations wear nice clothes?

About the French productivity : it is high because the French labor market exclue a lot of low-qualification woker.

Productivity = PNB per work hours...

1612,"&gt; You've got to be kidding. Selective truth, spoken with intention of deception, is a lie too.

And who was deceived and how?

&gt; Make a point.

Are we talking about the budget surplus or public debt? How is making a (true) statement about budget surplus at some point during the year also making any (and a false one at that) statement about public debt?

&gt; Yes, he used cherrypicked and ultimately irrelevant statistic to make financial state of Poland look better than it actually is. He took advantage of underinformed people, who would believe him, to gain support for his party. And it's not a hoax for you?

&gt; Lower than planned for 2017, and the actual for 2016. Both of which numbers are nearly twice bigger than average deficit during 2001-2015 period. Do you see here any financial success to announce?

The deficit is larger nominally, but how big is it in relation to gross domestic product? How big in relation to GDP were its *nominally smaller* values in previous years? What is the ration of public deficit to GDP that is considered healthy by EU?

I don't feel like prolonging this conversation, so I will answer for you: the maximum healthy value of public deficit is 3% of GDP. The deficit planned for 2017 is nominally 59.3 billion PLN, which is 2.9% of GDP, which is, [according to this article](https://oko.press/petru-rekordowy-deficyt-miliardach/), one of the lower values in recent 10 years. In 2009, a much lower nominal value amounted to 7.1 % of GDP.

Who is trying to be deceptive here?

&gt; He also has several new and expensive populist programs to fund.

There is no such thing as a free dinner. More successful states make even bigger spendings. You could say that is because they are more successful, but one could also say the spendings they make are necessary to stimulate economic growth, especially in a situation in which they need to compete with other countries that already do it.

1623,"He's talking about so called 'rods from god'. These wouldn't be 'launched' so much as just released. This would happen through the satellite using its onboard thrust system to brake, allowing the projectile to separate into a sub-orbital trajectory. relatively little energy is expended as the satellite is already moving at orbital velocities, which is thus imparted onto the projectile. Since the course corrections are relatively minor, the satellite should be able to return itself into a stable orbit. Meaning it could be used more than once if it is given multiple projectiles to release.

It's actually a frighteningly simple and effective idea. They're not 1 time use, and the power requirements are practically negligible. The main thing standing in the way of widespread adoption right now is the cost of putting them up there is the fact it would be prohibitive given that we're talking about solid tungsten rods the size of a telephone pole.

The deal was, none of Franco's henchmen will be punished, and most importantly, none of them will lose their amassed property. So to Catalan separatists, and Republicans the new boss is the same as the old boss. The previous King of Spain was part of Franco's administration as well, which fans the flames on that one.

The problem on the Catalan side, is sometimes you'd think the Spanish civil war was the rest of Spain vs. Catalunya.

1792,"&gt; Imagine your carrefour or leclerc supermarkets being bought off by walmart, and that's just the beginning, ending on energy or mining industry, sucking your country of it's natural resources.

The problem is, if you are a country with 6 million people, and say no, you’ll just get punished with sanctions, or maybe an embargo.

That just destroys your economy even worse.

The only way you can refuse to let the big multinational corporations into your country is if you’re large enough.

The EU is large enough to say no, maybe a union between DACH + BeNeLux + Fr would be enough, too, but that’d be close to the lower limit. Anything smaller just gets fucked (see sanctions against Russia).

So, we need a country of similar size, and power, to the US or China (or, in 80 years, India), to be able to say no, and retain our own decisions.

If we want to actually compete with them, we also need to ensure our citizen have many opportunities, and we need to reduce bureaucratic hurdles – which means integration of the economy and fiscal system.

&gt; I don't want centralised social, cultural &amp; educational system.

That’s not required by a federation.

Even in Germany, today, Merkel and the federal government have zero power over education. All education is handled by the states, with completely different systems. Some states have 4 years primary school, others 6. Some have 3 different types of schools after that, some 2, some only one, some have 4 or more. Some let you choose classes in high school, some don’t. The only thing that happened is that the ministers of each state created a concept on how to transfer from one state’s system to another state’s system.

So in a way, I think the EU could do there the same Germany has done, and not enforce anything. And looking at the EU today, this is exactly what it looks like – the new university credit system (ECTS) only defines, if you transfer from one university to other, how to convert the value of one class to the equivalent class in the new university. Every country, sometimes every state (e.g. in Germany) still has its own entirely separate universities, with separate local credit systems, separate educational policies, etc.",Schleswig-Holstein (Germany),/r/europe/comments/7i5xjp/martin_schulz_head_of_the_german_party_spd_wants/dqysthk/,justjanne,1512763850

Heading off down a side track: yeah, though that's really in land, but not population.  Most people in Russia live in western Russia.

&gt;Russia is not proportionately populated between its larger Asian portion, which contains about 23% of the country's population, and its smaller European portion, which contains about 77%. The European portion contains about 110 million people out of Russia's total population of about 144 million in an area covering nearly 4,000,000 km2 (1,500,000 sq mi); an average of 27.5 persons per km2 (70 per sq mi).[2]:6[2]:10

It can also be worth running a deficit on things just to get rid of coal. 

&gt;Also, this whole discussion is pure theory for countries like Germany, where there is no public consent for building nuclear plants.

Same here in Sweden, which is why I'm arguing for it. 

Most anti-nuclear people here also don't really have a clue. Their opinion is that we should all be going 100% renewable. They refuse to accept that there even are any problems with that.

Positive.

100% renewables will take time. Maybe 20 years for countries who already have a lot of it like Germany or UK, it probably takes longer for France or Poland.

The US has an interest in monitoring  German politician's relationships with Russian agents. Many German politicians, especially SDP members, have strong Russian ties. Clearly in the US interest to keep an eye on things.

Second, even strong allies don't know what they don't know. British intel warned the CIA about Achmed Chalably before the Iraq War (too bad CIA didn't listen).

&gt;  “We need to assure that someone doesn’t lose control during a flight. We need to protect our passengers from such a circumstance,” she said.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, German residency law dictates that airlines are legally obliged to take all rejected asylum seekers who the government wishes to deport. Pilots who refuse purely on moral grounds would then likely face legal consequences.
&gt; 
&gt; **“I don’t know of any case in which a pilot refused to take a passenger on moral concerns,”** a spokesperson for Lufthansa told RBB. “We are legally obliged to take the passengers - they have valid tickets.""
&gt; 
&gt; In fact pilots refusing to let people being deported onto their planes rarely happens. In the same time period that 222 deportees were refused by airlines, 16,700 people were deported through German airports.

1919,"I don't see why that's insane. It entirely depends on what will be in the treaty and the treaty will be adjusted if countries disagree. It's not like any country that doesn't agree to some foredefined authoritarian idea gets kicked. The deal is that if the country can't agree with certain fundamentals in any context, even after further negotiations, then they can't be part of the EU. 

And I don't really see the trouble with that. The EU already as it is requires agreements and if certain states are not willing to in any way agree but only want the monetary benefits, then I don't see how they would fit into the EU anyway. This is really just aknowledging reality as it is anyway. If Ireland or the Netherlands for instance do not agree to stop tax evasion (for instance), then the EU is better off without tax evasion and without Ireland and the Netherlands. But why wouldn't the people of these countries agree to stop tax evasion? Of course I see that it's part of their buisness model but in the long run we would all benefit more without it. I think on certain basic principles like this we certainly need a consensus when we form a closer union, otherwise the EU will go down the gutter. Another principle is more EU democracy, the parliament should elect the government, not the council.

After the test was introduced (summer in the year 2000) the Norwegians stopped consistently dominating. No world cup winners between 99' and 2010 were Norwegian.

63 percent the respondents do not agree to Poland's acceptance of refugees from countries subject to armed conflicts, the opposite view is 33 percent, and 4 percent of the respondents have no opinion in this matter - according to the latest CBOS survey.
The study emphasized that among the respondents who were in favor of accepting refugees - 29 percent believes that Poland should give them shelter only until they can return to their country, and few (4%) also agree to settle in Poland.
In the survey, the researchers also checked the attitude of the respondents to accepting refugees from the Middle East and Africa who came to the European Union. Three-quarters of the respondents (75 percent) are opposed to moving them to Poland. 52 percent of respondents in this group expresses a categorical objection (an increase of 9 percentage points compared to the April 2017 study). In turn, 20 percent of the respondents are favorable to the admission of such a group of refugees in Poland.
The survey pointed out that the hypothetical penalty of losing money from EU funds by Poland does not significantly affect opinions regarding the admission of refugees from Muslim countries. Despite the threat of Poland losing funds from EU funds for lack of commitment to the EU relocation program, 74 percent of the respondents believe that we should not accept refugees from Muslim countries, and only 15 percent is of the opposite opinion.
The survey asked respondents about their attitude to the acceptance by our country of the inhabitants of Eastern Ukraine, migrating from areas covered by military operations. The granting of asylum in Poland is approved by 61 percent, 32 percent is against it.
The study compared the opinions of Poles regarding the admission of refugees with declarations of Czechs and Slovaks. It shows that the citizens of our southern neighbors are more critical in this matter. 69 percent Czechs and the same number of Slovaks do not agree to accept refugees from countries affected by armed conflicts. 27% of respondents receive refugees. Czechs and 28 percent. Slovaks. 84 percent Czechs and 81 per cent Slovaks oppose the relocation to their countries of refugees from the Middle East and Africa who came to EU countries. The opposite opinion is 15 percent. Czechs and Slovaks.
Despite the threat of losing funds from EU funds for the lack of commitment to the relocation program, 82 percent Czechs and Slovaks believe that one should not accept refugees from Muslim countries, and only 10 percent of Czechs and 13 percent Slovaks would agree to such a step.
As in regards of the admission of refugees from Ukraine it is 37 percent of Czechs that approach this solution positively, and 57 percent it is the opposed.

2310,"&gt;I am not very familiar with the Swiss model, apart from the basics. Could you write what in your view are the key components that make the Swiss model work?

There isn't much that makes the Swiss language policy work: the cantons chose whatever language they wanted speak themselves, they were given full authonomy when it comes to this question so noone is able to force them to speak German or French if they don't want to.

I think that it's important to have a lingua franca but having everyone in Europe speaking the same language is silly and would be damaging to European cultures.

&gt;Would that model scale well if we went to 500 M people from a higher number of countries?

Swiss cantons have a lot of authonomy and direct democracy but I don't think this could work in different conditions than the ones they have in SL right now. Switzerland is rich, isolated and bordered by the richest members of the EU. There also isn't an issue of foreign policy in Switzerland because of its neutrality and stuff.

In my opinion, if EU were to federalise it would be better to create national governments with a government above it, so people are still ""ruled"" from their homecountries but EU would have more opportunities to intervene (in cases like the Greek crisis because this was unsolvable by Greeks themselves in their situation and anticonstitutional actions from the national government) and have a bigger role in foreign politics.",Belarus,/r/europe/comments/7i7beo/public_support_for_federalization_of_the_european/dqxyhoi/,from3to20symbols,1512719838

2379,"&gt;The decision to authorise the renewal of glyphosate for five years on 27 November could be challenged in court by the Member States. The Belgian lawyer Olivier de Schutter believes that the principle of democracy is being flouted.

&gt;The glyphosate case is not about to close. Following the announcement by several NGOs of a complaint lodged against European expert agencies, a legal study points out that the decision to extend glyphosate for five years infringes several provisions of the European Treaty, the regulation on the placing of plant protection substances on the market and the case law of the Court of Justice.

&gt;On 27 November, the licence for the marketing of glyphosate, the active ingredient in RoundUp and other herbicides, was renewed for five years by the European Parliament. Following, in particular, a controversial flip-flop by Germany, which made it possible to obtain a qualified majority. Nine countries, including Belgium and France, voted against.  

&gt;According to the Belgian lawyer Olivier de Schutter, former UN rapporteur on the right to food, one of these states, or even the European Parliament, could very well bring an action before the European Court of Justice to ask for the annulment of this decision. ""Politically and legally, this decision can be challenged. It would be logical for Belgium to take the first step in court, given its unfavourable position on the use of glyphosate"", confides Olivier de Schutter to Moustique.

Denial of democracy?

&gt;Among the reasons for this, the expert points out that the ""precautionary principle"" was not sufficiently taken into account. ""The safety of glyphosate has never achieved scientific consensus. It should be noted that in 2015, this substance was classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a' likely carcinogen',""the expert points out.

&gt;Also in the spotlight is the questioning of the independence of the analyses carried out by the European agencies EFSA and ECHA. Accused of having been influenced by Monsanto, in defiance of all scientific evidence, these agencies are already under attack in Austria, before the Vienna prosecutor, for fraud, bodily injury, willfully endangering public safety, environmental damage, plagiarism and falsification of documents.

&gt;Finally, the lawyer adds that by voting on this renewal, without taking sufficient account of the million signatures of objections expressed by the Stop Glyphosate initiative, the Commission has failed to respect the principle of democracy, which is fundamental to European treaties. 

&gt;Concretely, it is a violation of the right to table European Citizens' Initiatives (ECIs), even though this mechanism has been set up so that local authorities can call on the European Commission to legislate on a given subject,""confides Olivier de Schutter. Beyond all environmental aspects, the danger is that this health crisis will lead to a crisis of confidence and major legitimacy towards the European institutions. For there is a real denial of democracy.""

&gt;On 12 December, the EU is due to publish its formal decision to extend the substance. From this key date, Parliament and therefore any Member State will have two months to challenge this decision before the European Court of Justice.",,/r/europe/comments/7idmgm/glyphsate_extension_could_be_challenged_in_court/dqxyur0/,uberite,1512720681

You might find some places in the world where that is not true.  But it won't be climate change driving migration into the EU, even if migration were driven by something other than economic concerns.

My assumption is that the reason population growth is referenced is because it politically-resonates.  It can be used to build a sense of responsibility (""the developed world was a factor in climate change, thus it would be reprehensible to object to immigration"").

The reason why is that something like a common currency does not work when everything else about those countries is different. The result of leaving things as they are is that Northern countries develop budget surpluses while Southern countries experience small or even negative economic growth. It's not sustainable.

&gt;  Being a member state of the European Union should be about common values and ideals, and with this an agreement on shared responsibilities -- not just a Machiavellian way to benefit from other countries, but refuse to help as soon as it's on you.

I don't think that's fair. It's not that Hungary or Poland disagree on the values, not at all. I'm sure the majority of people in those countries believe in helping refugees, but they would rather help by sending aid to the countries they are located in, instead of inviting them to come and live in with the locals.

I just calculated yesterday, that in order to pay a 400 euro monthly UBI in Estonia (barely enough to stay alive in shitty conditions) we would have to spend half of our budget on it, all of the current social programs and healthcare programs. For what, to get 400 euros each?

Still I doubt any sensible person is touching a gas victim without gloves, that seems very irresponsible. I also doubt they knew what it was if it was real and they knew how exactly it behaves. 

I now see your document, I havent looked into it since it happened and clearly that detailed information was not available then, back then the footage looked like some amateurs put explosives in a pipe, put footage of that and some people lying down and the inconsistent sarin coverage really screamed like a fake, and there is so much fake news coming from that area it seemed very plausible. Also I obviously missed that there were more than 1, one single would have made zero sense. The picture of the first rocket ive seen also just looked like a pipe bomb. 

So it clearly happened but why would Assad shoot random civilians in a uncoordinated attack? This still seems very fishy. He also sounds very reasonable in the interview. I still sure someone framed him, there are plenty of motives.

This is how I know a Federal EU will not happen. You see, others would completely disagree with you on this.

&gt; What exactly is the solution that would be least bad for all the individual member states?

The best solution is to let each state decide how many refugees it wants to take.

&gt; Are you from France or Germany? I am, and I disagree.

&gt; Note that the amount of refugees coming into these countries right now is (1) not the same number of people that will actually stay

The vast majority of refugees (80-90%) aren't going anywhere.

Not quite.  While actually we do have some thresholds for getting on the ballot in some states, it's not like Turkey or some other places where there's a hard threshold in the vote for getting legislative seats and thus influence on the executive.  The real limitation is that the winner in a state takes all of the state's votes (""winner takes all"").  That's not a US requirement, but nearly every state does this.

So, basically, if you vote for someone other that the preferable of the Big Two parties, you reduce the vote count of the party you'd prefer of those two by one.

The IRA was fairly well organised and had excellent fundraisers in the US (and elsewhere to an extent). The Loyalist paramilitaries were far less competent at being terrorists, and though they often had the assistance of the British military and RUC, they were never able to attract the kind of funding for weapons.

On the other hand, Ireland does not have the huge military and police apparatus which the UK has, should trouble arise, and various far-right groups internationally might be happy to fund Loyalist violence. 

IF a United Ireland ever happens, I'd think that quite a lot of groundwork would have to be done with the Loyalist community to help them to feel safe and valued within the wider community. 


My concern is that a badly done Brexit could hammer the Northern Irish economy - aside from all aspirations and fears about the future status of NI in all directions, if her economy isn't given a chance to grow and provide great opportunities to the people living up there, it will be that much easier for violent extremists to garner support and recruits.",Ἐρῑνύς,/r/europe/comments/7i5idl/479_would_back_a_united_ireland_in_the_event_of_a/dqxdvaq/,YetAnotherUsername_,1512692040

-

&gt; I am now going to say something that will astonish you.

&gt;The first step in the re-creation of the European family must be a partnership between France and Germany.

-

&gt;Our constant aim must be to build and fortify the strength of the United Nations Organisation.
&gt;
&gt;Under and within that world concept, we must re-create the European family in a regional structure called, it may be, the United States of Europe.
&gt;
&gt;The first step is to form a Council of Europe.

&gt;If at first all the States of Europe are not willing or able to join the Union, we must nevertheless proceed to assemble and combine those who will and those who can.

Not particularly, even if stupidity and ignorance do offend me.

&gt; it's not like the French government is responsible for that.

“A language is a dialect with an army and a navy.”  Max Weinreich. Politics and governments are responsible for our modern standardised languages, not least Algemeen Beschaafd Nederlands : it must be the only language in the world with an intergovernmental organisation (the Taalunie) dedicated to maintaining its unity (even the Académie Française and the Real Academia Española maintain independence from their respective governments). Up until the 19th century, only a literate, mostly urban minority spoke in something like our modern languages: most people lived in villages, were hardly literate, and spoke in a hotchpotch of local dialects that changed from a village to the next. Much of Germany, from the Rhine valley to the Baltic coast, spoke not in today’s official High German or any of its dialects, but in any of a variety of Low German dialects, closer at times to Dutch and Frisian than to High German. There was even a Slavic dialect close to Berlin, Sorbian. Modern-day Belgium wasn’t cleanly cut into Dutch- and French-speakers, but split into a myriad dialects straddling across the Romance and Germanic families, with only a wealthy minority (either in Flanders or Wallonia) speaking French. Even in France, which had started on the path of linguistic standardisation before everyone else, with the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts in the 16th century, most of the Southern half of the country still spoke “langue d’oc” dialects, rather than the official French that had grown from the “langue d’oil“. Napoleon the Corsican hardly spoke any French when he arrived to the military academy, and Bretons mostly spoke their own Celtic language (or rather, one of a variety of local dialects thereof). Only compulsory education, conscription, the railroads, industrialisation, migration towards larger cities and finally broadcasting led to the lingüistic standardisation and clean linguistic borders of the 20th century. But any idea of “identity”, that is, “sameness”, whether linguistic or “ethnic”, was still quite foreign to our ancestors prior to the Napoleonic Wars and, above all, the “Spring of Nations” of 1848.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/7hypda/the_eus_biggest_standing_armies/dqx6l9w/,Rc72,1512683905

2864,"I don't know about Trom_bone but I think neither of us want the problem of gender inequality to be dismissed as only present in ""certain cultures"". However I also don't want all types of gender inequality being discussed as one and the same. 

""Gender inequality"" *is* present in every culture, because it is a really low-resolution concept. We also have inequalities between rich and poor people in every country, but talking about rich-poor inequality in China and rich-poor inequality in Europe are just different cases. The cases involve different different mechanisms, different degrees of how much the population cares or has a say in the matter, different degrees of harm inflicted, and most importantly different degrees of extremity.

FGM is not comparable with sexual harassment (although both are bad behaviors). They involve different degrees of support in the population, different power hierarchies, different motivations, different degrees of harm inflicted on the victim, and most importantly different levels of extremity.

O'Neill's Statement does by no means reflect the not-very-subtle differences between two cases. This would be excusable if the topic of gender inequality was a topic that was very new and recently had become the focus of attention. This however is not the case. Gender Inequality has been an important topic for quite some time and I think by now it is not too much expected that the people who try to fight it actually make important distinctions and criticize clearly, instead of using the same vague concepts as soon as they roughly fit a topic.

In the UK young people [vote](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2017-06-13/Age-01.png) overwhelmingly for Labour, who are increasingly moving to the left.

3002,"I hardly missed your point. You missed mine, out of sheer ignorance:

First of all, the Flemish weren't ""kept separate from their motherland"": first it was the Dutch Republic which separated from them (and from the German Empire), and then, when the Low Countries were briefly reunited under the Kingdom of the Netherlands after the Treaty of Vienna, it was the Belgians (including the Flemish) who decided they couldn't abide the Dutch any longer. Thus, the Netherlands isn't any more the ""motherland"" of the Flemish than Germany is of the Dutch.

Secondly, Alsace was annexed to France in 1648 by the Treaty of Westphalia, incidentally the same that also recognized the independence of the Dutch Republic from the Holy Roman German Empire. Afterwards, Alsace just rejoined Germany for two periods (1871-1918 and 1940-1945), neither of which left very fond memories among the locals (especially not by those who, during the second one, were forcibly drafted and sent to the Russian Front). Again, pretending that Germany is the ""motherland"" of the Alsatians has about as solid a historical support as pretending it is yours.

Finally, if you are trying to base your claim on some notion of ethnic or linguistic ""identity"", be mindful that linguistic borders, never mind ""ethnic"" ones, are exceedingly vague and blurry. For instance, not only is Alsatian very much a minority language in modern-day Alsace, it's also about as close to the Swabian dialect spoken on the other side of the Rhine as the Limburg dialect spoken in Maastricht is to the Platt German spoken in Aachen.

So, as I already wrote, just shut up, Swamp German.

Thirdly, the actions that are controversial: 
On September 20, 2007, the Slovak parliament adopted a resolution concerning the untouchability of postwar documents, such as the Benes Decree which collectively criminalizes the Hungarian and German minority of Slovakia. The law passed with the support of every party of Slovakia except the Hungarian one.

In 2009 the Slovak parliament passed a language law, mandating preferential use of the state language – Slovak. Use of a non-state language when conducting business could carry a financial penalty. Similarly, a penalty could be given for publishing books, journals or scientific proceedings in a language other than Slovak, or for singing in public in languages other than Slovak or the song's original language.
According to the law penalty can be issued between 100 to 5000 euros.

Say someone makes an app here in Greece, a successful one like skourz, which uses machine learning and does genuine bargaining behind the scenes to present you with the best possible price for anything that you want from the majority of retailers in the country, which you can then buy with a single click.

You can't just scale that to all of Europe. Countries have different retailers. Even retailers inder the same brand often have completely different country divisions with different pricing and with no communication within them. After Greece Skroutz went to Turkey and the UK. They had to basically make new deals with all retailers in two new, bigger countries. That's impossible. Both of these countries are in the customs union so technically you could just display Greek stores in there, it's not like you would pay tarrifs. But that's not how shit works remotely. 

China and the US on the other hand are one huge market. It would be insane NOT to target the entire US at once. So those who end up on top, win big. 

If the EU knew what they were doing they would cover a significant part of the scaling costs for buisneses. So that if I make a product or a service, I can just as easily sell it to all of Europe.

3411,"&gt; It goes to show that large groups of foreigners with different tribal loyalties within a nation is destabilizing.

Except it doesnt show it at all. Rome had a huge history of succesfully integrating refugees into their empire with no problems at all. 

The reason for the Goths revolting isnt ""muh multiculturism"" but the treatment they got from the the Roman border forces lead by Flavius Lupicinus.
From his Wikipediapage:

&gt; Lupicinus next appeared in 376 as the commander of Roman troops in the Diocese of Thrace. There he oversaw the settlement of the Goths within the empire along the Lower Danube. **There, he proceeded to extort and starve the foreign refugees until they broke into an open revolt that provoked the Gothic War of 376.** After orchestrating a failed assassination attempt of the Gothic leaders while ostensibly meeting with them to discuss a peace, Lupicinus led his troops into a total defeat at the Battle of Marcianople. It was said that Lupicinus' actions in the battle were both foolish and cowardly. He was apparently superseded by new commanders in 377. It is unknown if Lupicinus was cashiered, executed or killed in subsequent battles.

The Roman border forces treated them like shit. And Ammianus Marcellinus blames what was about to happen solely on the greedy roman border guards

&gt; ""And their treacherous covetousness was the cause of all our disasters. . . . For when the barbarians who had been conducted across the river were in great distress from want of provisions, those detested generals conceived the idea of a most disgraceful traffic; and having collected dogs from all quarters with the most insatiable rapacity, they exchanged them for an equal number of slaves, among whom were several sons of men of noble birth. . . .""",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7i28kz/meanwhile_in_germany/dqw7ymw/,Too_Drunk_To_Write,1512640633

The reason why there are still contested territories is that these negotiations have not been able to come to a reasonable conlusion and the Palestinians and their allies hold a big part of responsibility for that. Of course Israel can also be partly blamed for the failure of the negotiations.

Regardless of that, we did not recognize that Israel grabbed the whole Jerusalem, we recognized only the west part of Jerusalem in the pre-1967 borders as Israel's capital. If Arabs didn't want Israel to occupy the other part, they should not have attacked Israel in 1967.

Plus, we are not in charge of the negotiations. They negotiations have been basically non-existent for years now. You're making it sound as if we somehow spoiled an agreement that was about to happen any time soon. But the parties are hardly even talking to each other. There was no peace deal happening with or without this decision.

Plus, the Palestianians are also making unilateral steps to gain approval from the international community and they succeed in that way more often than Israel. They have the support of the majority of the Islamic world, they have a part of Europe behind them, a big part of Africa and the UN and its bodies pass pro-palestinian and anti-Israel resolutions very often.

....Lastly, they tried to scare us with the bogey of the disintegration of Russia, of its splitting up into numerous independent states and hinted thereby that the right of nations to self-determination proclaimed by the Council of People's Commissars was a ""fatal mistake."" But I must declare most categorically that we would not be democrats (I say nothing of socialism!) if we did not recognize the right of the peoples of Russia to free self-determination. I declare that we would be betraying socialism if we did not do everything to restore-fraternal confidence between the workers of Finland and Russia. But everyone knows that the restoration of this confidence is inconceivable unless the right of the Finnish people to free self-determination is firmly recognized. And it is not merely the verbal, even if official, recognition of this right that is important here. What is important is that this verbal recognition will be confirmed by the act of the Council of People's Commissars, that it will be put into effect without hesitation. For the time for words has passed. **The time has come when the old slogan ""Workers of all countries, unite!"" must be put into effect.**

Complete freedom for the Finnish people, and for the other peoples of Russia, to arrange their own life! **A voluntary and honest alliance of the Finnish people with the Russian people!** No tutelage, no supervision from above, over the Finnish people! These are the guiding principles of the policy of the Council of People's Commissars.

Only as the result of such a policy can mutual confidence among the peoples of Russia be created. Only on the basis of such confidence can the peoples of Russia be united in one army. Only by thus uniting the peoples can the gains of the October Revolution be consolidated and the cause of the international socialist revolution advanced.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/7i52zi/reurope_for_the_past_few_days/dqw86cf/,onkko,1512641219

In part this is just my personal relationship with this name. It doesn't always apply. It does to ""Timothy"". It doesn't to ""Steven"". Most Stevens I know are just Steve. Most Davids I know are Dave. But they are common enough names, cross social and class boundaries and either form is fine and at least to me do not carry these connotations in either form. Matthew is I guess the same too. 

Interestingly I cannot at the moment think of typical female names this applies to in quite the same way. It is very much about status and ""projecting yourself"" in a certain way, which I guess are more male characteristics anyway. Or maybe we just ignored women's feelings on the matter for so long that it's part of the zeitgeist to just not give a shit. Curious. I hadn't considered this aspect before. 

It is strange. And probably also a moving target because of changing fashions in names. Christopher was one of the most common boys names in English speaking countries around the time I was born (I'm mid 40s now, fwiw). It isn't unfashionable now but it is less common.

To make a bad joke, ethnicity IS a social construct. It's not something you are, but something you consider yourself to be. So it's therefore stupid to say ""ah, but Moldovans ARE Romanians, because until very recently they were"". They do not consider themselves Romanians so therefore they are not.

Japan's approach is to do legal immigration but try to backdoor people in as much as possible and give the immigration a low profile.

&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Desperately seeking an antidote to a rapidly aging population, Japanese policymakers are exploring ways to bring in more foreign workers without calling it an “immigration policy”. 

[Illegal immigration works in the US](https://youtube.com/watch?v=C52TlPCVDio) because we have *jus soli*, which you don't.  We get a worker who doesn't get to draw from welfare followed by a US citizen when they have kids.  You'd just get multiple generations of people with no nationality on file.

So someone's gotta take a politically-unpopular move and have immigration from somewhere.

There's your set of constraints.

* The publics of Europe will probably not accept immigration.

* If you don't get more people somewhere, you're in for major problems.  Probably should have already been doing so.

* It's hard to make people have more children.  No existing fertility policy in Europe has gotten even one member up to replacement rate.

If you are just visiting a country, you could ask for a short stay visa (less than 90 days is the maximum stay with that in the US), easy to ask for, easily conceded. For traveling to the US you have to ask for it one-two weeks in advance, and by that time you should already have your plane tickets and all.

If you are going to Europe to work, you need to prove it,  and if your stay is going to take longer than three months you will need a reason to justify what are you going to do all that time in there. Also makes sense for me.

Are you necesarilly sure about that? Czechia? Estonia? Poland? Greece? Your logistics performance index is below India actually. The lone infrastructure ranking even below Brazil &amp; Kenya and also multiple eastern european countries, Hungary and Lithuania among others ([see Worldbank](https://lpi.worldbank.org/international/global?sort=asc&amp;order=Infrastructure#datatable)). Though first of all it is hard to measure and 2nd of all it is not that indicative of wealth or living well as one would think. You rank above Iceland for instance. 

&gt; you know the HDI doesn't always reflect fairly the country's reality.

Again, yeah.

&gt; And to compare Portugal with Chile must be a joke...

But this most definitely isn't a joke. Chile is an exceptionally developed country for its region. If I had to move to any American country I think the top contenders would be Chile, Costa Rica and Canada. Also checking the world happiness report. Chile ranks on equal footing with Germany (and they have a higher health life expectancy than us). Portugal ranks on equal footing with the Lebanon and as the lowest among all developted countries by those metrics. I mean Chile has 4.000-6.000 GDP per capita less than Portugal, yeah. But why would it necesarilly be less developed than Portugal? Denmark also by most estimaties has less GDP per capita than Germany but being someone who is partly danish and partly german and very familiar with both countries (who lives in Germany), I don't think there is much debate about which country is more developed (it's Denmark of course). But there's also no doubt that if we simply talk about infrastructure, Germany absolutely sacks Denmark (like almost any country - in the worldbank report Germany ranks as #1 actually - but Germany also has great potential for good infrastructure in a country like Denmark, the geography makes good infrastructure harder). I think there are many measurements of development and Chile is certainly a developed country which I could see on similar footing with Portugal. I don't really see what makes you consider that a joke. 

And this is definitely not meant to be some Portugal bashing but in most statistics Portugal performs exceptionally poor, sometimes only given its region (by most wealth and development standards), sometimes even on a global scale (happiness, fertility rate). In a select few like life expectansy and making the best film of the decade you do really well by all measures.

Though on a purely personal account (no statistics) I think Portugal is a very fascinating country. Your landscapes for instance seem gorgeous and your geography intricate and simply given the mindset of people I would expect to fit much better into Portugal than any of the former Soviet bloq states (I must say I frequently find their political climate very alienating and they are the people I'm most frequently at odds with on Reddit). I think on the grand scale of things you're probably a rather popular country. ",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7hwzsl/total_population_change_20102017/dqvqqa4/,tobias_681,1512612147

3814,"Im a college student so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but the way I see it the United States and to a certain degree some of its allies are in a cold war like state with Russia and its Allies. The US is attempting to wage economic warfare against Russia through sanctions, and The US is involved in a soft proxy war with Russia in the middle East and in some sense the Ukraine and North Korea. 
The situation is the Ukraine is not moving anywhere and it seems that Russia primary goal was to freeze the Ukrainian states ability to act in a contrary manner to Russia, Russia has won a tactical victory in the Ukraine but at a high strategic cost due to souring Ukrainian opinions of Russia, and an increasingly belligerent west.
    In the Mid East I think Russia is faring better, They have managed to keep their ally Assad in power in Syria, and Iran (a loose ally) is growing stronger and stronger which is causing the Israelis and Saudis to begin cooperating in fear of Iran and their Shia proxy wars. Increasingly Turkey also sees eye to eye with Russia and Turkeys future in Nato could be in doubt in the near future. Russia has also made trade inroads in Saudi Arabia and have established a military base in Egypt, but these gains are modest and both nations remain firmly in the US sphere of influence.
     Russia in my opinion is probably has a measured relationship with DPRK but they are first and foremost in the ""Chinese sphere of influence""

Overall (from my laymans opinion) Russia seems to be faring poorly on its European front while its has achieved better results, and has seen a modest increase in influence in the Middle East. I do not think Russia is a huge concern in the immediate future, and I think you should be more concerned about an escalating Saudi/Iranian proxy war that is heating up substantially, especially with the news today of the Israeli news. I think that the only real risk that Russia would pose is if the middle Easter situation deteriorated to the point where the entire region would be engulfed in total war and Russia intervened on behalf of Iran or its other allies against the US/Saudi/Israeli coalition. But I think this would be unlikely as I dont believe Russia has any interest in a major land war at this time due to their demographic situation.

Not about the British people who've been fooled, but their government is clearly corrupted to the bone, and as much incompetent as irresponsible.  

It's been decades that Europe, especially Germany and UK, were pointing out the French politicians for their alleged corruption and incompetence, bracing each other about their supposed economic model or political courage. And for reasons: the French politics are all but examples.  They were also praising their only strong protector and ally, the US of A, because shrink and more business means more money, who cares about sovereignty when uncle Sam is covering your ads under fuck tons of cash money in tax havens.  

And today, watching UK deception falling apart, and Germany not being capable to have a proper government. Also the US becoming the most irrelevant, corrupted and dangerous country over the world, the like of North Korean threat^^10 to the world..

It gets more complicated when the government makes a deal that is against the will of its people, to make it easy Ill use this specific example: while Poles were strongly against migrant quotas, the previous government with Tusk voted for them. That played an important part in them losing the next elections. The new government still has those obligations (the deal is still valid), so if they refuse to uphold them - they absolutely should be prepared to be punished.

But like in mountaineering, the higher you are the slower you advance further, which is why developing countries such as Nigeria or India can feature such phenomenal growth rates - because they're still near the bottom where the air is thick.  
Poland is much further than that and still has a way to go. It also gives you an advantage in that your wages are much lower than Germany's, attracting much investment from there. But growth is not an issue with your currency, be it Zloty or Euro - that's an issue of how you as a nation decide to style yourself. How successful are you in combating corruption? In growing a medium business size sector (Germany's strength)? Getting education, taxation, housing and infrastrucure right so it works out?  
Those are all national problems that the currency has little do with.

&gt; The part with Alexander

I'll elaborate on that :) During Alexander the Great's expansion against the Thracians, he saw that the Triballian lands extended as far as the Ister (old name for the Danube) and the island of Peuce was held by the Getae. Alexander decided not to go to Peuce because he didn't have boats but he did cross the Ister River and go to the Getae land. When he went to the Getae land, he easily defeated the Getaes on his first charge, plundered their place, and razed it to the ground. After this, the Getae were sent northward to their cities and then to their mountains. Alexander then took whatever plunder the Getae left behind and returned back home when it was daylight.

Similar deal with my boss. He's called Timothy. Again, not a royal name. Very middle class. 

His dad is a lawyer and his mum is a doctor. Old school middle class professions. Their parents would have had some money backing them up for both of them to get the educations they did (at that time) to become those things. 

He answers to Timothy or Tim.

Call me Christopher and I will lose my shit with you. My *actual* name is Chris. ""Christopher"" sounds to my ears like an affectation. It does to both my parents too. My mum was a nurse, my dad a fireman who had advanced through the ranks. Both of their fathers were miners and mothers were housewives. They achieved ""post war"" middle class professions.

Nobody calls me Christopher. Timothy did, and he does not see what the issue is. He doesn't do it anymore. His hair is still waving in the breeze from my reaction the last time he did it. He does not mind Timothy at all. When I say it it *feels* like I am making fun of him so I call him Tim.

""Henry"" is a royal name that has seeped lower. Kids from rough places might get beaten up just for being called that though.

So

Queen: Brenda

Prince Phillip: Keith

Prince Charles: Brian

IIRC Diana's was 'Cheryl'

Not sure the younger generation have them. Doesn't feel like they need them. The purpose is to ""humanise"" them. Or rather, bring them down to our level. These are old school working class names. Brenda has long since fallen out fashion. Kids today wouldn't get that name purely for fashion reasons. But it was still prevalent in the 60s when (I think) they got these nicknames from the satirical press of the day. Probably Private Eye magazine which still habitually calls her that.

Finland got its independence in the midst of the Bolshevik  revolution. The Tsar Russia would not have recognized the independence but Lenin did, probably thinking that we’d join the glorious proletariat union anyway once they got the revolution stuff over with.

Just a few months after the independence declaration, the growing tensions between the ”Whites” and ”Reds”—basically the owning and working classes respectively—escalated to an armed conflict. The Whites won and Finland adopted a politically neutral stance. The war was a traumatic experience to the fledgling nation state and left deep wounds to the collective psyche of the Finns.

In WW2 Finland fought three separate wars: the Winter War and Continuation War against the Soviets and the Lapland War against our former allied the Germans, having to evict German forces from Finland as a part of the peace treaty with the Soviets.

Finland hosted the Summer Olympics of 1952; it was a great source of pride to the young nation, still a poor, largely agrarian economy and burdened by heavy war reparations. However, those reparations were mostly in form of heavy machinery—train engines, ships, and agrarian machinery—which pushed Finland to industrialize at a rapid pace. 

Finland treaded a fine line in the Cold War, remaining officially neutral, trying to market itself as a Western country but out of necessity having to make concessions to our Soviet overlords. Nevertheless, Finland remained a multi-party parliamentary democracy with a non-planned economy, mostly free media and all the civil rights one would expect. 

After the Soviet Union fell, Finland was at a much better position economically than the former Varsova pact countries and quickly completed its ”Westernization” by joining the EU, and a few years later, the Euro.",,/r/europe/comments/7hx9cp/celebrating_100_years_of_finnish_independence/dqv6fjm/,Sharlinator,1512590443

4227,"&gt; Ireland (on behalf of the EU) have literally suggested that the territorial integrity of the UK ought to be compromised with an internal border to protect the Single Market.

Isn't Irelands issue that they don't want a hard border that would threaten the GFA? The compromising of integrity already happened with the GFA and is the status quo.

&gt; I'm saying the EU should act in the interests of Europe as a whole as it considers itself honour-bound to do rather than acting solely in the interests of the EU political entity. Ultimately, intentionally punishing the UK will directly result in the loss of jobs within the EU as well as the UK, do you think it is right that EU citizens should have the bread taken off their table in the name of punishing the UK?

But what exactly is the purpose of the Union if they treated everyone in and outside exactly the same? Shouldn't it be obvious that people inside the have more benefits than people outside?
If the EU does nothing and bends over to the UK, it signals to every member you can throw a fit and still get what you want. That might lead to other countries wanting the same treatment, which would lead to the dreaded domino effect. And that would ultimately take more bread from EU citizens than this current negotiating does.

&gt; To an extent, yes. Insisting on a diamond-hard deadline of two years rather than giving these matters the due consideration they need is particularly unreasonable. With enough time, a bespoke customs deal could reduce the impact on the border communities in Northern Ireland, a transition period leading to a comprehensive FTA could reduce job losses on both sides of the channel and demanding the ECJ has jurisdiction over certain classes of UK residents is just insanity. No other free nation has what will then be a foreign court overruling the local justice system.

I don't necessarily agree with the 2-year timeline, but that's how article 50 is written and everyone knew that in advance. However, I am in favor of a transition period, and I believe the EU has already agreed to grant one.

We acquired most of the Empire by accident with East India Company making decisions on the ground and winging it, and then notifying the govt later.

There was one episode where the Dutch Republic sought to corner the entire market in nutmeg and colonised a bunch of islands in south east asia (the spice islands of indonesia). 

Anyway a disreputable British sailor managed to find a tiny nutmeg island that the Dutch hadn't claimed, called Run, which was just two miles long and half a mile wide. He excitedly claimed it for James I, and it was Britain's very first colony.

The Dutch were infuriated because it spoilt their nutmeg monopoly. So they lay siege to it, and after four years, managed to seize it from Britain.

In retaliation, Britain seized the colony of New Amsterdam in 1664, which had a population of just 2000 people.

Then the two countries argued back and forth, and in the end the Dutch, determined to keep their nutmeg monopoly, said Britain could keep New Amsterdam if they could keep Run. After all New Amsterdam was built on a horrible swamp with dreadful winters and a hostile local population, it was clearly rubbish.

We said OK and renamed New Amsterdam, New York. And that's how North America became British.

A couple of far-right guys did a march under the building where one of the main italian newspapers, La Repubblica, is located, claiming that it's supporting the ""invasion"" and ""etnical substitution"" of italians, referring to the migratory crisis from Libya and other countries that we are facing since many years, together with Greece and Malta. [Here's the La Repubblica article in italian (sorry I couldn't find any in English](http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2017/12/06/news/forza_nuova_mascherati_fumogeni_intimidazione_repubblica-183252738/?refresh_ce)

This is just the last of some events related to fascists in Italy, and in the last year there were many. We have, in fact, a lot of fascist movements and parties that are gaining much more space in the political spectrum (""Forza Nuova and ""Casa Pound"" are the biggest ones) and significant percentages in local elections. Although none of them has never win a seat in the Parliament since the death of Mussolini, it could happen that some of them are going to in 2018, just like AfD did in Germany, or Front National in France (not mentioning other countries like Austria, Poland or Hungary, of course).

Discussions in Italy we are controversial about this issue. Some say this isn't a big deal, that's just over-covered by media, and that fascists will never gain real power in Italy because people aren't supporting them, because they are not armed, and they're not trying to overthrow the system (in fact, they're trying to get elected in it). Others, instead, believe that we are underestimating the problem, that fascist movements are growing stronger mainly in big cities' suburbs and outskirts, and that in any case this is a huge problem, even if fascist won't conquer any seat, because it concerns the way that we, as italians, have dealt with fascism in the past 70 years, both politically and culturally.

I don't know which argument is true or most believable; I only fear that, whether we will elect some fascists on the Parliament or not, Italy will be Europe's main political problem in 2018 - also because of our political system, which today is even more confused and fragile than ever, with 3-4 parties where none of them has the strong majority of votes, and our electoral system that doesn't favor a strong government with 1 or at least 2 parties together (and major parties claim that they won't build a coalition in any case, although we'll really see only after elections).",,/r/europe/comments/7h8ks3/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20171203/dqv0kr9/,bubblelephant,1512583614

You can see that for example when the spanish national football team plays, people are openly patriotic, and the same thing happens in the context of culture, gastronomy etc. (and obviosuly there's nothing wrong with that). I've looked it up and statistically spaniards seem to be [about averagely patriotic](https://academic.oup.com/ijpor/article/18/1/127/797159) when compared to other countries (and that was in 2003/2004, before all the current drama that would possible change those results). I think the different treatment when dealing with politics can probably be explained because of the relative proximity of francoism (40 years ago is not that much after all, most of the population was born in the dictatorship).

I don't agree though that separatism is a recent thing though. The support for it has definitely not been always high but if you look for example at Catalonia, Esquerra Republicana, openly pro-independence, was the ruling and biggest party before the civil war and PNV was also ruling in Euskadi IIRC. In fact, one of the common justifications from the nationalist side for their coup was what they percieved as the threat of separatism.

4383,"&gt; but I think there were indicators that Saddam wanted a weapons program

But there is something to be said about another country invading someone on the suggestion that someone wants something. I'm pretty sure that wouldn't be a good defense in court, I stab someone in the ear with a knife, I did it because ""they seemed like they were plotting to kill me"". There were a million ways they could have stopped Saddam without invading the country, killing thousands on both sides and destabilizing the region. 

&gt; Ok, that's an almost painful oversimplification of the political and religious history of the region.

Not that much of an oversimplification. There was 1 thing which Saddam did well and that was quash rebellions and keep the peace in his own country. Not supporting him, I don't think he was an amazing leader but he was able to hold his own even in a complex situation. 

&gt; Its not like the US turned anything approaching a profit in these regions. Its a massive money sink. Also selling weapons to whom? That doesn't really generate any money for the US either, given the expense of production and transport.

Well it's profit for someone. Not the US government but for sure the people who make the guns, PMCs and maybe oil prices in general. 

&gt; Look up the training that green berets get and then look up the training irish special forces get.

Don't need to look up what the Irish do, I lived 4km from one of the biggest bases in the country. Didn't sit in on training but I knew quite a few people who went through their training, it wasn't some walk in the park. It's different to the green berets but not wrong.

Stronger together until somebody gets cold feet about the rapid pace of political integration. Then the barrel comes out.

The EU was supposed to be run for the benefit of Europe as a whole, these days its run for the benefit of the EU as a political entity instead.

&gt;Nearly every economist advised against this so dont blame it on the EU when it eventually bites Britain in the rear.

Seeing economics as the be-all and end-all of politics is what got us into this mess in the first place. The vote for Brexit was ultimately a vote to give the establishment a kick in the bollocks, centralising our economy in London and specialising it as part of the EU was good for our economy but it ultimately created a huge divide within the UK and left a wave of deprivation in its wake. I'm no bleeding-heart socialist but seeing some of the towns in the UK is it really surprising that given one shot to hit the establishment where it hurt they took it?

&gt;  Sniečkus was the initiator of the first mass deportations of Lithuanians on 14–19 June 1941. He even had his own brother, with his family, deported to Siberia, where his brother died.

But

&gt;  During the later decades of Sniečkus's rule national orientation was noticeable in his activities. First confrontation with Moscow happened in 1949-1950, when he had to defend his old communist friends from persecution, with whom he was together working in underground. Lithuania was the only republic of USSR where not only mass persecution of old communists did not happen and not even one communist of pre-Soviet times was accused and arrested. At around this time his policies started to gain a national character. This policy had the form of sabotaging some orders of Moscow, demanding some privileges for Lithuania, and others.

My country is low and that's not because we are not fertile, its because we dont want to be bothered. being a mom offers you nothing here, more like a no career future and outdated traditional role in many cases. No wonder many women dont want to bother. So its better to give them equal rights and to encourage more men to stay home with kids on paternity leave too, give young couples more opportunities, more economical stability. Maybe it works in Denmark already, but in Slovakia (or Poland, because I am sure they have families abroad, especially in UK), hah we are too catholic or old traditional for that. Many young university graduates just give up, immigrate or just have one kid as that's easier, with no intentions of ever having another.

4570,"The Southwestern Finnish dialects have historically been at more contact with Estonians as the Finnish south coast wasn't that densely inhabited and the economic center was at Turku. And yes, it seems quite a common understanding that these dialects have been influenced by Estonian.

Remember that Finland is more to the north, so its nature has been historically even less forgiving than Estonia's, especially due to the rocky geology. Therefore Estonia's population was always larger. Remember, Finnic people didn't travel from Finland to Estonia, but from southeast to northwest, splitting at the gulf.

But Finland got warmer, new technologies allowed more people to live off that land, and Estonia got into some nasty famines, wars and plagues, decimating much of the population.

The Finnish Estonia-oriented historian Seppo Zetterberg puts the historical populations like that:

Active conscription itself in peacetime is also kind of bullshit and better done via taxes which go to the army. The real reason Finnish conscription exists is ""to make men out of boys""  and instill patriotism into them instead of a real practical reason.

The legend continues, that he then ordered that the whole shipment of potatoes be unloaded on public display on the docks of Nafplion, and placed it under guard to make the people believe that they were valuable. Soon, people would gather to look at the guarded potatoes and some started to steal them. The guards had been ordered in advance to turn a blind eye to such behaviour, and soon the potatoes had all been ""stolen"" and Kapodistrias' plan to introduce them to Greece had succeeded.""

4830,"You know what I would like to see? 

Having this money invested in the actual infrastructure of Europe. I don't want to think about how schools and streets look in even poorer nations, but in Germany I literally have to drive through streets with giant holes and bumps where I fear that everything breaks. In my old school they cleaned the floor daily, however the tables and everything else if at most once a year, most likely less. We once made a test and wrote something on a table with non-waterproof marker and it was still there after 3 years, probably still there now. 

In my new school as part of my apprenticeship, they don't even clean. I sometimes have weird timings for my classes and I've never seen anyone cleaning. The sport hall is so dusty that you literally slide across the ground. The keyboards are disgusting and the floor is the only thing somewhat clean. There are leftovers stuffed in the connection boxes under the tables. On the first day, nobody wanted to touch the keyboards and I still don't, because they look worse than my uncleaned 5 year old keyboard. 

The hardware is even worse with 4:3 640p maybe 12"" displays and PCs with stuff I've forgotten it existed. Windows 7 takes 5 minutes to be able to login. 

But hey,, they just got money. They should invest now, right? 

Wrong. My old school gets new windows they don't even need, for 600k. To combat ""unnecessary heating"" for our environment©. No wonder 1% of my year just straight up left and went to the USA. 

But streets are okay, right? No. Holes and bumps that are probably illegal, the Autobahn I take home recently got demoted to a one-lane Autobahn, but it's literally the only one going south from that city. Some kind of construction, but there are neither workers nor materials nor any kind of vehicles. They just up and blocked lanes.

4853,"&gt;Denouncing the West as godless and decadent is a venerable tradition in Russian Orthodoxy with deep historical roots, and it’s been reborn after Communism with gusto. Patriarch Kirill, the head of the ROC, frequently breathes fire on post-modern Western ways, and a couple weeks back he shared them with John Huntsman, the newly arrived American ambassador in Moscow, in an awkward meet-and-greet that turned into a theology lecture.
&gt;
&gt;Simply put, Kirill explained, America today is doing to itself what the Bolsheviks did to Russia: forcing a godless, secular ideology onto society. “Christian values are being destroyed… The West is abandoning God, but Russia is not abandoning God, like the majority of people in the world. That means the distance between our values is increasing,” he stated bluntly. Kirill’s insistence that America and the West are the outliers here, with Russia and most of the world on the side of traditional religion and values, is an important point that merits pondering.

Hmm.

Vlad Dracul II was a Wallach voivod that swapped sides between the Ottomans, Hungarians, and Hapsburgs. He was eventually forced to give two of his sons to the Ottomans to ensure his loyalty. One of those sons was Vlad Dracul III (the other was Radu), famously known as a ""Vlad the Impaler"". As ruler of Wallachia with Ottoman support, he was killed by John Hunyadi's men. The word dracul means ""dragon"" in Latin and was a crusading order known as ""Order of the Dragon"". It was given to Vlad Dracul II in Germany.

Estonia isn't a part of Fennoscandia, nor is Iceland. If you mean Nordics + Estonia, Denmark has given Finland fewer points.

You should also compare averages rather than total votes because Finland, Sweden and Norway took part about 30 times together before Estonia debuted. That's quite a handicap. Also, after Estonia debuted, Finland has only been in the final roughly once every two years because of the relegations and semifinals.

4906,"When you actually read the studies and metastudies concerning this topic, you'll realize that there is no real even remotely conclusive evidence for glyphosate being carcinogenic.

That doesn't mean that we shouldn't be careful with it's use and approval, but there just is as of yet no valid evidence to ban it due to health concerns.

There are FAR worse pesticides and insecticides in use with conclusively proven hazardous to health and environment.
Why not focus on banning those?

Now granted, it's not just laymen and environmentalists that sometimes panic to easily about something being carcinogenic without hard proof. 

Scientists can be prone to it too.

(see e.g. Ethidium Bromide, an DNA dye. Villified to such an extent that it has been largely replaced in most labs, without any evidence of its cancerogenicity. In fact, all that peer reviewed studies over the last 46 years managed to turn up was a slight anti-tumorogenic effect, and a anti-parasitological effect.)

Furthermore, virtually no modern farmers reuse seeds from a previous harvest anyway. It's just not done. Almost all modern crops are F1-Hybrids, a first generation cross between different ""breeds"" of the same plant. They usually selected because they produce higher yields, higher pest resistance, and higher tolerance towards the soil type.

Reusing seeds obtained from planting F1-Hybrids, (F2-generational seeds) would lead to inconsistent yields, due to some of the desired genes beeing lost, or their contained twice instead of once.

Furthermore, glyphosate has a half life of under 50 days under normal conditions (you know, unless you're e.g. in Scandinavia, where the colder climate slows things down), which means that you are NOT bound to glyphosate resistant crops forever, but just for approximately 200 days after you last used it on that field.

Which means that in most cases you could plant non-glyphosate resistant crops the next spring without problems.

So definitively not forever.",Europe (Germany),/r/europe/comments/7hqthf/macron_becomes_the_first_french_president_to/dqu4zsz/,Metalmind123,1512532840

In fact the populations with far higher unemployment rates have on average substantially higher birth rates. That's true within Germany itself as well as on a global scale.

It's so obvious to me that unemployment or financial aspects can't explain away the low birth rates. It the cultural attitudes at large that are responsible. Of course it wouldn't be politically correct to address the real issues responsible for this and people would cry and lament and socially ostracize the person doing so. All I'm going to say is that the substantial change in societal roles between men and women over the past 100 years in the Western world are largely responsible for this.

5257,"&gt; But what you say its true,living near the border of both Romania and Serbia has made me appreciate how similar we all actually are.

While this is true, it can also make you overestimate how much people have in common.

Romania - like all countries, I presume - has an overarching culture that's more or less common to the whole country but on top of that are a number of subtler cultural elements that are often more common to the geographic vicinity than necessarily the political one. I.e. a romanian from Calafat will have a lot in common with a bulgarian from Vidin, naturally, but one from Sighetu Marmatiei might have more in common with an ukrainian from Solotvyno...

But yes, overall, I do think Bulgaria is the neighbour we have the most in common with after Moldova.","Nomad, but was Romania",/r/europe/comments/7hjhbz/what_do_you_know_about_romania/dqtlt8l/,slacker25,1512511220

Surprisingly, in Poland, a country where you can find vegetarian pierogi fried in pork fat served as a vegetarian dish, the most important meal on Christmas, which is the Christmas Eve dinner, is traditionally meat-free. Dishes that are served are based on various fish, mushrooms, cabbage, poppy seed, root vegetables etc. When I was a child you were not supposed to eat meat at all on 24th Dec. I remember waiting with my dad till midnight to start on all those delicious meats that were prepared for 1st and 2nd day of Christmas. Although now it's ok to eat meat on Christmas Eve, still many prefer to keep it traditional and stick to meat-less dishes.

As for the better option - pork is delicious, but I prefer duck for 1st&amp;2nd day of Christmas. Roast pork chop in marjoram is also amazing.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/7hjhbz/what_do_you_know_about_romania/dqt6vya/,siewka,1512497168

The kind of experimentation that would require funding from the government, not from the natives, as their research project with the additional benefit of the natives learning how to operate hydroponic farms and getting food from there. 

This kind of research is what is beneficial in the long run, as such technology could be of use in general on earth in harsh climates, in space exploration and in colonization of other planets. An effort that will pay off after several generations, but that's actually the reason why noone wants to do it.

Hydroponic farms could be useful not just in arctic climate, but anywhere where regular farming is not an option, like deserts, areas in danger of longer period droughts, areas with subterranean housing (a niche category but these actually exist, in Australia there's towns where miners live in underground housing, or rather in housing built inside a mountain, because the heat is just too harsh there).

5653,"&gt; The easiest solution would be for the UK to remain in the Common market

That means cancelling Brexit. Neither the UK staying in the single market, or Ireland leaving it, are solutions. They are fantasies. 

&gt;More difficult paths involve rewriting the GFA, which would be a political minefield. If the UK violates the GFA not even 20 years after it was written, how would that impact our reputation to keep to our word?

Many agreements don't last 20 years. Previous parliaments cannot force future parliaments to comply with their wishes. If we have to rewrite the GFA then we will do that. The Republicans in NI are far *more* against putting a border in the Irish sea than the Unionists are. There is no reason for the troubles to begin again since all sides agreed that NI will remain part of the UK until the majority of people decide otherwise. Terrorists cannot force us to leave the UK against our will. If that means they have to accept a hard border forced on us by the EU and Ireland, then so be it.

&gt;If we do give Northern Ireland that privilege, and the EU accepts that, what would stop Gibraltar from being the next to ask seeing as they also border an EU state.

Gibraltar is not in the customs union right now, even though the UK is. Why would they seek to join it after Brexit? 

&gt;They'd have to get through multiple countries to get here and most of these countries have sealed their borders with their southern neighbour.

Greece can give them all EU citizenship, and then they are free to move to the UK so long as it remains in the single market. We cannot take that risk. You think the refugees living in Germany right now will never be given German citizenship? It was estimated 2-400,000 of them would eventually move to the UK if we stayed in the EU. So long as the EU allows individual member states the undemocratic power to destroy all of the other member states against their will, being a member is not worth it. Even if it harms our economy to leave, insurance always has a cost. Remaining a liberal democracy requires controlling your own borders.

And whoever gave them those orders should be held accountable for his/her choices then. There are other more safer tools to dispel protestors. It's not like this is the first time rubber bullets caused injuries like this. That's why they are not commonly used in the first place. 

Obviously not all the protestors acted in a peaceful way, but the police should be professionals and should be able to handle such situations without causing pernament body damage to anyone.

Of course accidents happen. Sometimes the police pushes people and they fall in an unfortunate way, hit their head or fall on something sharp. Sometimes the police charge against a crowd, creates a panic, some people fall down and are crushed by the others.

5706,"&gt; An independent Scotland would have to leave the EU. That's been established especially with Catalonia this year.

Not really. ""Can a state that becomes *legitimately* independent of an EU state also enter the EU?"" has about the same level of certainty as ""Can A50 be retracted?""; there's not a tested legal process around it.  But if it were requested, and if the EU member states wanted it, it would likely be allowed.

Catalonia doesn't count as it is not *legitimately* independent. Scotland's entry to the EU in 2014 if it had become independent could've been more like Greenland entering the EC in 1979 when it gained home rule from Denmark (before then choosing to leave in 1985).

However, the 2017 position, where the UK is trying to leave and a potentially independent future Scotland would want to join, is that [Scotland can't ""inherit"" the UK's membership (because the UK is leaving) and would have to apply independently (which could take years)](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/14/spain-independent-scotland-would-be-at-the-back-of-eu-queue), but [Spain wouldn't block that application if Scotland gained its independence legitimately](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/02/spain-drops-plan-to-impose-veto-if-scotland-tries-to-join-eu).

&gt; that polls have actually shown a drop in support for Scottish independence even after Brexit

That's true, but I think it's partly an acceptance of the 2014 result, and - this year - reflects the anti-indyref2 sentiment provoked by unionist parties as they were differentiating themselves from the SNP to try and gain seats in the 2017 UK elections. If Brexit actually happens, you could just as easily see the SNP whipping up anti-Brexit-reality sentiment. They're currently biding their time and not especially antagonising the process, because they want the UK government to totally shut down all avenues and tell them to fuck off and shut up, so they eventually get to say 'we tried all the legitimate routes, they were blocked by Westminster, here's indyref2'.",,/r/europe/comments/7hhoun/the_yellow_areas_voted_remain_so_they_will/dqsokxx/,kyz,1512474993

The outcome of the referendum was not mandatory, the government could have used it just as an argument to change their position in the EU, it was mainly just keeping to one's word that they'll do as the people wish, and also not to look like idiots that are not acting on behalf of the people if they broke their promise of acting accordingly to the referendum even though they weren't bound by any laws to do so. So in the end people had very little say in the matter, or rather they're led to believe the illusion that they did.

""not directly"", just like any kind of politics in every country, every district, every single little town. The voted representatives do the decisions and act on them.

""the middleman"" is your own government and the whole system of democracy. 

The politicians in charge of the main town of your larger administrative unit, your canton or whatever, already give literally 0 fucks about you and ""the people"" unless it's the elections time again. There is no ""will of the people"" past the smallest of towns, let alone a whole country or the EU. There never was, there's only the representatives of the people, be it the town hall, the district, the state, the EU, and they're the ones that are supposed to voice the people that voted for them. That's the point of these representatives, to be the people that voice the consensus of a larger mass of people that share a common view, so that noone has to drive around the town all day every day to ask every single person in the state what is their view on the matter (the matter they might not even understand or care about or care about politics in general)

I think Klaver could hold appeal to them since where else are they going to go? To the right there's only the VVD and  the CDA.

Anecdotally I made the mistake of voting for D66 once and then they joined Balkenende-II and promptly got rolled on all their major issued; for me that was a reason to move back to the left a bit, not to move to the right.

By David Filipov December 5 at 4:11 AM 
MOSCOW — Russia on Tuesday named Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and seven affiliated news services as foreign agents, in retaliation for similar U.S. moves against the English-language Russian network RT.

The Justice Ministry published a list of nine outlets, which includes Russian-language subsidiaries of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that cover the Caucasus region of Russia, Crimea, Siberia, and two predominantly Muslim regions in central Russia, Tatarstan and Bashkortostan. The ban also includes Current Time TV, which is produced by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Factograph a website produced by Radio Liberty.

The move comes in response to a U.S. Justice Department requirement that RT, previously known as Russia Today, register as a foreign agent under a 1938 law because of its alleged role in interfering in U.S. affairs and the 2016 presidential election by pushing the Kremlin’s agenda. Russia denies it meddled in the election campaign.

[Russian legislators pass law targeting international media as ‘foreign agents’]

Congress has also revoked the accreditation of RT, prompting the Russian lower house of parliament, the State Duma, to consider a ban of U.S. media. On Monday, a Duma committee moved to propose that any U.S. media named foreign agents be banned from attending its sessions. It is scheduled to vote on the resolution Wednesday.

On Tuesday, Sergei Popov, deputy head of the rules committee for Russia’s upper house, the Federation Council, said the body could also ban media designated foreign agents.

The ministry statement did not mention any specific restrictions on the media outlets. Russia’s law on foreign agents, which in the past has been used on nongovernmental organizations critical of the Kremlin, requires the organizations to label their publications as coming from a foreign agent. The Russian government recently designated a union of truckers protesting highway tolls as a foreign agent.

A bill extending that law to media organizations sailed through both houses before President Vladi­mir Putin signed it last month. 

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty quoted its president, Thomas Kent, as saying he had received no details of what the foreign agent designation would mean. 

“Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is a journalism company engaged in professional news coverage of Russia and other countries,” Kent said. “We remain committed to accurate and comprehensive journalism.” 

Voice of America and Radio Free Europe were originally created during the Cold War to broadcast news to the closed societies of the Soviet Union and the Communist countries in its orbit.

Russia charges that the U.S. designation of RT as a foreign agent and the removal of its accreditation by Congress constitutes an unprovoked attack on free speech. 

“We didn’t start this theater of the absurd,” Maria Zakharova, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said at a Duma hearing on Tuesday. “But we have to respond to it.”",,/r/europe/comments/7hos3p/russia_names_radio_free_europe_and_voice_of/dqsm62a/,vilnius2013,1512468772

5975,"Not surprised. Although we never learned the specifics of this deal, if it meant some sort of border between NI and GB, that would have been a bad thing. It would hinder trade with NI's biggest markets (GB and it's trade with mainland europe, which goes through GB), and worst of all for the unionist side of the community it would have meant distancing NI from the rest of its own country. So in that respect it's very fortunate the DUP have leverage over the UK government. Just as those concerned about the NI-roI border have the Irish gov't and EU representing their interests, those concerned about the NI-GB link have the DUP representing their interests, and all is equal. If the UK gov't had ignored the opinions of some in NI to impose a border on the Irish sea, that would have led to a lot of outrage.

It also seems bizarre to me that people suggest NI could enjoy a privileged position by being in both the UK and the customs union, acting as a gateway to the UK for trade from Europe. That ignores how this trade physically travels. A shipment that currently goes from Calais to Dover by ferry and into somewhere in the South of England (the most likely destination, considering population density) is not going to make a massive detour around GB, take a longer ferry to Ireland, travel up to NI, across to Scotland and down through England just to avoid customs at Dover. That would surely add two days onto the journey, which is unviable for perishable goods, and probably longer than they would be waiting at customs. Maybe the idea has merit for services or placement of company head offices, but I don't see the benefits for trade.",,/r/europe/comments/7hi9lt/uk_and_eu_fail_to_strike_brexit_talks_deal/dqsjlu8/,Dardanator,1512461938
