6,"&gt; There is no stealing. It's obvious to everyone with a brain that islands should have at least equal rights to the sea as they are more dependent on it than the mainland (yes, even the coastal mainland).

This is literally putting a bunch of animals and telling them to climb a tree. It is ""fair"" and ""equal"" right? Except some animals are monkey, some are fish and some are elephants. You are not asking for fair eez you are wanting to TAKE THEM ALL. Just because you have a 12km2 island 1-2 km away from mainland doesnt mean you can take it all. This is absolutely unfair, i am sure you know the caricature I mentioned. 

&gt;Spain sees no benefit in expanding them, it's not a concern of it will look fair due to the size of their land. It's funny how it's now a silent understanding, when you started you treated like case law.

If both parties do not object they tacitly agree. In the future Spain may take it to the court, doesnt change the reality on the ground where intl courts always ruled in favor of the mainland. 

&gt;In case you do not understand there is no silence with Turkey. You are trying to exploit areas that are much closer to Greek islands or Cyprus than your lands. So no understanding.


Yes, how dare we try to exploit the area that is projected by our own mainland where millions live compared to a tiny greek island outpost. 

&gt;Things are already happening. Turkey is sending ships in waters that should by all means be exploited by Cyprus. Cyprus is of course selling rights in what should rightly be it's EEZ.

Cyprus issue is different. I wont discuss it here. We are talking about the eez claimed by you. 

&gt;Turkey has tried some forceful action against some of those ships. We will see if Turkey really has as much more hard power as it thinks.

Particularly if they were willing to begin the process of federalising the country and allows the constituent nations to have more devolved government. Like I said, I would compromise.

Brexit is the reason I support independence. I voted for Labour in the election a month ago. I also voted against Scottish independence in 2014. I just don't want Scotland to be pulled out of the EU by a contemptuous inward looking right wing government.

I don't know whether you struggle to get this through your head or whether you're ignoring this point on purpose to fit your argument, but this is exactly what Brexit is. I would like Scotland be opening ourselves back up to the EU, like the vast majority of Scots voted for.

I don't base my support for independence on ""empty promises of a future prosperous nation"". I base it on wanting to be a normal nation that makes it's own decisions.

My thought is that **a governments sole purpose is to look after its people’s interests.**

&gt; independence of Ukraine had not much sense, as they are much poorer, than if they staid part of Russia

So the Ukrainian government’s job is to look after only its citizens interests. You say if Ukraine  stayed a part of Russia they would have more money. Debatable but sure. But is it in the interest of the Ukrainian individual to want to be a part of Russia? Most Ukrainians that don’t have a Russian background would say no. Thus, the people’s interest is not to be a part of Russia so the governments purpose in this relation is to not be a part of Russia. 

&gt; independence of Poland is doubtful. As German state they would be richer and live longer

Again the polish government’s purpose is to provide for the Polish people’s interests. So you could argue yes the polish people may be richer and live longer in a German system. But this does not necessarily equate to the polish people’s interest. The Polish people can have interest in things that are not necessarily always straight forward. And the Polish government is still obligated to look out for the Polish individuals interests. 

&gt; going for a war makes often no sense for countries

Beyond these there looks to be divisions within the main island with walls and gate houses that make it harder for an attack force to progress further. Then there’s the main castle itself which should be very defensible because it obviously will be. 

So I think that with all the murderholes, meticulations, moats, draw bridges and general funnelling of attackers into a smaller area for easy killing will make this castle a lot more defensible than any others. If it had the front keep and exterior wall like on the bottom right then it would be an incredibly difficult castle to attack and conquer. Especially because catapults and even trebuchets won’t be able to bombard the castle due to the sheer length of defences.

539,"&gt; No, that may be your strategy but Greek claims are not bullshit.

Of course since you are not the one living in that coast 

&gt;Please give us the names of these Turkish islands to the west of Kastelorizo, not to the Northwest, to the west. There is Turkish land directly to the east of Kastelorizo but it is to the north of Strogylli. 

36.180433, 29.446765. Not to mention Greece counts Ro and Strogglu to their EEZ projection despite they being depopulated

&gt;We are not screwing anybody's rights. It's ridiculous to argue that a significant amount of Turks living in the mainland have a job in the Mediterranean sea 'behind' Greek islands.

And what exactly are you doing to the sea directly to the south of turkey??? You are taking the fishing rights of all turkish fisherman and of course drilling rights. 500 people vs 5 million population. 

&gt;No according to UNCLOS Canada's EEZ would surround Micelos' EEZ. Because Canada's land extends Southernmost of the French islands in a distance where that EEZ would meet the French EEZ.

Are you blind? There is canada to the east and north. Nova Scotia is already far away in the west. And there is nothing to do south.. France claimed median line for everything which resulted in extrvagant claims thats why they only got 17% of what they claimed. A clear case of mainland being favored to islands.

&gt;Every instance? It's 3 nitpicked cases and none really support your argument. Only Colombia was judged on just continental shelf because Colombia (which owned the islands and wanted to get them an EEZ) was not a party to UNCLOS.

Of course the situations will be slightly different, world is not a carbon copy of one thing but in EVERY instance MAINLAND WAS FAVORED. Stealing 20kmsquare with 492 population as an 12km2 island which is pathetic. The mainland has far more population and far bigger size/coastline and gets MUCH LESS eez this is UNACCEPTABLE.

Page 21 look at Italian islands and Tunisia, they only have the surrounding waters, as it should be. And they are much closer to Italian mainland that Kastellorizo is to the Greek mainland. This is ICJ ruling btw. The ruling that Greece runs away from and relies on itnernational pressute because they know they cannot win.

https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/120

Nicaragua and Honduras, just like Nicaragua and Colombia islands have limited eez around them and everything else goes to mainland. 

&gt;Colombia (which owned the islands and wanted to get them an EEZ) was not a party to UNCLOS.

Seriously? Turkey is also not a party yet you try to hammer it down to turkey. 

&gt;Spain and Morroco have simply not actually resolved their EEZ at all yet you used them as an example!

They have a silent understanding and do not escalate the issue. This is whats necessary. Spain does not pursue aggressively expanding their eez just because they own tiny pecks of land(which are MUCH bigger and MUCH MORE populated than meis mind you)

582,"What changes to look out for in each phase.

882 AD: Stone fortresses are still rare. In the centuries immediately following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the use of stone in architecture declined. Wood became the primary building material.

980 AD: The stone tower is the most prominent development. While it has defensive purposes, it is also the home of the lord of the castle. These towers usually had one main room on each floor and maybe three floors. Other notable changes are the draw bridge and the stone tower at the gate.

1125: Rather impressive structure. What was previously a single bloc now has four separate towers. Thre is also move toward circular towers. The wooden walls are replaced by stone walls which still don't have towers. Some parts of the walls have a wooden structure constructed on top to allow better defence for archers.

1215: Lots of big changes. My favorite development is the use of walls to create separate zones within the castle. This was so that even if the enemy brakes through a wall the defenders can fall back to a second line of defense. These zones were also designed to be a trap for the besiegers. In these zones the defenders could keep the enemy under fire from almost all directions. The walls, which now have towers are also considerably taller.

1428: The main structure saw less change in the past two centuries but the caslte now has a second wall. The most important change is the thickness of the walls. The outer wall, which is newer is much lower and thicker. This is in part thanks to the use of cannons in warfare. Europeans began using early cannons around the  turn of the 13th and 14th centuries. While early cannons were rather ineffective, by 1428 cannons posed considerable danger to fortresses. As seen in the picture, cannons are also used by the defenders. They are placed in a low circular wall that allowes the artillery crews to easily survey the area.

1535: The fortress is barely recognizable. What was once a proud symbol of powerful family's status and influence is now relegated to a military facility. However, the changes were necessary. The tall and narrow walls of past centuries were useful in the pre-gunpowder years. But they were far to weak against modern cannons. It is often argued that by the 16th century sieges were the primary form of warfare. Artillery fortresses such as the one depicted were designed to withstand a prolonged siege. The walls are now also buildings that allow the defenders a greater use of the walls surface such as with the many small windows that provide a safe position for riflemen. Virtually none of the inner structures are taller than the walls since the defenders don't want to expose the structures to cannon fire. The lower walls defending the gate were built on mounds. They were ideal for absorbing cannon fire. The star shaped wall design was developed in Southern Europe and were soon adopted throughout the continent. In fact most North American fortresses follow have a similar shape.",,/r/europe/comments/epyj7d/an_interesting_look_at_how_european_castles_have/fep9khs/,hk96hu,1579315198

This just reeks of Turkish propaganda tbh. It's a lie you guys keep repeating to yourselves in order to legitimize your occupation because God forbid you guys admit that you're the baddies. Doesn't matter if literally every other country in the world calls you out on it, you just go ""LALALALALA YOU LIE, IM GOOD"". 

After what happened the last time with Cyprus losing almost half its land, what makes you think there would be hostilities again? To what end? Whom would it benefit? Why would anyone risk the same shit all over again. Also the Enosis idea is long dead. Cyprus is an independent sovereign nation and Greece is fine with that. Turkey knows that but it keeps feeding you guys the same ""the Greeks will kill again"" shit in order to keep support for the illegal occupation. Please stop saying that, it's just wrong. 

&gt;And from our perspective YOUR actions in the region are the provocative ones and that makes Turkeys role as guarantor state in cyprus a legitimate role.

Turkey's role as a guarantor power never included Turkey occupying the island itself and settling it with Turks. Turkey was only allowed to intervene. It did a lot more than that. Greece started it with the Junta, no arguments there, no one denies it, but Turkey's actions in it's second invasion of the island are not justified by anything and that's why no country recognises the TRNC and they all agree that Turkey is occupying illegally. You legit can't use Greece's actions in order to legitimize an occupation. That's like stopping some burglar from killing your neighbour's wife, and then going in her house and raping her and acting like it's ok cause you stopped the burglar from killing her.

&gt;As long as a guarantor is needed it should stay there, not the other way around.. Not saying ""ok you can go now"" while trying to isolate Turkey in geopolitics, trying to make the world think we are the baddies when you want 12nm borders in the aegean sea.

Only you see yourselves as a guarantor atm. Everyone else agrees you're an occupier. There's a difference, you just choose to ignore it. The only thing Turkey guarantees right now is its occupation of another country's land.

Turkey has successfully isolated itself in geopolitics thanks to its own actions. Occupying Cyprus, drilling inside its EEZ etc. 

Sure we want 12 nm in the Aegean. Why wouldn't we. You'd want them too in our place. You just don't like it cause the islands are ours and not yours.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/epntdp/greek_pm_says_he_will_veto_any_solution_on_libya/feoay7g/,Divide-By-Zero88,1579297571

720,"I'd say that the peak of the British Empire was in the very late 1800s.  At that point, there was still no serious political instability present, and the British Empire had expanded to its full size.

My understanding is that the processes that produced the breakup really hit critical mass after World War I.  While I see World War II often blamed by Brits on here, and it didn't *help*, it was more of a last hurrah of something that was already losing cohesion.

I'd call the interwar period the important bit.  I've seen a claim that India's independence had probably become unavoidable by the mid-1930s.  Maybe it could be delayed or slowed a bit, but...

Here's a timeline of [Canadian independence](https://jjmccullough.com/timeline.htm) (not that Canada was essential to the Empire's clout, but it illustrates the fragmentation process in the ""white"" British Empire), and here's a [history of Indian independence between 1900 and 1947](https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/india-1900-to-1947/).  Without India, a lot of the Empire didn't have reason or funds to exist, so I understand it to be something of a keystone of the late-era British Empire.

Certainly after India left, it'd be unreasonable to call the UK as at the top, so by 1947, the UK is out of the top tier.  I'd personally place it earlier.

Also, while the UK was top-tier, if we're going to be strictly about #1, I'd say that it was sometime after the start of World War I.

Defining ""#1"" can mean a lot of things.  Do they have influence over critical geography?  Can they project military power?  What kind of economic clout do they have?

The US's GDP apparently [bypassed the GDP of the British Empire in 1916](https://www.quora.com/When-did-the-GDP-of-the-United-States-exceed-the-GDP-of-the-entire-British-Empire-not-just-the-UK):

&gt; When did the GDP of the United States exceed the GDP of the entire British Empire (not just the UK?)
&gt;
&gt; According to Angus Maddison’s database, it was in 1916, during the First World War.
&gt;
&gt;The US GDP pulled a little ahead of the British Empire in subsequent years, but the gap didn’t widen significantly until the late 1930s. Then during the Second World War US GDP doubled and Britain’s didn’t.
&gt;
&gt;1900: BE $395 billion, US $312 billion
&gt;
&gt;1916: BE $554 billion, US $559 billion
&gt;
&gt;1938: BE $678 billion, US $799 billion
&gt;
&gt;1944: BE $804 billion, US $1714 billion
&gt;
&gt;Note that British India’s GDP in 1946 was $258 billion, so about one third of the British Empire total.
&gt;
&gt;All values in 1990 US$.

So if we're using economic clout, I'd say that World War I was a bookend on the #1 status, though certainly the British Empire continued to be a top-tier power into the interwar period.

I don't know what size land armies the Brits could raise if need be, since I understand that normally they didn't rely on doing so -- they could just use blockade, and that was a potent-enough lever to work in most cases.

In World War I, Germany and the UK were the top naval powers in the world, with the UK having a significant edge.  By the start of World War II, the UK and the US were the largest naval powers and, under the Washington Naval Treaty, about equal in extant naval forces, though the US did massive production during the war and by the end, the US Navy was larger than all of the other combined navies in the world.

The USSR didn't *exist* in its full Cold War form until after World War II, and immediately-subsequent to World War II was also the point where India was clearly fully-independent.

So I'd say that it would be fair to say that the British Empire was the preeminent world power up until World War I.  By various metrics, the US would bypass it between then and the end of World War II.  Shortly after World War II, the British Empire largely deflated and the USSR grew and became the other really large power, so the UK was basically out of the top tier at that point.

I'm less familiar with the rise of the British Empire, haven't read much about it, so I don't know when the point was that one could say that the British Empire became the world's largest power.

The Seven Years War enhanced the power of the British Empire versus the French Empire, so that might be the point at which the Brits really clearly became #1:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_in_the_Seven_Years%27_War

&gt; Great Britain was one of the major participants in the Seven Years' War which lasted between 1754 and 1763, although warfare in the European Theatre involving countries other than Britain and France only commenced in 1756 (hence the name ""Seven Years' War""). Britain emerged from the war as the world's leading colonial power, having gained a number of new territories at the Treaty of Paris in 1763 and established itself as the world's pre-eminent naval power.

But I'm not sure whether it'd be fair to say that the French were more-powerful prior to that war, just that this was a significant shift towards the British.

So maybe it'd be fair to say that the Brits were the #1 world power for the 153 years between 1763 and 1916.  You could maybe extend each end a bit depending upon how one measures things; I don't know whether people would give an edge to the British versus the French prior to 1763, and some might extend the British period into the interwar era.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/eq4cpj/poll_of_british_adults_asking_them_how_theyd_rank/feoc88v/,duisThias,1579298157

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Oh for fucks sake, England has a much larger population and therefore if they vote for something in large enough numbers, Scotland's voice goes unheard. I don't support right wing governments, which is what I meant by ""saddles us"", because they chose a Tory government in December, which is against the vast majority of Scots' wishes.

I don't even know how is that an argument for independence. Should greater London become independent because it didn't vote Tory either? Would you expect a future Scotland having regional tensions because of the majorities in each region in a national parliament elections?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is just stupid, mate. Obviously some Scottish people voted for Brexit, but the vast majority didn't. In your previous comments you talked about the idea of ""50% + 1"", Scotland voted 62% against Brexit. That is an overwhelming majority.  
&gt;  
&gt;London is a city in England, Scotland is a country of its own.

That's not even 2/3s, pal. You had close to 40% of your population wanting to go for Brexit.

&gt;You're the only one here that keeps mentioning this idea of ""holding Scotland back"", which is why it's obvious you're determined to be against Scottish independence, without letting facts get in the way. I don't think the UK is ""stopping our progress"". I just believe we are on a different political path to England and therefore should become an independent nation.

So more tribalism, then.

&gt;Honestly, this is laughable. I've not once said that we're being ""held down"" or anything. I'm not pretending Scotland is some incredible country that just needs to be free of England to become great. That's you that's imagining me saying that.

Funny that you say that when you say it in your very same post. Or just here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/eojyjg/scottish\_independence\_uk\_government\_rejects/fejco49/](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/eojyjg/scottish_independence_uk_government_rejects/fejco49/)

Yeah, you said that you are in a bad position because England is stopping you. Forgetting that Scotland is also to blame.

&gt;Referendums are literally the most direct form of democracy you can have. I know Spanish nationalists like yourself believe that compromising on democracy is sending the police in to beat up civilians, so I don't expect you to agree with that.

Yeah, a democratic system that reduces down complexes issues with multiple wants to a mere answer of Yes or No. Surely, nothing can wrong with that.

Maybe it was democratic when the population was a few thousands like back in Athens, but nowadays is just a recipe for disaster when it comes to put important decisions. It just leads to polarization and removes the room for compromise.

That's why you will only see the most incompetent politicians (like your former Prime Minister and the average pro-independence party member) use that. Because instead of doing their jobs that consist in putting together different ideas and wants and try to reach a compromise, it just splits the population and will leave almost everyone unsatisfied when it comes to issues like this.

But as a nationalist that desperately needs something get their desired independent nation, I don't expect you to even understand the situation you are currently living with the Brexit, let alone look beyond that.

&gt;Repeating the word 'tribalism' doesn't make it tribalism, for a start. Scotland is a nation like England, like Spain, like France, like Germany, or like any other nation. It is not tribalism to want Scotland to be in charge of it's own future and it's own government. It is literally just about a nation being a nation. Brexit means the UK becoming an inward-looking nation that is turning it's back on Europe. I would like Scotland to have independence so that it can be open to our neighbours once again.

No, this is outright tribalism. The only justification for you being a nation is that you are an ethnic nation, because you clearly haven't been a political nation (a State) in several centuries. And the only justification you being an ethnic nation is searching for a few distinctions that you can group some people in your region after.

Instead of looking at the rights of the people, the political nation, you are desperately trying to justify yourself as separate nation from the rest of the United Kingdom with the basis of some cultural differences and an historical background that goes back beyond the romanticism and the idea of nations themselves.

&gt;The argument for independence is simple: a nation's default position is independence.

One has to wonder why would you even be interested in the European project with that attitude, or why we would even want you in when you would just be like the UK: a thorn in the ass because you need to keep defending your flag over the actual benefit of the citizens of the Union.

Trabalist nationalists have nothing to add to the integration project of the Union.

But yeah, this is getting tiresome with all your repetitions and non-arguments, so you can go back and have fun with the consequences of your 'most direct form of democracy'.

Data transmission: lightning 480mbps, USB C 10gbps.
Convenience: USBC-USBC connector can be plugged in on either end and charges and transfers on either end, lightning is a one way transmission connector so lightning-lightning could never be possible.
Cost: lightning cable $5.20+, USBC $2+ (cheapest of each on the market while being considered “non-semi-disposable”).

USBC is the best cable on the consumer market and because multiple companies worked to create the gold standard. Apple only made the 30-pin and the lightning so they could profit off the sale of any and all chargers and headphones to go with iPhones and iPads. This law would mean all companies would have to work together to create even better chargers in the future as has already happened with USBC.

&gt; Brå concludes that the initial spike in figures seen after 2005 ""is largely explained by the legal definition of rape expanding"" in that same year.  

There's also been a large effort to encourage Swedish women to report assaults, spurred in part by an Amnesty International report in 2009 that criticized the low conviction rate in Sweden. More reporting = higher rate of sexual assaults in the statistics. Most of the increase has come from women reporting on assaults from people known to them.

&gt;The report also found that the rise in reported rapes between 2011 and 2017 was linked to incidents that did not involve the use of violence, committed by perpetrators known to the victim – which also make up the majority of sexual crimes. There was no rise in outdoor attacks by strangers in the same time period.

Turkey benefits from Libya failing. The diplomacy that Turkey is using with Europe is back alley deals for naive Europeans. Turkey doesn't benefit from peace.

Of course not, because it sees the soft power and the strong worded letters of Europe as idiot moves.

I would really love to see someone say that to the tribal leaders of Libya and see how much time it would take until they got shot. This is not a negotiation between Belgium and Luxembourg.

Brazil has roughly 204M people and 720k inmates, around 350/100000, but the prison system has a capacity of ""only"" 450k. Prisons are severely overcrowded, leading to a bunch of other problems:

\- Minor offenders may be put directly on probation because there isn't available space in a nearby prison (it happens a lot).

\- Inmates get sick and die due to the poor conditions.

\- Rebellions in prisons due to the lack of infrastructure for the inmates, which ultimately lead to

\- ""Purges"" - inmates killing each other in order to reduce population.

Generally speaking, Brazilian police forces try their best even with the limited resources they are given.

The real problem is much deeper than ""just"" corruption. Education, employment, housing, infrastructure, basic care, and so on. Giving the people, especially the less fortunate, adequate conditions to turn them away from crime.

Prisoner dilemma is this:
- Prisoner A gets 5 years if he doesn't rat prisoner B
- Prisoner B gets 5 years if he doesn't rat prisoner A
- If they both don't rat each other out they are free to go.
- If they both rat each other out they get 50 years.
- If one rats out on other he gets off free while other one gets 50.
- They can't communicate with each other.

This situation means that the best case scenario is for everyone to not rat out but since they can't know what other will do it is only logical for them to rat each other out. Because they will be able to walk away free instead of getting 5 years.

In the end they rat each other out because individually they want to go into most logical way of their own self interest.

Look at Japan, it's densely populated and mountainous, and yet they are lightyears ahead in terms of high speed trains. Sure, it's easier and cheaper to build on uninhabited flatlands, but it's still feasible to do it in more dense areas. I already took the trains over the high speed lines Amsterdam-Antwerp and Luik-Brussel, both are well designed, and prove that it is possible to squeeze in a high speed line with proper planning. Even if it means building around. 

It's generally the actions of the governments that are dragging the entire idea down. The Dutch HSL is plagued by its ancient trains running on the HSL because of a high-speed train debacle that is dragging for almost a decade, as well as by a government decision not to build a HSL to Germany.

1184,"How so? We're in a different era of the economy. You're assuming that we have the same options that boomers had. They lived in the high tide of industrial capitalism; readily available new markets requiring massive amount of labour were still being discovered; television, cars, phones etc were still spreading. This vast requirement for labour meant that wages increased and jobs were readily available to even people with no education. Back then those people could still get a job in a shop and expect to be able to raise a family, buy a house etc. This was in a period where public housing was more prevalent than it is today by the way. 

Modern capitalism has different requirements. Most markets have been saturated and as a result Capital - to maintain compound growth - has instead spread into finance, investment, mortgages, stocks and so on. These new markets do not require massive amount of relatively low skill labour. Whatmore the systemic requirements of international competition within the market: profit maximization and cutting costs of labour + resource input to stay competitive means that wages *need* to fall if private enterprise is to remain profitable in the face of international competition that is also cutting costs to stay competitive. We get shrinking middle classes  and in turn the rise of what german sociologists calls a 'precariat' i.e people with precarious relations to the job market such as Amazon employees and Uber drivers. 

This assault of Capital upon the wellbeing of labour is not only a systemic neccesity born of the logic of capitalism itself (competition -&gt; cutting costs -&gt; profit maximization -&gt; maintaining or increasing market share) but also one that undermines its own health. 

why? Well, as the lower middle class is pushed into the precariat we'll see lower wages for larger amounts of the general population meaning that the main force of domestic spending within every single western economy, the middle class, will loose purchasing power which leads to falling demand, a lack of growth and eventually economic crisis. 

I'm not hating on boomers. They did what they could with the options that their era presented to them. I think we would all have done the same but nontheless these options are no longer there because they were never anything but a momentary part of capitalist development.",,/r/europe/comments/epvtc0/since_2007_rents_up_by_21_house_prices_by_19_in/femu0md/,hakel93,1579269565

He stands where power is but one thing was consistent, he never really was any of those. Orban stands with Orban, that's his only ideology. He had a propaganda campaign going on against Jean Claude Juncer what won him an election while they were on pretty good terms.

What he does is a show, to make him stay in power. And it works, many Hungarians (mostly old people) do belive that we are under attack and that we need to trust Orban since he is the only one who can defend us.

there is no difference between wish to unify all chargers and unify all cars. Why is that in one case you understand it is bad idea and why in other you think it is good idea.

If different charger exist then there is reason for it. Even simple greed is good enough reason. It means that someone makes money on it and you want to stop it.

If it was trully something not needed then companies themselves would be unifying standards. Like in case of USB. Why is that every motherboard company has usb rather than their own solutions ? Because there were 5 (or more) other companies who agreed to use that usb instead of their own solutions and people bought their products instead of competition.

This is how standardization works. By competition not by government mandate.

Even then there might be some Apple(or someone else) who will come up with new port that will be 10 times better than USB3 and will want to use it and some people might want to use that because they like what it provides despite negative of not being wide standard.

1286,"""selecting data to support a preformed conclusion"" sounds more like a conscious fraud than a subconscious bias.

I think wiki you cite actually gives a pretty good definition:

""Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or strengthens one's prior personal beliefs or hypotheses.""

Remember it's a subconscious bias. Two people can see the same data and interpret it differently. Two people can see the same data and remember different parts of it.

I think it's important to remember that the biases are subconscious if we are to overcome them. It's not enough to see something like ""selecting data to support your preformed conclusions"" and say, ""that sounds awful, I'm not like that, I'm a decent person!""

Please explain to me what about my posts makes you think I have a sense of ethnic superiority. Let me be quite clear: I do not think Scots are superior to English people. 

&gt;  you both are constantly saying that you don't hate the rest of the country but that they are too incompetent compared to you

I don't hate the rest of the UK. I don't think the rest of the UK is incompetent. Scotland and England are on different political paths, and Scotland consistently has a government it doesn't want imposed on it. I would rather Scotland go their own way and have the power to elect their own government. 

&gt; that they are just holding your incredible potential back

Well, we are being dragged out of the EU and that will diminish the entire UK's potential, not just Scotland's. So yes, I do believe that an independent Scotland will have better potential if it wants to rejoin the EU. 

&gt;You are in for a disappointment if you think that a party entirely dedicated towards independence will save you in any way.

They also found that the group of refugees as a whole were less likely than their German peers to commit crimes.

Now, how can both be true at the same time? The answer is sex and age.

Refugees are disproportionally adolescent males, the most ""criminal"" age group there is.

Sadly that aren't many good charts available about it, but from  [http://www.buergerimstaat.de/1\_03/liniquenz.htm](http://www.buergerimstaat.de/1_03/liniquenz.htm) you can see the first picture or the table with values. While this is from 2001, the curve of the age groups doesn't change much.

Now, there are subgroups of refugees (or say asylum seeker) that definitely commit more crimes than even their German adolescent male counterpart, that's most from North Africa.

And it makes sense, true refugees will do their damnest to not get in conflict with the law. One conviction may lead to deportation, even for small stuff like stealing.

For those from North Africa (i generalize of course) however, they have just about no chance to gain asylum status in the first place.

There is no moral high ground in realpolitik.  Moral high ground is a perception used to persuade people to support whatever action is taken. EU and European countries also have no moral high-ground. For Europe, it’s all about trade and money when it comes to Iran. The EU, especially Germany and France, could care less if Iran is killing its own people, or killing others in the region.

After an initial sharp decline following the financial crisis, house prices remained more or less stable between 2009 and 2014. Then there was a rapid rise in early 2015, since when house prices have increased at a much faster pace than rents.

Over the period 2007 until the third quarter of 2019 rents increased by 21.0% and house prices by 19.1%.

Between 2007 and the third quarter of 2019, there were increases in house prices in 22 EU Member States and decreases in 6, with the highest rises in Austria (+85.5%), Luxembourg (+80.6%) and Sweden (+80.3%). The largest decreases were observed in Greece (-40.0%), Romania (-27.2%) and Ireland (-16.7%).

For rents, the pattern was different with increases in all Member States, except Greece\* (-17.5%) and Cyprus (-0.3%). The largest increases were observed in Lithuania (+101.1%), Czechia (+78.6%) and Hungary (+67.8%).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/epvtc0/since_2007_rents_up_by_21_house_prices_by_19_in/fem2m3f/,filosoful,1579237707

1693,"&gt; An sich sind wir der gleichen Meinung, meine Erfahrung und Einschätzungen ist es jedoch mit höheren Löhnen nicht getan. Es gibt viele Faktoren die Land.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ich find das fasst es gut zusammen

Von höheren Löhnen sind wir auch weit entfernt. Es gilt ja den Abstieg von guten Löhnen auf Hartz zu vermeiden. Ein Arbeitsplatz in der Tourismusbranche kann freilich nicht mit Industrielöhnen mithalten, ist aber halt immer noch besser als gar keine Arbeit.

Was die Dame da schreibt - von wegen Akademikerinnen anlocken/zurückholen - trifft halt nur in sehr begrenztem Maß bis gar nicht auf diese Regionen zu. Wenn es für eine Friseuse zu trist ist, wird so eine Gegend auch mit Studium nicht attraktiver. 

Um zu vermeiden, dass die bereits fetten Ballungsräume noch fetter und die ärmeren Regionen noch mehr abgehängt werden, müsste man an ganz anderen Stellschrauben drehen. Weder Strukturfond konnte das stoppen, noch wird der neue Verteilungsmechanismus daran viel ändern können. Mit etwas Glück kann man halt einen Kollaps abmildern. Wunder brauchen wir nicht erwarten.

&gt;Da ist so, falls die Autoindustrie schwächelt investieren in München, Stuttgardt, Ingolstadt und Wolfsburg.(Nur als unkonkretes Beispiel) 

Das klingt zwar oberflächlich betrachtet pervers, macht aber auch Sinn. Auch dort gilt es den Abstieg zu vermeiden. Von diesen Zentren hängt dann z.B. High-Tech Gewerbe dran, Forschung, Universitäten etc. Wenn Audi wächst, kann man sich die THI vielleicht noch nen zusätzlichen Lehrstuhl gönnen. Wenn es dagegen nicht läuft für Audi, dann entsteht der Lehrstuhl deswegen nicht an einer anderen Hochschule, sondern fällt halt ganz weg. Zu diesen gewachsenen Zentren gibt es einfach keine Alternative, egal welche Mittel man da in andere Regionen pumpen würde.

&gt;Wenn diese 800 million, wenigsten an was gebunden wären. Nein unser Fahrplan steht. Ich finde die Fördermenge sollte an Ambitionen und deren Umsetzung geknüpft sein.

Naja, das Geld wird ja nicht mit der Gießkanne verteilt, da sind Bedingungen mit verknüpft. Ein Teil des Geldes wird ja auch nicht einfach transferiert sondern kommt in der Form eines Investitionskredits, muss also zurückbezahlt werden. Desweiteren muss das jeweilige Land afaik auch noch die selbe Summe selber aufbringen und hängt damit auch mit drin, was hoffentlich die Sinnhaftigkeit in der Verwendung größtenteils sicherstellt.

&gt;Ersten gibt es sowas wie europäische Solidarität, zweitens ist der normal Struktur-topf für alle Regionen da, drittens weil wir es nicht nötig haben, viertens beschleunigt das Geld nicht unseren Ausstieg. 

Schau dir mal die Verteilung der Mittel an. Sehe nicht, dass andere europäische Regionen darunter zu leiden hätten, und schon gar nicht, dass Deutschland im Vergleich besser wegkommt. Die Mittel, die z.B. Rumänien zugeordnet werden muss die Regierung dort dann auch erst mal sinnvoll auf die Straße bekommen. Im Ende werden dann wohl wie so oft sämtliche zur Verfügung stehenden Mittel gar nicht erst abgerufen weil es Umsetzungsmöglichkeiten fehlt.


&gt;Stimme ich dir zu, aber auch die Landesregierung, besonder NRW und Sachsen sind Fein raus. Zwei schon immer(geschichtlich gesehen) starke Industrie Regionen Deutschland und Europa's halten an der Kohle fest und bauen kein Stück erneuerbare Energien.

Im Vergleich zu früher ist da nicht mehr viel mit Kohle. Der Strukturwandel im Ruhrgebiet musste auch mit Fördermaßnahmen begleitet werden, sonst sähe es da um einiges übler aus.

&gt;Ich bin für die ländliche Entwicklung, besonder im Osten/Nordosten Deutschland, aber die Förderung einer der reichsten Gebiete Mittel- Deutschlands, als Almosen für die armen auszugeben ist Augenwischerei.

1700,"So first you call me ignorant and uniformed for calling socialism a dictatorship of the people and then when I present you with the words of your intellectual leaders so say yes but capitalism is also a dictatorship.

First of all not acknowledging your mistake was dishonest.
Second, the only thing you have been doing from the beginning is use whataboutism. A formal fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument. Which, funny enough, has been widely used by the Soviet propaganda machine. It could be a coincidence but when you defend socialism by pointing out bad things the US and other western countries have done the only thing you accomplish is sound like a Soviet mouthpiece. You seem to be obsessed with the US as if the cold war hasn't ended, but just ignore my comment about the USSR invading Afghanistan.

More importantly you cannot justify the suffering socialism has caused by saying capitalism has done worse. You cannot justify anything bad by claiming something is also bad.  You cannot morally justify commiting a murder by pointing out that there are murderers in the world.

Also capitalism is not a complete socioeconomic system. Capitalism is only an economic system. It can be combined with a government style that ranges from fully democratic (e.g Norway) to authoritarian (e.g. China and Russia). Also the extend of how free and unregulated a capitalistic market also varies. Both of these countries are able to trade in a capitalistic way with each other but operate and treat their citizens very differently. The degree of having a social safety net also varies.

Socialism, however, is a complete socioeconomic system because as you yourself said, it cannot function unless everyone is on board. I am not talking here about social policies like wellfare and unemployment benefits. I am talking about socialism as the intermediate step to communism that aims in making all means of production communal. Since it is practically impossible to have everyone agree on something, especially involving some of them losing a quite a lot, it has to manufacture this agreement. Again as you said, by exiling dissidents and I will add to that imprisoning, exterminating and oppressing them. This is the reason that every practical implementation of socialism we have seen always resulted in these measures in order to function. The requirement of socialism for practically 100% approval and participation in the system naturally leads to opression of those who disagree. Of course in a socialistic system you have 100% agreement because that's the only choice and you dare to call this the most democratic system? By that measure North Korea is the most democratic state on the planet right now. They have ""elections"" and Kim Jong-un always gets close to 100% of the votes. A democratic society on the other hand tolerates dissidents (within limits of course and terrorists fall outside these limits) even if they are minorities. If it was up to you, from what you have been saying, you would kick anyone who votes for AFD outside of Germany and then proudly claim Germany is 100% racist free. A democracy does not work like this, an authoritarian regime does. This is why China is doing exactly this with their Uyghur minortiy, continuing their undemocratic oppressive procedures left over from Mao Che Tung's time.

If you are not convinced the west has more freedom than anywhere else ask yourself where would you prefer to be a minortiy in? Try being a Christian in Saudi Arabia or a Muslim in China.

This is was my point. Socialism is an intrisrically inhumane and doomed to fail system that has been proven to be brutally inhumane and has been proven to collapse every time it was attempted. It fails in theory and in practice. You say it has never been properly implemented. You say wait and see, we will reach the point that all the citizens in a state will agree and spontaneously start sharing everying. I am saying this hasn't happened because it cannot happen.

The West/East Germany divide, as tragic as it was, was probably the largest social experiment the world has ever witnessed. It was carried out in almost perfect conditons. The same nation starting off from the same point of utter devastation after ww2 applying two different socioeconomic systems. After 40 years, this experiment was cut short and the winner was clear. One side was one of the most prosperous states on the planet and the other had resulted in imprisoning its whole population and spying on its own citizens to maintain its meagre existence. 

You can say that it was better for people back then and I believe you when you say this was your personal experience. However, if we go by the election results in the former East German states the socialist parties like PDS and Die Linke have gained at best around 30% of the votes since the reunification. Ironically even AFD has managed to get higher percentage than die Linke in recent elections. So at the very best only 30% feel nostalgic about the socialist past and this after the left wing parties have denounced a lot of their hardcore socialist retoric.

I don't want to even touch the refugees topic that got you so riled up. Your statistic proves my point. Migrants and refugees, who can afford smugglers, choose to go to democratic free market economies as their destinations. The US that you love to hate on has around 10 million illegal immigrants that have risked their lives to get there. How many does Venezuela have?

This is my last message to you. It really is a waste of my time to put the effort and debate you, when you are clearly not discussing honestly. You ignore the points I make and continuously move the goal post. You use typical soviet style propaganda talking points and logical fallacies instead of analyzing ideas. You have also resulted in name calling several times whereas I have refrained from any derogatory characterisations and have kept my side of the discussion civil. A simple example of a successful implementation of socialism would have sufficed, but since this is impossible you result in name calling.

Yes, turkey is a transit country and by stealing their eez greece decreases that element of turkey

unclos demands bilateral agreements when there are frictions and there are MANY instances where a tiny island/patch of land away from mainland, within the influence of another country to have eez limited to their territorial waters such as Colombia/Nicaragua, Canada/France, Spain/Morocco. Greece is extremely dishonest and relies on international pressure to justify their own claims and western world is always ready to support greece instead of turkey anyway. They refuse to sit down and make concessions, they are extremely conceited. You cannot justify a 12kmsquare island with a population less than 500 to steal enormous area of eez from mainland which is much larger and has much bigger population.

I agree there too, they don't want full scale war. Georgia and Ukraine prove that they grab as much as possible and wait until opposite side agrees to ceasefire.

2106,"That article is basically indistinguishable from a random angry reddit comment.

Where to start, how about from the end; we are supposed to believe that the concept of microaggression is bad because of guilt by association, for some reason chosing to misattribute the creation the term to someone who is presumably more satisfying to insult than it's actual [originator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Middlebrook_Pierce), someone who analysed the effects of persistent racism on health markers.

I mean, that is  medicalisation, just as telling people that passive smoking has health effects is medicalisation of what was previously a social nuissance. But we can't just pretend passive smoking doesn't have an affect because we don't want it to, sometimes what we do affects other people, and we should be able to take responsibility for our actions.

Then the author talks about how people seeking structural changes have no inclination towards nuance, and cannot accept that there might be social problems in black communities, how about David Lammy MP, who started off with this exact perspective, and by [investigation of the criminal justice system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Oq8NSLoDEU&amp;t=7m32s), discovered racial discrimination he was not expecting. The linked video discusses that in some detail, at a leisurely pace. Precisely those things the article says cannot yet be discussed are being discussed without issue.

The article's writer says that they are part of a brain tranquillising loop, and they can't actually talk about the things that matter, because the evil left wing are forcing them to talk about them instead. They simply cannot have a conversation about race without someone left wing in the room to help them do it, and talk about it on their terms.

2218,"I will try to explain to foreigners what is happening.

Putinism is expensive oil, as soon as the price of oil falls, Putinism suddenly disappears. Its real support is 30-40%. His electorate is mostly old people and completely frostbitten vegetables, like those who vote for Trump. While the oil price was high, everything suited the Russians, the economy was growing, the euro and the dollar were worth less. It was like a deal with a shuller, you give me power and as much authority as possible, in return I give you money, and many were happy with it while the price of oil was high.

But now the price of oil has fallen, and Russia will be forced to develop the processing industry and services for economic growth, this requires investments.

The current government, by definition, is not capable of such steps, they simply do not understand how to make such an economy. They know how to build oil and gas pipelines, and that’s all.

Putin is well aware of the consequences of further stagnation of the economy.

In this regard, there are several options: He is really trying to create a cabinet that will be free in his actions, and give them the opportunity to engage in real reforms. Plus, it paves the way for further transit of power, it is important for him that even after his resignation, he could influence through  minions the foreign policy of Russia. But give freedom to domestic politics.

The second important step, if implemented, is to limit the presidential powers to two terms. People who say that it doesn’t matter, Putin can simply put his minion as president. People who think in this way have little understanding of what the legacy of the autocracy of the Russian empire is.

Who is in the Kremlin, that is the boss. This is a simple axiom. Putin is not getting younger, and there is no guarantee that his ""minion"" will suddenly not begin to operate fully independently, and then there will be no way for Putin to influence this person. By the fact that who is in the Kremlin, he is the boss. Putin had the opportunity to change this state of things when he came to power, he deliberately did not. With new reforms, Russia is turning from a super-presidential republic, just to a presidential republic.

It is too early to draw any conclusions, but we hope for the best. Perhaps his thoughts are as follows: do you want democracy? Please, but only after 2024.",,/r/europe/comments/ep2hud/russian_government_resigns/fek0a7r/,Chikimona,1579189848

They can get low end jobs easily, but once again, going up kinda requires them to be so integrated in society that it becomes hard to tell that they are Arabs (specially since in Portugal we have a lot of Indian offspring from colonization, and we have nothing against those).

Cisco and Qualcomm sell 5G tech. Pretending that they don't doesn't help your credibility. Yes, they lag behind the top players and that's exactly why the US is using ""trade wars"" to stall Huawei tech adoption.

&gt; You offer no real rebuttal to the fact that China's protectionism, IP theft and forced technology transfers have long been an issue

I never said otherwise. My only point here is that the US is using false pretenses to boost its own companies. And they do it because, otherwise, we'd have to call them out for the same protectionist tactics they're accusing China of using.

2370,"&gt;You are correct that most of the media outlets are pro Fidesz, but there  are plenty of pro opposition channels and newspapers too. The most  watched news channel, RTL klub leans in favor of the opposition while  the most popular news website ([index.hu](https://index.hu/)) is also pro opposition. 

This is simply not true. The public media, by far the most consumed source for news in Hunagry, became under Fidesz' rule the megaphone of the government (no, this is not the purpose of public media). Private media, if not reporting positively about the government, simply doesn't get attention from the government and state (as government and state, as in every good autocracy melted together).

&gt;However, even if they were not as popular, I'd argue that inequality in  the political affiliation of media outlets isn't an indication that  there is no media freedom in the country. For example, in the United  States, the overwhelming majority of news outlets and channels are pro  Democrat. Does that mean there is no media freedom in the US? Of course  not but for some reason when it comes to Hungary, it's a crucial  problem.

Where do you take this? This is bullshit. What all media shares in the US: It's pro corporations. The single biggest medium is btw Fox News. Hardly pro Democrats.

&gt;The opposition just won in Budapest and in a lot of other major cities a  few months ago. You either don't know what you're talking about or  you're lying. 

Gerrymandering is a thing in Hungary, yes. Especially outside of Budapest.

&gt; The EU cannot threaten to kick them out because there is no law or any  sort of legal mechanism that can kick out a member state. But sure, if  you think there is some sort of grand pact between the evil dictators of  Poland and Hungary to stay in and secretly subvert the EU from within,  keep believing that. Whatever floats your boat I guess... 

It's not a conspirancy when it's public. The Visegrád states actively undermining European democracy and the power of the institutions is no secret.

""600 bucks for a shot of insulin"" Well, no. That is what the insurance says it costs, but no one actuallys pays this. 
But overall, yes, costs are very high. They used to be very affordable, until, who could have guesed, the government took over in the 60s and 70s. The same applies to higher education.

The funny thing is that the government takes over a sector, fucks it up, but one generation later no one can imagine how  it could be done without the government so the only solution is even more of the same.
Healthcare is a market like any other.
People don't choose that they houses burn down, that their car stops working, that their cat gets sick, that a million things happen, and yet we let the market work in all these areas (more or less).

&gt; There's NO ""if"". There was a bunch of deserters who betrayed Nazi and sought ""asylum"" on either western or eastern fronts. 

That's a figure of style, that's why the sentence continues. I agree that not every German soldier was a Nazi supporter 

&gt;Except conscription was reintroduced way before the war in 1935.

Military service, yes. Mobilization orders started in 1939, after Czechoslovakia and just before Poland. The Wehrmacht will be a big conscript army only after the start of the war, and it's only by 43/44 that they had to increase the range of conscription because that's the only they could find new men. 

&gt;P.S. The so very evil demon [Oskar Schindler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler) was a Nazi.

Because AFAIK every country has a thing where the party which has representation gets a percentage of funds from the country's budget according to their votes.

2571,"You're conflating ""doesn't win"" and ""can't win"". 

There are no guarantees or need that any specific party would win or that it would move to an equilibrium of a few parties or such. It would be absolutely acceptable if one party would permanently get elected - as long as it were fair elections. The opposition doesn't win - though they could, given sufficient popularity.

So I'm right with you on that one and I also don't think that Secuter meant this wouldn't be democratic, but rather if the opposition can't win. Meaning that even if the opposition was gaining popularity, the government would keep changing the system in order to stay in power, resulting in the opposition being unable to be elected, even with public support. The only way the opposition could get in power would be outside of the system; reform / revolution (including peaceful changes in the system as happened after the end of the cold-war in quite some places) or such.

Emissions are only part of the story. Particulate pollution is a bigger problem.


“Short answer: no. And here's why. Back in 1998 the EU promoted diesel as a more environmentally friendly fuel. Diesel contains more carbon than petrol but carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of diesels tend to be lower.”

The actual Albanian identity wasn't properly developed until the early 1900's, though. Before that, most Albanians identified by their religion. Muslim Albanians identified as a Muslim, whereas Orthodox Albanians identified as Orthodox. Likewise for Catholic Albanians.

 The Muslim Albanians were traditionally allied with the Ottoman government and helped suppress and harass the local Christian populations many times.  You can especially see that in the Greek War of Independence. The vast majority of atrocities committed against the Greeks by the Ottomans were primarily committed by local Muslim Albanians the Sultan recruited.  The vast majority of Arvanites in Greece chose to side against their Muslim counterparts and instead chose to identify as Arvanite-speaking Greeks.",,/r/europe/comments/ep8ww1/map_showing_the_distribution_of_the_albanian/fej8vzd/,Child_of_Peace,1579161958
2642,"Why would you assume that I don't do both of those things? I spend a reasonable amount of money on abolition of animal agriculture (both in research and on political level). However, we live in a capitalistic system and production will follow demand, so instead of buying animal products (all animal products come with certain types of harm towards animals) I spend money on alternatives. In such way the market for products that inflict less harm on animals grows, while the market for animal products shrinks. Besides politicians will also always use clear signs of demand of the population to justify their decisions (e.g. we do not have highways just for the fun of it or because neighborhoods like the sound of it; we have highways because their is a demand for quick transportation of people and goods).If there wouldn't be a high demand for those products there politicians will not promote it (e.g. when there was a cheaper alternative for whale blubber, most politicians no longer saw the necessity to legalize whaling).

It's not yet a ""perfect"" solution yet, as asphyxiation is still legal - but it is a step into the right direction in my opinion. Hopefully, methods that allow determination of sex at an early stage will be commercialized soon (if they have not been already).

&gt;The Federal Council prohibits the shredding of live chicks  
&gt;  
&gt;Bern, 23.10.2019 - The shredding of live chicks (""homogenisation"") will be prohibited in Switzerland. This was decided by the Federal Council in its meeting on 23 October 2019. The ban will come into force on 1 January 2020. The Animal Welfare Ordinance will be amended accordingly.  
&gt;  
&gt;Up to now, the homogenisation or shredding of live chicks has been permitted in Switzerland. With this killing method, the male animals were killed by a mechanical process. In recent years, however, this method has only been used in a few hatcheries and in exceptional cases.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the beginning of 2019, the Federal Council was requested by means of a motion to ban this method of killing. The Animal Welfare Ordinance will be amended accordingly and will come into force on 1 January 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Switzerland, the cantonal veterinary services are responsible for the enforcement of the Ordinance on Animal Welfare. As part of their inspection activities, they will ensure that the ban is complied with on the farms concerned. Killing with CO2 remains permitted.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sex determination method on the verge of a breakthrough  
&gt;  
&gt;An alternative to the existing killing methods is the so-called method of sex determination in the hatching egg. With this method it is possible to determine the sex of the chicks very early after fertilization. In this way the hatching eggs of male laying chicks can be eliminated early and male laying chicks would not hatch at all. At present, these new methods are not yet widely used. However, several international companies and universities are researching and developing a commercial method in this area under high pressure, which is also in Switzerland's interest.",,/r/europe/comments/eojg5y/germany_and_france_to_push_eu_to_end_shredding_of/feiidja/,curiossceptic,1579139228

""The situation is serious when the judges take to the streets in protest. The government in one of the largest EU countries is campaigning to intimidate judges who defend independence and independence from political control.

Some were affected by disciplinary procedures. Such repression is unprecedented in the history of the EU, if new legislation is adopted, it may turn out that judges will be released for complying with CJEU judgments. This is a challenge for the EU as a rule of law community. (...)

&gt;**The situation in Poland is a European problem, without the independence of the courts there will be no EU ""**

\- said Michal Šimečka, European parliamentarian from Slovakia.

""It strikes me that you act against the interests of Poles. Poles are pro-European, but if you do not recognize the European Commission or the CJEU judgments, then it really will be Polexit. Did you lie to the electorate before the election? ""- asked Polish MEPs Sophie in't Veld from Denmark.

On January 15, 2020, after 17:30, a stormy debate on the rule of law in Poland began in the European Parliament, and its main topic was the repression of judges.

At first, Vice President of the European Commission Věra Jourová recalled the recent events:

* two CJEU provisions unfavorable for Poland: a judgment regarding retirement age for judges and answers to preliminary questions regarding the status of the Disciplinary Chamber;
* Supreme Court ruling of November, which stated that the Disciplinary Chamber is not a court within the meaning of European and national law;
* EC decision to apply to the CJEU to apply a temporary measure to the Disciplinary Board;
* and finally - a law disciplining judges and the repression that they face.

Judges from Poland were also present. Before the debate, they met with MEPs to explain the sense of the latest PiS legislative offensive. Foreign MEPs addressed their support to them.

""One scene from today's meeting particularly impressed me. One judge talked about how much the Polish Constitution meant to him when he started working. He spoke about the vow to the Constitution. It shows who the people we want to protect are.

&gt;**They defend our rule of law, our democracy, they are the backbone of our system.**

Judges, lawyers and prosecutors deserve protection, because it protects the separation of powers in democracy, ""said Terry Reintke of the Greens, a German MEP.

""We will not leave you alone, we will not forget about you"" - added Robert Metsola from Malta.

### Gowns in the streets? Propaganda and sense of protest of judges

January 15, 2020

European MPs have repeatedly emphasized that what is happening in Poland is an attack not only on the foundations of the EU, which embodies the EU treaty, but also on its future.

Bartosz Arłukowicz, a member of the European Coalition, was applauded for his position.

""This debate is not about Poland, but about the future of Europe and the security and freedom of our children. If we allow lawlessness to spread anywhere, it will be our fault. If we let the rebel judges break their backs anywhere, it will be our fault. If we let the guilty ones be sued and acquitted, it will be our fault. If we let dull propaganda flood us every day, we will lose Europe, ""said Arłukowicz.

PiS had to defend itself against strong accusations by telling the ""message of the day"" many times. Poland is a sovereign country and no one will tell us how to reform the post-communist justice system. And the mandate for this has already been given to us six times by voters (MP Ryszard Czarnecki).

&gt;**""Poland bothers you because it doesn't stick to the German leg.** **Poland gets up from her knees.** **He refuses to accept migrants, technologies, wants to be a sovereign, subjective state. ""**

## What: ""It bothers you that Poland gets up from your knees""

**Beata Szydło, PiS MEP** : ""Courts in Poland are independent and free. Poland is a law-abiding country. In Poland, judges can protest and no one is putting order forces against them.

&gt;**Anyone who says otherwise - is lying.** **All Poles sitting in this room know about it.**

Four years ago, exactly in a few days, the infamous anniversary of the Polish opposition that organized the debate against Poland will pass. As the prime minister of the Polish government, I represented Poland at the time. The court reform mission was undertaken by the PiS government, which was democratically mandated. During these four years we have carried out a number of reforms. Poles have trusted us again. ""

**Sylwia Spurek, independent MEP** : ""We are dealing with a monopoly. There is an attempt to suppress the law and limit the independence of judges. I am sorry to say that, but the actions of civil society and the launch of Art. 7 proved to be insufficient. Time for further steps. The activities of the Disciplinary Board must be suspended. ""

**Andrzej Halicki, MEP KO** : ""No one gives the ruling party a mandate to break the constitution. Polish judges just because they want to comply with the law cannot be disciplined. We are in favor of a resolution that protects and strengthens the Union. There is no freedom without the rule of law. ""

**Joachim Brudzinski, PiS MEP** : ""Where were you, how were those in government (...) how did the services enter the weekly"" WPROST "", how was the spirit of guilty fans stopped when they unlawfully dissolved Independence March?""

**Anna Zalewska, PiS MEP** : You use formulations that they have no idea about. Please provide any example of a purge in Poland, in a free sovereign country. (...) Poles love the Union and they want changes in the justice system anyway. Please, do not speak newspaper titles, but give examples, and there are none. ""

**Sira Rego, European MEP from Spain** : ""Repression of judges, **LGBT-free zones**, criminalization of sex education (...) persecution of human rights. It is dramatic that something like this is happening in an EU country. It cannot be that the Polish government does not comply with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. (...)

&gt;We cannot make concessions to the far right. We cannot be partners of those who want to go back to the darkest period in history. ""

**Jadwiga Wiśniewska, PiS MEP** : ""Commissioner Jourová encourages the Polish government to consult on the judicial system, I would like to say that the European Union is not an association of the republics of member states, but an association of states that want to carry out a joint mission. Each country is sovereign and maintains its powers when it comes to justice. Poles are a proud, law-abiding, democratic country. We do not deserve that the good name of Poland would be shabby. Why is this happening? Because we have an opposition that has set itself the goal of reporting to Poland. (...)

&gt;No opposition behaves in such a shameful manner towards the homeland as the so-called European Coalition.

If we don't know what else is going on, (...) you want to check how far you can go in the appropriation of national competence. You want to go federation. ""

**Esteban Gonzáles Pons, MEP from Spain:** ""I am moved by the march of Polish judges. We urge the Polish government to respect the Constitution, which is the European Constitution; to respect Polish judges who are European judges; to respect the justice system that belongs to European. We demand the same from all countries, whether east, west, north or south. We defend the right of Poles to have a system that can be trusted. We do not attack the government, but we defend citizens.

&gt;And if we have to choose between this government and the citizens, then we know which side to take. ""

**Patryk Jaki, PiS MEP: ""** Characteristically you say that the law is broken, but no one has said what the politicized choice of judges is. If you did that, you would know what a lie is. Do you know that in Poland judges elect judges and in Germany a Bundestag MP became a judge quite recently? Are you telling us that the choice is politicized? This is the peak of cynicism. (...) Do you know that the judges have recently had the protection of the Polish police? Let the French judges who were led out by the police speak out. (...)

2895,"I visited this July for the first time ever with my wife and three kids.

After six days in Munich we traveled by train on the VERY AFFORDABLE Bayern pass and we stopped in Salzburg. For about half of the train ride it was standing room only.  It was the only long train ride of the summer that we had to stand on and it was brutal.  Once at the station we put our bags in a locker and we took a short walk from the station for a wonderful garden lunch of goulash and schnitzel along with some beer for the adults and ""Austrian lemonade"" for the kids.

With full bellies we boarded a bus that was supposed to take us to the funicular to the fortress, but we got off on the wrong stop and walked about a mile through a complex of beautiful cathedrals, and medieval buildings and a gorgeous cemetery (Petersfriedhof).

Eventually with the help of google maps we found our way and up to the Hohensalzburg Fortress.  It was an amazing view and quite fun looking around the ancient structure but we had a train to catch to Vienna so after all the effort of getting up there we only looked around for &lt;1hr.  We took the walk down which was MUCH more difficult and MUCH longer than we anticipated.  We made it back to the station in time and were off to Vienna.

We booked a fantastic 4 bedroom AB&amp;B (a real lived in family home) with a rooftop terrace in Vienna (amazing views of the city at night and the air was always full of amazing classical music from the neighborhood). We visited Schonbrunn Zoo and ate some delicious garlic fried bread (langos? so yummy), we walked through the Hofburg Palace, took a carriage ride around town, visited St. Stephens and St. Peter, road the ferris wheel at Prater Amuzement, saw Spiderman Homecoming at a theater, and had some fantastic food, including more goulash!, cordon-bleu schnitzel, and TEX-MEX of all things!

""Mrs. prof. Today, Małgorzata Gersdorf, 1st President of the Supreme Court, decided to submit to the composition of three chambers of the Supreme Court - the Civil Chamber, the Criminal Chamber and the Chamber of Labor and Social Security - questions related to discrepancies in the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court, ”spokesman SN the judge Michał told a press conference Laskowski.

&amp;#x200B;

Three chambers of the Supreme Court, in which the majority of the councils sit before the ""good change"", at the request of President Gersdorf, are to finally decide what judges whom the new National Council of the Judiciary recommended.

&amp;#x200B;

The question concerns judges appointed to common courts, military courts and the Supreme Court.

&amp;#x200B;

The composition of the three Chambers is to answer whether their participation in the trial leads to a violation of the provisions of the Polish Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights, as well as the EU Treaty and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.

&amp;#x200B;

In accordance with art. 87 of the Act on the Supreme Court, resolutions of the composition of the combined chambers automatically gain the force of a legal principle and become binding on all adjudicating panels of the Supreme Court.

&amp;#x200B;

See what legal issue will be considered by SN

The meeting is scheduled to take place on Thursday, January 23, 2020 at 11.00. This is a very quick response from the Supreme Court.

&amp;#x200B;

""Given the current situation, ongoing legislative work and the pace of action of other Houses, it is difficult to talk about excessive haste. This is an extraordinary matter. In view of the repeated questions of common courts, discrepancies in jurisprudence and the social importance of the issue, one should strive to solve it quickly, obviously with the awareness of the importance of this decision, ""explained Judge Laskowski.

Divergences in the judgments of ""old"" chambers and ""new""

In the justification of the application, President Gersdorf reminds that in accordance with the provisions of the Act on the Supreme Court, he may ask any composition of the Supreme Court to resolve a legal issue to ensure ""uniformity of case law"".

&amp;#x200B;

Such unity has been lacking in recent judgments and resolutions of individual SN Chambers after the judgment of the EU Court of Justice of November 19. In answering the questions referred for a preliminary ruling, the CJEU instructed the Supreme Court to assess independently whether the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court and the new National Court Register are independent bodies.

&amp;#x200B;

On December 5, the Chamber of Labor, which asked questions, based on Luxembourg criteria , did not . In the ruling, she emphasized that

&amp;#x200B;

the guidelines for checking independence from the CJEU judgment are binding on all countries, all courts, all law-enforcement bodies. Not only questioning courts.

&amp;#x200B;

But on January 8, 2020, a resolution of the opposite content was issued by a seven-member composition of the Chamber of Extraordinary Control and Public Affairs. Only judges appointed by the new National Court Register sit in this chamber.

&amp;#x200B;

The Chamber stated that the independence of the National Court Register may be examined only when considering individual appeals against its resolutions. But only until the president is appointed judge.

&amp;#x200B;

President Gersdorf also recalled the famous resolution of the full composition of the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court, also composed of only ""new judges. On April 10, 2019, as part of the pre-emptive movement before the CJEU judgment, the Chamber ""legalized"" itself .

&amp;#x200B;

Only old SN cadres are to meet in the meeting on January 23, 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

""New judges from the Disciplinary Chambers and Extraordinary Control will not attend the meeting for a simple reason. This issue directly concerns their status. The President refers to the old maxim that judges cannot rule on their own case. ""

&amp;#x200B;

\- explained judge Michał Laskowski.

&amp;#x200B;

""The issue to be resolved is the participation in the meeting and voting in it of the seven new judges who adjudicate in the Civil Chamber,"" he added.

&amp;#x200B;

Cut the doubts

President Gersdorf's decision is good news for the rule of law defenders who have appealed to cut the doubts that arose after the November judgment of the CJEU.

&amp;#x200B;

At [OKO.press](https://OKO.press), legal experts dr Michał Ziółkowski and Michał Krajewski wrote about the risk of divergence in the decisions of individual Chambers of the Supreme Court.

&amp;#x200B;

""In our opinion, the Supreme Court showed the strength of Hercules in its judgment of December 5, 2019. But to ensure the legal security of citizens, the Supreme Court should use its competence to issue an exponential resolution. Such a resolution would settle the remaining doubts and show the way to the judges of lower courts, ""wrote lawyers.

&amp;#x200B;

""It could be taken at the request of the First President of the Supreme Court (e.g. in the composition of the combined chambers that have never been doubted before: Civil, Criminal, Labor and Social Security Chambers)"" - they proposed.

&amp;#x200B;

This is exactly what President Gersdorf made to the Supreme Court today.",,/r/europe/comments/epcjh0/president_gersdorf_checks_the_three_chambers_of/feikj32/,bm52oc,1579140665
2907,"Biggest increase lately was in Greater Manchester, innit?

I always try to look around problems instead of going through them.  This business of banning knives seems bonkers to me; the real achievement for a society is convincing people they don't even *want* to knife their neighbors.  So for instance when I tried thinking about this I immediately dived off to see if I could dig up information on paracetamol usage patterns.  Why?  It temporarily suppresses empathy.  It dampens shared bad feelings and shared good feelings.  There's a lot of people who take it in an ongoing way.  There are even some people who have started taking it for emotional pain - it reduces pain from being rejected.  The problem is that reduced rejection pain operates on the same neural pathways as the empathy-dampening.  Now, paracetamol doesn't make people into sociopaths, but the usage *has* been going up in recent years.  A society where everyone is a little less empathetic sounds a little less comfortable to me, in a lot of ways.  It's the kind of thing with knock-on effects.

I mean, it would take people away from getting the warm fuzzies on human interest stories, at the very least.  What do news organs do when the whole populous is a little less warm-fuzzy on human interest stories?  They have to keep their circulation up.  What's a society's entertainment start shifting towards when everyone gets dulled on sharing each others' pleasures and pain?

Nah, though.  Nobody like me gets listened to in power.  I'm not even proposing real policy here.  I'm just talking about...  oh, well, something nobody can do *anything* about.

2910,"## The Labor Chamber repeats its arguments

On the same day, January 15, 2020, the Chamber of Labor and Social Security issued two further judgments in cases in which in 2018 it asked questions for a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice of the EU.

&gt;**""Specific procedural decisions related to the parties to the proceedings were made.** **But, importantly, the Supreme Court fully shared the Supreme Court's arguments presented in the justification of the judgment of December 5, 2019, ""spokesman Laskowski said at the conference.**

The Supreme Court then considered the complaint of judge Andrzej Kuba.

### The Supreme Court strongly: ""The National Court Register is not independent, and the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court is not a court""

December 5, 2019

The judge was retired in 2018 under the new retirement age regulations. Andrzej Duda did not let him rule anymore. The president's decision was preceded by a resolution of the National Court Register, in which the Council negatively expressed further opinion of the judge. The judge appealed to the Supreme Court against this resolution.

Based on the answers of the EU Court, the Chamber of Labor decided not to refer the case of a judge of Cuba to the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court. On the basis of the criteria of the CJEU, it also ruled that the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court is not a court within the meaning of EU law, and the neo-KRS is not an independent body.

In its ruling on December 5, 2019, the Chamber of Labor stressed that

&gt;**the judgment of the CJEU is relevant for every common and administrative court in Poland.**

On January 15, 2020, she considered the cases of judges Krzysztof Emperor and Andrzej Siuchniński. These were slightly different from the case of Judge Cuba. Siuchniński and the Emperor did not appeal against the resolution of the National Court Register, but merely asked the Labor Chamber to determine whether they were actually retired after July 4, 2018, or whether they were active judges at all times.

""Archbishop Jędraszewski proved himself as an unwavering defender of faith and preacher of the truth""

Marek Jędraszewski the man of the year 2019? At least according to ""Gazeta Polska"". The weekly announced the award of a clergy. The statement of reasons stated that Jędraszewski proved himself to be ""a defender of faith and a proclaimer of the truth"", and as an example his words about the ""rainbow plague"" uttered at the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising.

&amp;#x200B;

The weekly Gazeta Polska, which became famous a few months ago for distributing ""Free Zone from LGBT"" stickers, awarded the ""Man of the Year to Gazeta Polska clubs"" award to Archbishop Marek Jędraszewski.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""We are very pleased to inform you that the award of the Gazeta Polska Clubs for 2019 was received by Archbishop Marek Jędraszewski. This is the verdict of the vast majority of our club members. Archbishop Jędraszewski has proved himself as a steadfast defender of faith and preacher of the truth. He has not been intimidated and repressed"" - we read .

Also some countries that import manufactured goods more so than produce them (US &amp; UK, for example) kind of outsource CO2 emissions for those products to the manufacturing countries (e.g. China and Germany), which can distort such statistics somewhat. (So some of China's and Germany's CO2 emmissions maybe should be counted there instead.... but the same argument goes for oil extracting countries, which are attributed some CO2 emmissions from extraction that more fairly would be counted for the countries that actually demand and import said oil, so mostly western nations.

Negotiating a port to a higher voltage (&gt; 5V) requires PD communication, which consists of sending messages back and forth over an extra (non-USB) wire between charger and device.  There is no way to mistakenly negotiate without this communication.  The HowToGeek writeup involves A-to-C connections and may damage the Type-A *charging port* if the sink device thinks it can draw more current than the port can actually supply (and a compliant Type-A  port has protections for that also).  There's absolutely no way to get more than 5V from an A port.

I guess all bets are off if everything is non-compliant (i.e., doesn't have an official USB logo on it), but that can't be handled by a spec.  If a crappy charger/cable shorts everything to 30V all the time, then there's nothing to do.

**- If we want to have Hungarian children instead of immigrants, the only way out is to allocate as much funds as possible to support families - said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban explaining the project of introducing free in vitro fertilization in state-managed clinics.** **Earlier, the government bought six such facilities from private owners.**📷

Zsolt Szigetvary / AP

Orban emphasizes that fertility is of ""strategic importance"" for Hungary and has long argued that the answer to the demographic crisis is not emigration, but procreation.

## Hungary is fighting a demographic crisis

Free in vitro will be available in Hungary from February 1. It is not yet clear who and on what terms will have the right to surgery. The Prime Minister ensures that over time it will be easily accessible and there will be no queues.

In December 2019, the Hungarian government bought six private infertility clinics: four in Budapest, one in Szeged and one in Tapolka. Thanks to this, he will have control over what happens with unused embryos. In addition, in vitro surgery will not be based on free market principles: the government will not grant permission to establish new clinics and will be free in existing ones.

The population of Hungary has been decreasing for four decades. This is due to both the low fertility rate (at 1.48) and economic emigration to European Union countries.",,/r/europe/comments/epaozz/hungary_viktor_orban_announces_free_in_vitro/fei7gbi/,bm52oc,1579131976

More and more I get the idea that they're intentionally crippling the non-service economy.

Rural people are more conservative than city dwellers, and they also have more children. At least in Western Europe this is the case. They're the progressive globalist's natural enemy, and thus they want to destroy the rural economy. It's been going on for a while now. That's why everyone is moving to cities, if they can, all the jobs and money are being concentrated there. And once you're there, you have to play along, or you lose your job and you're screwed.

Much different from some chicken farmer who owns his land and his business. You can't threaten to fire him or ruin his life with tweets or otherwise nudge and cajole him into being the kind of person you want him to be. He's his own man, and he'll sell his chickens anyway, as long as there are mouths to feed. So he can be moved only by brute force.

3084,"Unpopular opinion time.

USBC is TRASH for daily plug in items. The USBC design is CLEARLY inferior to Lightning.

USBC is different from the Lightning cable due to the fact that the Lightning Cable is a male connector, and USB-C is a female connector. This is important, because that means that there is something inside of the the USB-C phone that needs to slot into the USB-C charger.

This exposed chip/pin/whatever is a clear disadvantage to daily use, high environmental stress, mobile devices. The chip will collect lint, dust, and other debris and is far more difficult to clean properly. This chip also has a physical weakness, where you may directly damage the exposed chip. There is also the case of

Lightning on the other hand has pad connectors on both the inside of the port on the iPhone, as well as on the connector. Now, if we dismiss the fact that APPLE Lightning Cables are absolute ass, and we only focus on the connector itself and not our experience with the item degrading far faster than competing items. We can still see that for a daily mobile use item, lightning is the clearly superior choice. Mobile devices no longer need to transfer data across wires, and Lightning charge times are not significantly inferior to other fast charging times found on USB-C devices in the current generations.

For my own personal feelings after having owned Samsung and iPhones, the Lightning jack is a superior daily jack for mobile devices. The USB-C jack I had ended up eventually ""loosening"" so you could never feel if it was completely plugged in. Lightning on the other hand never loses it's snap.

I know I'm going to get blasted here, because everyone likes to burn apple. But when you sit down and look at the two ports from an objective view, and you disregard any feelings you have about the overall products, Lightning is smaller, less prone to damage, has a better overall user experience, and has many of the same features found in USB-C devices.",,/r/europe/comments/ep1zyi/european_union_wants_all_smartphones_to_have_a/fehvqys/,lmao-this-platform,1579124833

If the EU had implemented this back in the micro-usb days, we would still be stuck with that rather than having USB type C, which is obviously far superior. Device manufacturers shouldn't have to lobby the government in order to change how the device they are making charges, that is insane.

If I am making a smartphone, I shouldn't be forced to use a particular charging port, I should have the freedom to make it however I want, just like people have the freedom to not buy it, so long as it isn't actually dangerous or anything. I can't believe that people don't see this as a massive government overreach. I understand legislating things like requiring a particular plug to be at electric car charging stations, because electric car charging stations are expensive infrastructure that we don't want to have to duplicate many times, but even in that case forcing every car manufacturer to use the same charging port would be an overreach in my opinion.

3180,"Let’s get a few things straight: 

Pretty much with the exception of Apple’s ports, nearly every phone charging port in the last 15 years was invented for something else and adopted by the phone. The various round DC ports that were in phones years ago simply adopted existing DC power adapters. Micro-USB was not invented for phone. Nor was the USB-C adapter. Phone makers generally don’t innovate new ports (again, Apple excluded...though even the current lightning port is basically a form of USB-C), they adopt technology in the field to their phones.

Second, again with the exception of apple, people aren’t making money of phone charging ports. DC round ports were not licensable and been around for decades. Micro-USB and USB-C are both royalty free open standards that basically anyone can use. 

With that in mind, you act like these decisions are all made in a vacuum and that phone makers will he caught flat-footed. In situations on this type of tech adoption, tech manufacturers are virtually always heavily involved in the process, not only to provide expertise to regulators, but also to promote their own interests.

3206,"&gt; French government computers are to adopt the Gallic-funded search engine Qwant as their default browser amid alleged concerns that Google insufficiently protects data privacy.

&gt; Founded in 2013, Qwant is a Franco-German encrypted search engine that functions the same way as Google but doesn’t keep logs and places a heavy emphasis on user privacy.

&gt; It is a minnow compared to the American giant, with an estimated average of 21 million monthly searches compared to Google's roughly 3.5 billion a day.

&gt; The switch to hundreds of thousands of terminals comes as Qwant’s historic chairman, Eric Leandri, is to leave the executive board but will remain shareholder and in charge of its strategic and scientific committee.

&gt; Mr Leandri had come under fire amid reports by Next INpact that Qwant delivered results dating back to 2017 in 2019. It has since fixed the issue but its reputation took a hit. Jean-Claude Ghinozzi, l'actuel current deputy director-general in charge of sales and marketing, will take over.

&gt; President Emmanuel Macron of France recently spoke about the importance of data sovereignty, saying: “If we don’t regulate the internet, we run the risk of upsetting the fundamentals of democracy.”

&gt; The decision to cut Google allegedly stems from Edward Snowden’s NSA leaks back in 2013.

&gt; Last summer, Florian Bachelier, a member of France’s cybersecurity and digital sovereignty task-force, pushed for the change, saying: “We have to set the example. Security and digital sovereignty are at stake here.”

&gt; According to Libération newspaper, a note dating January 7 rubber-stamped the move to Qwant in all French ministries.

&gt; That came after a security audit gave the engine the all-clear.

&gt; Qwant is “the only (search engine) capable of responding to the government’s requirements,” said digital economy minster Cédric O recently.

&gt; The switch is due to take place by April 30.

&gt; The search engine will also be recapitalised by France’s Caisse des Depots and the German group Axel Springer, which together own 35 per cent of Qwant, according to AFP. The precise figure has not been disclosed.

&gt; The extra cash comes after a string of losses, with Qwant losing €11.2 million (£9.5m) in 2018 and €10 million the previous year.

&gt; Qwant says it captures four per cent of French internet searches but independent institutes have put the figure more likely at one per cent.",,/r/europe/comments/ep7d1r/france_to_make_gallic_google_qwant_governments/fehjsxs/,bataneyelid,1579117994

Yet only now its rays have sped
Their journey to our eyes.

Slowly the vault ascended;

3221,"&gt;western europe not so much. you are denying reality because your ego wont allow you to admit you received massive amounts of help from the west. help that was not demanded from the west.

The west absolutely would be worse off than they are now with the EU enlargement. You are the one denying reality, as if the West gave money out of the goodness of their hearts, as if there was anything like ""free money"" in business and politics. Its your ego that makes you think you are somehow superior, that we would have collapsed if the EU hadnt saved us with their generosity.  

&gt;the cohesion funds arent compensation either for the east opening their markets,

No they arent, but that is part of the trade off and how both sides benefit off of the EU.

&gt; Poland alone received more from the west than the west did under the Marshall plan.  

Not sure what your point with this is... 12 billion in the 1940s is completley different (much more) than 20 billion in the 2000s. Dont also forget about the time the West had to develop while the East was forced under communism. Of course EU funds helped Poland and other EE members, but its not some miracle (look for example at [Poland's GDP growth](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=PL) over the years, there was no skyrocketing point that would show joining the EU).

&gt; that it was actually the east that did the west a favour by joining the EU is whats annoying, a lie no one in their right mind believes.

3244,"&gt; With that in mind, you act like these decisions are all made in a vacuum and that phone makers will be caught flat-footed. In situations on this type of tech adoption, tech manufacturers are virtually always heavily involved in the process, not only to provide expertise to regulators, but also to promote their own interests. Any decision on what do use will necessarily have to have industry consensus about what is feasible from both a tech and cost standpoint.

Well not really, it seems like you're the one that's just assuming that the current port solution (driven by threat of lawsuits instead of market forces) is somehow the best possible port solution. 

Ok, so phone manufacturers adopted ports from other fields? Fine. Being able to free ride on someone else's innovation is one of the possible solutions for phone manufacturers. However, it's a solution that can easily be reached through the market (for example Apple + IBM computers using USB-C charging) instead of needing to be legislated. It makes sense for companies to design products that are convenient for consumers to use. Consumers like these.

It can also hinder innovation in the sense that it forces companies who could have come up with better port solutions to basically not do this.

* Renamings in areas annected to Germany in 1939 (mostly: Wartheland in 1940/41 and 1943; northern Mazovia/Regierungsbezirk Zichenau in 1940/41; and Danzig-Westpreussen in 1942/43; interestingly renamings were very rare in Oberschlesien);

* Rare cases of renamings made in General-Gouvernement (where Nazis mostly used Polish names; fun trivia somehow they didn't rename Szczebrzeszyn /famous for tongue-breaking name/, although it was actually started to be settled by German repatriants from Bessarabia).

Why is that important? Well, because while we Poles are generally fine with old historical names like Danzig, Breslau or Stettin – Nazi ones are kind of… triggering. Please don't use them.
Also, fun trivia: some of these new names (especially middle phase), pushed by civil (state/NSDAP) administration were actually ignored by some institutions, like railway or military.

3271,"&gt; Not much, but still something. The people it really hurts though are people in the lower middle class. 

Even poor people pay more direct an dindirect taxes combined if you look at their income percent wise.

For example a worker still drives with his car to his job and while he get's to pay less taxes for that, if he pays 200€ a month for fuel (probably less but it depends on how far he has to go) more than 50% of this is taxes. if he has 500€ after his rent, internet, TV and other periodic stuff (money that is also affected by taxes) it means he spends 1/5 of his fluid money on fuel taxes. If he spends another 50 € in a week for food, he will also pay taxes (like everybody else). The difference is that he doesn't has that much. He can't just stop to eat or stop to pay his rent.

So while he doesn't spend a lot of money for his direct tax, his living expanses are also filled up with taxes so his real % of tax payed is much higher as the well earning mid class guy.

Yeah but low mid class sucks the most because you don't have acces to social helps (living money, or more money if you have kids) while still paying a really high amount of indirect taxes and you can't even abuse tax reductions well like richer people, since you need to spend money first for them and earn enough so your tax can still get reduced.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/eodnx4/germany_posts_record_breaking_budget_surplus_of/fehkwgg/,Are_y0u,1579118623

Yup, you totally don't know context. You're confusing Trotsky's ""Permanent Revolution"" with Stalin's ""Socialism in One Country"".

Molotov-Ribbentrop was a last ditch effort to delay war with the Germans, which was inevitable, both sides knew this. The Nazis wanted the complete extermination of Slavs, Jews and Communists.  
In fact, the Soviets wanted an anti-German alliance together with Britain and France to protect Czechoslovakia and kill Germany before they got powerful enough but instead the West went full appeasement.

Why that was not required in 2008?

&gt; The fact that Russia is a presidential country right now doesn't mean it couldn't switch, in fact that's the subject of our discussion.

No, that is not the subject. PM gets no additional powers in this proposals, the major change is that Parliament now gets to appoint him instead of the President. There are no discussions about changing Russia into parliamentary federation. 

&gt;There's nothing in the proposed legislation? Well I haven't seen it, since you have I would be grateful if you linked me the proposals the Duma will be voting on.

We are discussing the topic based on available data. So I'll word it a bit better. There is nothing that Putin proposed and that was reported on that would make PM more powerful. The rest is just your imagination, and this is not the place to discuss that. 

&gt; By your logic the president is reliant on the people so he couldn't be all that powerful.

During an anti-Israel demonstration in Berlin at the end of 2017, the country's flag was burned. The outrage was great. Now the lighting of flags is made a punishable offence - even if they are painted. Photo: dpa
 
After long hesitation, the coalition now wants to ban the burning of the Israeli flag. At the same time, all other foreign flags are to be protected. There is no separate bill in this matter, only an amendment to the planned improved protection of the EU flag, which the Bundestag is discussing this week. The amendment, which has not yet been published, has been submitted to the Badische Zeitung.

The debate was triggered by several demonstrations in Berlin in December 2017, when there were protests against US President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Some Israeli flags were also burned during the protests. This led to a public outcry, especially when it became clear that this is not yet a criminal offence.

""Those who burn Israeli flags question Israel's right to exist, reject it.""
Joseph Schuster
""Those who burn Israeli flags question Israel's right to exist, reject it,"" said Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. ""Whoever burns Israeli flags, burns our values"", explained the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas (SPD).

Currently, foreign flags are only protected in the penal code if they are officially hung, for example during a state visit. This is regulated in the penal code (paragraph 104). On the other hand, anyone who sets fire to an Israeli, American or Russian flag he or she has brought with them during a demonstration has nothing to fear under criminal law.

Only the German flag is more comprehensively protected under criminal law. According to Paragraph 90a, it may not be destroyed, damaged or denigrated (i.e. disparaged). This also applies to a black-red-golden flag brought along by a person at a demonstration.

""Whoever publicly destroys or damages the flag of a foreign state"" shall be punished

Initially, it was planned to criminalize only the public burning of the Israeli flag. In a statement of March 2018, the Scientific Service of the Bundestag also considered this to be permissible. ""In the light of Germany's continuing, special, historically based responsibility, it does not seem arbitrary to protect the Israeli flag in a special way,"" it said. But then the Israeli embassy in Berlin probably asked to waive a special right only for the Israeli flag.

So now, ""anyone who publicly destroys or damages the flag of a foreign state shall be punished. The burning of the Chinese or Saudi Arabian flag would also be prohibited. There would be a fine or imprisonment for up to two years. This is provided for in a formulation aid of the Federal Government, which was passed in December. It is to be submitted as an amendment by the CDU/CSU and SPD to a related bill of the Bundesrat, which is already on the Bundestag agenda this week on Wednesday.

EU flag to be protected from ""vilification

Here, in a new paragraph 90c, the Federal Council also wants to protect the EU flag and the EU anthem from ""vilification"". The EU flag consists of twelve golden stars on a blue background, the EU anthem ""Joy, beautiful spark of the gods"" is based on Friedrich Schiller's ""Ode to Joy"", which was set to music by Ludwig van Beethoven. This bill had been introduced into the Bundesrat by Saxony. The occasion was a demonstration of the Nazi party ""Der III. Weg"" in Plauen. The right-wing extremists had put an EU flag on the street and marched over it. This required a reaction from the constitutional state, explained Saxony's then Minister of Justice Sebastian Gemkow (CDU). The incident happened last May. Saxony had already presented the bill in June, and in September the state chamber of parliament passed it. Soon it will probably be law.

Before Christmas 2003, in the village of Marotinu de Sus, a 76-year-old  Romanian man named Petre Toma died.

Gheorghe  Marinescu, a brother-in-law, became the leader of a vampire hunting  group made up of several family members.

After removal of the heart, the body was burned and  the ashes mixed in water and drunk by the family, as is customary. However, the Romanian government, anxious to maintain a good image in preparation for the country's accession to the European Union, had banned this practice, and six family members were arrested by the police of Craiova from Dolj County for ""disturbing the peace of the dead"",  and were imprisoned and sentenced to pay damages to the family of the  deceased.

Suddenly, children were surviving and death seemed further away in the future and people didn’t live in daily fear of the Grim reaper. 

By then the church had retreated from attempting to explain the universe to just being a moral guardian, but eventually everyone understood that the church didn’t live what it preached. That reduced role began to undermine the pervasive presence of the church in people’s lives. 

In the 20th century contraceptives pills were invented and every husband and wife saw the church intruding in to their bedroom and ignoring the day-to-day needs of families.  Essentially, the church had turned every husband &amp; wife in to purposeful sinners.  

The combination of the retreat of the church from daily life, it’s failure to be a moral compass and it’s attempt to turn contraceptive using families in to sinners meant that people who once attended church stopped doing do because it became a vaguely humiliating event where you were being preached at by someone who might well be complicit in the rape of children and wanted you to make more of them.",,/r/europe/comments/ep0z7p/why_has_europe_lost_its_faith_why_are_the_great/fegdgos/,ShootingPains,1579088785

Also, these regulations usually come from the will of the member states themselves and/or are adopted to improve the quality of life of European citizens. There is a discussion which can be had there and I am strongly on the side that EU regulations by and large have increased quality of life and are worth the small tradeoff in direct sovereignty.

I have a neurological autoimmune condition that causes demyleanation and was hospitalized in France when my first flare happened and I became entirely blind and paralyzed.  I am from the US. AMA. 

In the US my insurance that cost $400USD a month denied me basic treatment for my disease claiming that neither blindness or paralysis were life threatening. Even though I had insurance, we got stuck with 120k bill just for diagnosis, which I already had from France but they wanted one done stateside. The treatments were like 50k a pop twice yearly after insurance. I wasn’t able to receive even basic physio therapy in the US because it’s “not necessary.”

3709,"People get upset when subsidies go to expensive cars, luxury vegan food, solar panel installations that cost thousands etc. But every new technology pretty much has to start as a high-margin luxury product. You have to find a niche where it can grow and build an ecosystem and manufacturing capabilities around it, and you need to do that at a point where everything is still expensive and inefficient.

Tesla has *completely* changed the electric vehicle market. Even if they never build a car below 30000$, the example of their success and the investments it has spawned (as well as the harsher government targets that have now been set) has probably accelerated the arrival of electric cars in every price category by at least 5 years.

Likewise, food. In ten years everybody will be barbecuing 10 cent vegan burgers that taste better than the cheap real ones today, and it's all because of those 10$ vegan patties and million-dollar-research-burgers you see right now.

You can't take shortcuts on that, well not unless you want to feed everybody on soylent or other slurry, or ban private car ownership altogether.

We definitely need to look out for working class people, but I feel like in some cases the injustices are inflated for political reasons.

&gt;It's hard to give final cost when no modern reactors were recently finished in EU

Yes this decade will Show us, what the future of nuclear fission will be in the EU. But I think calculating against cost of the Climate Change, cost should matter after we are Carbon neutral.

&gt;In Czech Republic it's ~€2.2 per MWh for waste management. Unfortunately I don't know about any cost assessments for decommission modern nuclear power plants. However companies at least have to create reserves for decommissioning unlike for other types power plants.

For Germany there is also no numbers, even many think the fund from Energy companies is to low in Germany. Only time will tell.

I mean, I get it, to an extent, but all this does is help the SNP in the long run.

I'm not sure it does. The UK government has been refusing another referendum for the last two years and it doesn't seem to have had any effect on the polling. Remember, there is a long term small majority to stay in the UK, independence has minority support.

I don't really see an alternative, either. Holding a referendum during the Brexit process would be harmful to the rest of the UK as well as increasing the chance of a freak result in Scotland.

&gt;And Remain led the polls for most of the year prior to Brexit

From the beginning of the campaign to the end there were 35 opinion polls giving a lead to remain, 33 a lead for leave. 

&gt;Independence/secession isn't merely a question of constitutional change, however. Requiring supermajorities or a minimum turnout requirement for such referenda is malpractice. The Venice Commission recommends a simple majority vote without any such qualifiers.

I'm not in favour of supermajorities either. But I'm also not in favour of trying to bring about a major constitutional change during another major constitutional change when it has already been rejected at the ballot box only a few years earlier. 

One thing at a time. Independence was put before the people of Scotland in 2014 and rejected. If the SNP want to try again, despite polls (and elections) showing a majority still opposed, they should wait until Brexit is done and a clear future can be put before the electorate.",,/r/europe/comments/eojyjg/scottish_independence_uk_government_rejects/feg8q85/,WhiteSatanicMills,1579082430

3733,"&gt; Right, so Finland is not periphery but Italy is.

Actually, Finland *is* in the periphery, as its geographically understood, but its economic fundamentals have more in common with the core, so most people don't generally mean to include it when discussing the topic.

&gt; Firstly Greece is its own unique set of issues mostly unrelated to EU

Wrong. Yes, Greece's issues are idiosyncratic to some degree, however it's their membership of the Euro totally precludes the resolution of the most significant. Whilst Greece remains within the Eurozone, their insanely high debt-to-gdp level isn't going anywhere, and so neither is their interest coverage burden they are therefore forced to bear. This makes it impossible for the country to meaningfully invest or spend in a way that will stimulate long term sustainable growth. The common currency will be a permanent millstone around the neck of the Greek economy for as long as they stay in it. Next big recession Greece will once again be on the edge of default, capital markets won't lend to them and the misery will continue.

&gt; Secondly those growth figures aren't that far off from, say, Finlands growth.

Finland is a laggard as far as the core goes. However, Finland doesn't have the same high levels of unemployment as periphery countries, nor does it have the same debt problems. 

&gt; Thirdly, and most importantly, if you really want to view the gap you take the poorest third and compare it with the richest third. You don't cherry pick some middle of the pack countries.

I didn't cherry pick anything, I took pretty much the *entirety* of the periphery, at leas the most significant and populous countries. For the core, I did likewise, I looked at some large northern european states. Honestly, I have no idea what you are trying to say here, if I chose the best performing core countries the disparity would be even more dramatic and my argument would have even more weight behind it.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/eomgzq/brexit_will_soon_have_cost_the_uk_more_than_all/feg8uiq/,MyFavouriteAxe,1579082600

3764,"&gt; You forgot that i was in there.

I don't, I simply don't find personal anecdotes useful. 

&gt;There are a lot of those that really can't leave without changing everything, including life long friends. And there are those that can leave just fine. Shunning is one thing that can be very different just in different regions.

Some people die of cancer some don't. Cancer is still bad. I'm glad that some people are able to leave. But the system it self, the rules of the cults most certainly designed to make it as hard as possible.

&gt;And how is this different from baptizing when you are few weeks old?

Who cares about baptizm? Certainly not the people who lost faith and decided to quit. How can this be compared to isolation from outside world? 

&gt;I am staunchly against indoctrinating religion to kids. 

That we can agree on. 

&gt;But that is the fucking modus operandi in ALL religions.

Indeed, but that's why isolation is the problem. Yes, kids get indoctrinated, but they then get to go outside and participate in wider society and get exposed to new ideas. Cults deny that to their members. 

&gt;You do not want to be one of those that are badmouthing JWs on a post that is about oppressing JWs for real... It will sound, not that it has this far but it can sound like you are making excuses for that oppression.

I'm not making excuses, I'm saying that stopping the spread of such cults is a good thing.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for freedom of worship. But cults like JW go beyond that, they establish their own rules that go against human rights, that's the red line. That's where they should be stopped. And no one will bother you, not even in Russia if you worship whomever you want. It's when you start advertising it and spreading it and recruiting new members into your cult this is when authorities will get you. Otherwise, if you simply pray at your own time, authorities will simply have no idea whom you worship. There is no mind-reading machine...


&gt;It is in the right direction for sure but life inside is not that bad as it is made to sound. You forget that most of JWs.. WANT TO BE IN THERE and know exactly the things you said.

Are you familiar with Stockholm syndrome? Stanford prison experiment? Human psyche is a complicated thing, and cults exploit it to keep people subjugated. 

&gt; By far the most difficulty was causing a deep, deep disappointment to my parents. Hearing my father cry is still the worst day of my life.

Yeah, that's indeed one of the ways that cults keep people in basically psychological prisons. Yes, there are no fences and gates, but there are all your friends and all your family that is held hostage, and if you leave, you hurt everyone you know and love.  


&gt;And that is inherent in all close knit sects.

And all of the such sects that discourage contact with outside world are terrible predatory cults and should be banned. 

Again, most of your comment is about how terrible JW is:  It's hard to leave it, you were lucky that your parents didn't shun you, you still had to hurt them in order to leave, you had to lose your friends and change your whole life. 

This is not normal. This is bad. Majority of people don't have to go through it. And some people wouldn't be able to go through it. That's why the world would be a much better place if those cults did not exist. And Russian authorities simply try to make Russia a better place.",,/r/europe/comments/enrotl/fsb_raids_homes_of_yehovahs_witnesses_in_murmansk/feg95iq/,temperok,1579083034

&gt;No, I'm talking about the stuff that's been discussed for the MKS 180, and which appears on the design. While the final armaments aren't known, what has been suggested still makes it very underarmed for its size.

If you are interested in such details you probably should read some history books how this was handled in the GDR and the other countries.
I guess its very obvious that such huge decision and change would be an process which includes the democratic process of an election and an specific period of time where everything i getting prepared... stuff like an constitution.
So everyone in the country would be aware of the upcoming changes and could react to it.

Anyways.. with you saying things like ""As expected it didn't take you long to show the undemocratic, oppressive true nature of Socialism."" just shows me that you only wanna hate on socialism.. and not interested in talking about it... otherwise you wouldnt judge the whole thing on what i write here in an reddit discussion.

Btw.. if you spend so much time on such discussion.. you should start to spend at least some time to read up what socialism mean and stop making a fool of you with sentence like.. ""What you are describing is a dictatorship but instead of a dictator you have the people.""
You cant be serious to write down stuff like that if you would have yourself taken time to think about it.

Its even more funny you complain about the possibility what would happen if just 51% of the people decide to change the system.. with having ""real life examples"" like an Brexit.. which is an huge decision for the country to.. decided by such percentages.. or take almost ANY of the last elections in the US which which came out similarly close.

Also hilarious is that you state the people become refugees.. while we already talked about the decisions everyone has to make an its their choice to leave.. 
I mean capitalism forcing millions of people via an war.. with killing everything on sight.. to flee and become refugees.. and you seriously complain about an democratic process where everyone make his own decision and have time to prepare for it .. still pretending socialism is sooo bad.. and capitalism is good? 

Can you tell me how i should continue this discussion if you showed over the whole time of the discussion that you are not willing to talk seriously about this?
You refuse to get basic knowledge about the terms.
You blame socialism to be bad because of my comments.
You totally ignore similiar things happen in capitalism.. while claiming socialism is bad because of such things.
You just keep stating predictions while totally ignoring what ive explained before.
Thats no base for an further discussion.

And if you dont realize that from the start of this discussion you only tryed to proof your point by yourself.. no matter what i said or the definitions says.. nor reading things up how they happened back then... thats just ridiculous. 
I hope you are not that stupid.

3830,"It's reporting like this which has led to the deterioration of political culture in the UK to the point where the public feel like they can ignore all ""expert"" opinion.

It has been a consistent theme of Brexit journalism that ""growth forgone"" is reported as a direct cost. You saw it especially in the pre-referendum economic models of Brexit. The models all said something along the lines of ""Britain's economy will still grow, but it will grow at a lower rate than if Britain had remained in the EU"". The models were therefore conducting a comparison of two hypotheticals, each of which was premised on a raft of assumptions.

How were those models reported? ""Brexit will make the average Briton poorer by £X"". It's economically illiterate and, in some cases, deliberately misleading.

You see the same thing happening in this article. The method used is to compare the growth of the British economy with a basket of other economies around the world and to assume that British growth would have tracked with the growth of those economies had Brexit not occurred. That's a pretty dubious methodology, but putting that aside: the ""cost"" being reported is not a literal cost in the sense of having money and then losing it. It is growth forgone. 

This is a practical problem as well as a failure to uphold intellectual honesty. Because when the people are bombarded with newstories telling them that they are poorer, but none of those stories ring true (i.e. the people do not feel poorer), then the natural and inevitable conclusion is that you can safely ignore economic reporting, which will appear to bear no relation to an individual's financial position. 

And thus you end up in a situation where people dismiss genuine expertise because it is so obscured by a cloud of intellectual dishonesty that it's impossible for the average person to distinguish between true expertise and all the nonsense.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/eomgzq/brexit_will_soon_have_cost_the_uk_more_than_all/feg3iy7/,Taure,1579075311

3911,"Ehhh.  I mean, people have promoted a lot of reasons for the fall, but Rome paying barbarians to do the bulk of the fighting and their limited loyalty has been cited by a number of people as a factor in the fall of the Roman Empire.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire#376%E2%80%93395;_invasions,_civil_wars,_and_religious_discord

&gt;Battle of Adrianople
&gt;
&gt;In 376 the East faced an enormous barbarian influx across the Danube, mostly Goths who were refugees from the Huns. They were exploited by corrupt officials rather than effectively resettled, and they took up arms, joined by more Goths and by some Alans and Huns. Valens was in Asia with his main field army, preparing for an assault on the Persians, and redirecting the army and its logistic support would have required time. Gratian's armies were distracted by Germanic invasions across the Rhine. In 378 Valens attacked the invaders with the Eastern field army, perhaps some 20,000 men – possibly only 10% of the soldiers nominally available in the Danube provinces[66] – and in the Battle of Adrianople, 9 August 378, he lost much of that army and his own life. All of the Balkan provinces were thus exposed to raiding, without effective response from the remaining garrisons who were ""more easily slaughtered than sheep"".[66] Cities were able to hold their own walls against barbarians who had no siege equipment, and they generally remained intact although the countryside suffered.[67]
&gt;
&gt;Partial recovery in the Balkans
&gt;
&gt;Gratian appointed a new Augustus, a proven general from Hispania called Theodosius. During the next four years, he partially re-established the Roman position in the East.[68][69] These campaigns depended on effective imperial coordination and mutual trust – between 379 and 380 Theodosius controlled not only the Eastern empire, but also, by agreement, the diocese of Illyricum.[70] Theodosius was unable to recruit enough Roman troops, relying on barbarian warbands without Roman military discipline or loyalty. In contrast, during the Cimbrian War, the Roman Republic, controlling a smaller area than the western Empire, had been able to reconstitute large regular armies of citizens after greater defeats than Adrianople, and it ended that war with the near-extermination of the invading barbarian supergroups, each recorded as having more than 100,000 warriors (with allowances for the usual exaggeration of numbers by ancient authors).[71] Theodosius's partial failure[72][73] may have stimulated Vegetius to offer advice on re-forming an effective army (the advice may date from the 390s[74] or from the 430s[75]):
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From the foundation of the city till the reign of the Emperor Gratian, the foot wore cuirasses and helmets. But negligence and sloth having by degrees introduced a total relaxation of discipline, the soldiers began to think their armor too heavy, as they seldom put it on. They first requested leave from the Emperor to lay aside the cuirass and afterwards the helmet. In consequence of this, our troops in their engagements with the Goths were often overwhelmed with their showers of arrows. Nor was the necessity of obliging the infantry to resume their cuirasses and helmets discovered, notwithstanding such repeated defeats, which brought on the destruction of so many great cities. Troops, defenseless and exposed to all the weapons of the enemy, are more disposed to fly than fight. What can be expected from a foot-archer without cuirass or helmet, who cannot hold at once his bow and shield; or from the ensigns whose bodies are naked, and who cannot at the same time carry a shield and the colors? The foot soldier finds the weight of a cuirass and even of a helmet intolerable. This is because he is so seldom exercised and rarely puts them on.[76] 
&gt;
&gt;The final Gothic settlement was acclaimed with relief,[69] even the official panegyrist admitting that these Goths could not be expelled or exterminated, nor reduced to unfree status.[77] Instead they were either recruited into the imperial forces, or settled in the devastated provinces along the south bank of the Danube, where the regular garrisons were never fully re-established.[78] In some later accounts, and widely in recent work, this is regarded as a treaty settlement, the first time that barbarians were given a home within the Empire in which they retained their political and military cohesion.[79] No formal treaty is recorded, nor details of whatever agreement was actually made; when the Goths are next mentioned in Roman records, they have different leaders and are soldiers of a sort.[80] In 391 Alaric, a Gothic leader, rebelled against Roman control. Goths attacked the emperor himself, but within a year Alaric was accepted as a leader of Theodosius's Gothic troops and this rebellion was over.[81] 

-

&gt; The ineffectiveness of Roman military responses from Stilicho onwards has been described as ""shocking"",[91] with little evidence of indigenous field forces or of adequate training, discipline, pay, or supply for the barbarians who formed most of the available troops. Local defence was occasionally effective, but was often associated with withdrawal from central control and taxes; in many areas, barbarians under Roman authority attacked culturally-Roman ""Bagaudae"".[92][93][94]

3975,"What? The King hasnt had any formal powers since the 70-ies, and i have no idea where you got the rest from lol. I studied history and wrote a paper on press coverage on the representation reform of 1865, where i analyzed the coverage from 3 different newsletters, Aftonbladet, Nya Dagligt Allehanda (later turned into expressen) and Wäktaren. Wäktaren in particular was a christian conservative paper which most certaintly didnt hold anything back when it came to critizicing the state and there are no records of the state stepping in to censoring them as far as im aware. The last time the King used his authority to supress press coverage was when they tried to stop aftonbladet to critizise them during the 1830-ies, which failed since everytime they got banned they simply renamed the paper, from Aftonbladet to The second Aftonbladet (det andra aftonbladet) to The third Aftonbladet (det tredje aftonbladet) etc.

Sweden was the first country to introduce a constitutional law which guaranteed the freedom of the press in 1766 ( later updated in the Free press statue of 1812 ), though the state still had some means to controll newspapers at this time. When these measures proved ineffective against papers like Aftonbladet they decided to abolish these measures. But sure, everyone to the right of stalin is censored and free speach literally doesnt exist here.

She then tried to bring attention to the story by going directly to the media.  
&gt;  
&gt;Andrew Malcolm, a reporter for the London Times, saw the press release written by Cryer but ultimately decided not to write about the story because he didn’t want to provide fodder for the British National Party, which was gaining support at the time. “To my shame I allowed my liberal fear about giving succor and credence to the British National Party to act as a break on actually doing my job,” Malcolm told the BBC.

This year is exactly eighty years since German political scientist Ernst Fraenkel (1898-1975) wrote his famous book *The Dual State.* *A Contribution to the Theory of Dictatorship* . In contemporary literature, this work is considered, next to the *Roots of totalitarianism* Hannah Arendt and *Behemoth* Franz Neumann, to be the most thorough and accurate analysis of the essence of the state system and the law of the Third Reich.

Fraenkel had graduated out of necessity in exile in the United States in mid-1940 and then published in English in early 1941, but a sketch of his very accurate diagnosis was made in Germany in the mid-1930s.

The work in German, however, appeared only in 1974, but it had a very distinctive, slightly different than in the original English version, the subtitle: *Doppelstaat.* *Recht und Justiz im ""Dritten Reich"".*

Indeed, the *Dual State* table of contents already shows that it is not so much about the Nazi dictatorship in general, it is about the theory and practice of three elements under the conditions of this dictatorship:

**first** , the law and justice system;

**secondly** , necessary transformations in the science of law;

**thirdly** , the real functioning of law and justice.

## Double country

However, the main title, both in English and German, is identical: *The Dual State, Doppelstaat* .

The special value of Fraenkel's work consists mainly in showing a specific phenomenon: here, on the ruins of the gradually disassembled Weimar Republic, the Third Reich arises and

&gt;**begins the process of parallel operation of two states, or rather two political and legal orders.**

One maintains the theoretical normative appearances of some minimal institutional and procedural continuation, the other parallel builds a completely different and new system.

*Prima facie* \[at first glance -red\] one, in fact two countries.

Ernst Fraenkel, of course, was analyzing a specific country at a specific time - Germany in 1933-1938. However, if we removed from his text all elements that allow to identify the phenomenon of the ""double state"" in time and space, then one could be tempted to do some thought experiment, with full awareness of the dangers that accompany it.

## Disassembly mechanism

Let's try to look at Fraenkel's insightful analysis for certain, using the methodology of John Rawls from his *Theory of Justice,* a *veil of ignorance* .

We do not know what specific historical events are about *The Dual State* , we are only interested in a certain mechanism of dismantling the rule of law. And then let's get out of this veil and try to confront what the author has presented us with what we now want and expect, considering our historical experiences.

We may be horrified to discover that, despite the gigantic dissonance between these two perspectives,

&gt;**Someone nowadays, in an anachronistic way, offers us, consciously or not, a new life in a ""dual state"".**

As part of the thought experiment constructed in this way, we could start reading *The Dual State* as if *á rebours* as a kind of instruction on how to implement the following process: how to gradually quench - to use the formulation of prof. Ewa Łętowska - a democratic state of law and replace it with a completely different political and legal order.",,/r/europe/comments/eovcuj/professor_sting_double_state_in_addition_to_a/fefbmod/,bm52oc,1579052757
4065,"You put an individual into a box of ""you guys"", or ""you people"" as if they represent a whole homogeneous nation and you go on building a whole strawman out if it.

4066,"Let us point out only a few elements resulting in this instruction from some chapters of the work of Ernst Fraenkel. What do you have to do?

**First of all** , the approach to the essence of law should be changed: it is not about norms, it is about necessary current prerogatives of power.

**Secondly,** it is necessary to gradually abolish all constitutional, and over time, and statutory restrictions on such prerogatives of the authorities, especially the police authorities.

**Thirdly, the** means of any judicial review of the authority's exercise of its prerogatives should be eliminated.

**Fourth** , the ruling party should have a decisive role in the exercise of power.

**Fifthly** , the goal of the law in terms of power prerogatives should be politics.

That's all for starters as an encouragement to deeper reading of *The Dual State.* Paradoxically, I was prompted to write this short column not only by the anniversary of this work.

The second reason is much more banal, although it is a kind of shame. The representatives of the Venice Commission visited Poland a few days ago and were very differently received. Differently because they came to a ""dual state"".

* The EU has the constraint that each country needs to build a military capable of operating on its own, and that's a serious constraint.  The US doesn't have that constraint (well, mostly...the states do have their own military forces, but they aren't as separated as in the EU).

* Various countries in the EU would probably would still like to maintain the autonomy of their defense industry.  My guess is that France is still gonna be hesitant to be in a position where, I dunno, Hungary might get pissed off with France and cut off France's supply of something.  So that's another constraint.

* The US spends a larger proportion of her GDP on her military than does the EU.  [Grabbing the first year for which Google pulls up a hit, because the EU doesn't seem to have a nice military spending summary each year](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20180518-1): ""In 2016, the EU's 28 Member States earmarked €200 billion of public expenditure for 'defence'. This is equivalent to 1.3% of GDP. ""  [Looking at the World Bank data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS?locations=US), the US spent 3.2% of GDP on her military in 2016.

* The US has a slightly-larger GDP at the moment, though I doubt that that's the dominant factor; in percentage terms, they're not far off each other.  For 2019, the US was [$21.439 trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), and the EU was [$18.8 trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union).

For space, I'm guessing that the US also spends more.  *Googles*.  Yup.

&gt; The annual budget of the European Space Agency, with around 22 member states that make contributions, is around $6.6 billion US dollars.
&gt;
&gt;The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which once got as much as 4% of the US national budget during the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo era, now has to schlep along on only 1/2 of 1% of the US budget.

4106,"&gt;I'd kindly suggest you take up a long, long period of silence on your behalf for your spout of bollocks is so condescending one could imagine a king died and the masses, who by the way you have such high opinion of, have made you a king.

The fuck are you going on about?

&gt; There is no sacrifice of the International Law when all refugees are in the safe country (Turkey). 

Turkey is not a safe country, which is evident if you follow reports on what is actually happening in the camps these people have been living in and the conditions there; Turkey cannot properly care for millions of refugees, which is why people have been holed up in unsanitary and inhumane conditions for half a decade and are dying from said conditions, not to mention that many of them are Kurds. 

&gt; Only law-breaking is done, as I mentioned before, by the economic migrants slowly heading to the West. 

How would you know? You don't know if these people have a legitimate reason to seek asylum until they do, which they can only do once they cross the border. Hence why crossing borders in order to seek asylum is not a crime. You're just implying that every single one of them does it for purely economic reasons because it fits your narrative.

&gt; European culture is delicate and cannot simply assimilate millions of  quote-unquote brown people in the same manner the American  naturalisation process would have done, for European culture is not that  of a melting pot of various, unconnected peoples, but that of the  people who inhabit its lands and know all the norms intrinsically - a  place where they'll always have a sense of belonging. 

Tell that to the Romans. But besides that fact that that is utter bollocks, seeking asylum does not infer a right for indefinite state, there is nothing that would prevent Schengen members from sending them back once conditions improve.

&gt; If you want to run an entire continent based on morality, then I have  some rather unsavoury news for you: it's a recipe for disaster. 

Beats running it on fear from people who look different if you ask me. 

&gt; (they're a drain and do not contribute to the pension funds - while they get older and sicker) 

See above, no one says they need to stay. Besides that most EU countries have a hard time sustaining their population levels as it is, and pension funds are going to go belly up in the next few decades anyway because we don't breed enough of those pure, ethnic Europeans you hold in such high regard. 

&gt; (more housing and resources are spent on them) 

About time governments invested locally, too bad it had to take a refugee crisis to do it. And isn't this entire threat about a surplus and how we could spend that on housing?

&gt; (towards the existing Europeans who are jobless and homeless within their respective countries) 

Who do you think is going to build all the housing for those millions of refugees? 

&gt;You talk about constitution, but  you're just regurgitating the same line over and over despite it being  fairly obvious that the constitution doesn't work for the criminals  crossing borders, also known in your circles as ""refugees"".

### All back! Court of Justice withdraws purge in Supreme Court [Content and explanation of decisions]

October 19, 2018

""This will be comparable to the elements of the interim measure on the retirement age of SN judges. There, in addition to restoring judges to adjudicate, there was talk of suspending the application of the provisions of the Act, so that subsequent judges would not retire in the meantime ""- explains dr hab. Piotr Bogdanowicz from the Faculty of Law and Administration of the University of Warsaw.

The previous time, after ordering the interim measure, the PiS government argued that it was forced to change the provisions of the Supreme Court Act. According to Piotr Bogdanowicz, suspension of the provisions of the Act will not require any legal steps on the Polish side.

""If we have a request to suspend the application of the law, this measure works directly. There will be no need for legislative action. The provisions of applicable laws - on the structure of common courts and the Supreme Court - will be suspended as regards disciplinary proceedings, ""he emphasizes.

When will the Court decide?

Bogdanowicz: ""The order is issued by the Tribunal. But it can be just like when judges retire. The President or Vice President may make a provisional decision on his own, without the participation of the parties. We could expect such a decision in days. ""

What will happen in practice to the disciplines recognized by the Chamber if its work is stopped?

""The proceedings in the Disciplinary Chamber should be suspended, they will not continue. This, of course, depends on whether the Court agrees to her request and what ultimately orders, ""emphasizes Bogdanowicz.

4144,"I’m a 30odd year old Brit with a Latvian fiancée, she’s been here for 9 years.

I voted for Brexit, she would have done to if she could.

I voted Brexit because it’s a pyramid scheme which will topple shortly. The people at the bottom Latvia, Lithuania etc all have a sell by date, given by the big economies in Europe; Britain, Germany, France.

Google Latvia’s minimum wage then compare to France/UK/Germany etc

How can Latvia in a “free trade economy”, but importantly where the organisation that they’re part of (EU) imposes the same levies and tariffs on materials/products, ever be anything more than the “labour work horse” of the countries like the UK, Germany, France.

The rules are supposedly the same. The free trade is the same BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES WITHIN THE EU, the currency is the same. 

So how on earth can the minimum wage not be?

£8.21 is the minimum wage in Britain, now hypothetically this goes up to £10.21 tomorrow but not in Wales this stays the same £8.21.

Where do the manufacturing companies suddenly start springing up? 

It gets worse for Latvia, the EU wants to add more countries such as Albania. 

Google the average wage of Albanians. 

Ok, so we’re all agreed the wage disparity between Latvians and the British/French/Germans is wrong but where now does Nike Germany get their clothes manufactured? Where does the largest bike seller in France get their bikes assembled? Latvia or Albania? Will the manufacturers in Germany/France try and compete? No! They will instead start having their bikes made in Albania.

Latvians will they go into Banking/Finance/Robotics/Tech or will they instead be forced to lower their margins and keep the minimum wages low?

The one thing I will say, me and my Mrs would never have met (or it would be a lot less likely) is she wasn’t able to come here due to the free movement rule. I’m grateful for this, although I hate the EU free movement rule. Are we working towards stopping racism/prejudice? “Ok, so you Mr you’re from just outside the EU. Stop, go back you can’t easily move across this border and have a nice life for you and your kids,You however fellow EU citizen you can come in, bring your family.”? Really?! One of my grandparents happened to be Indian, her relatives (albeit they were happy being Catholic British Indians) wouldn’t be given the same rights in this country now as a German? In fact a German would be treated considerably better? Why? Whichever side of the fence you sit on with regards the British Empire Good or Bad Britain owes the commonwealth countries a debt of gratitude.

My Mrs “No, it needs to stop there are idiots and no hopes coming from Latvia now who are happy to live in squalor, they’re the reason why people paint me in a bad light. How many other people, other than Russians and ones from neighbouring countries did you see living in Latvia?

4161,"This simple question is one that entire books can be written on. It’s very complex and some of the reasons are even fairly obscure.

To start, the territory that modern Austria encompasses was originally inhabited nearly exclusively by Celts (who were, ironically, once the most widely distributed Indo-European group of peoples, stretching from Iberia in the west to parts of Anatolia in the east). Eventually, the Romans arrived (by the 1st century AD) and set up forts and outposts and minor settlements in the Provinces of Raetia, Noricum, and Pannonia (these three Provinces contained the entire land area of present-day Austria). However, these provinces were also located at the northern and eastern frontiers of the Roman Empire. At this time in Europe, the continent found itself beset by various wandering groups of people, such as Sarmatians, Avars (of Indo-Iranian origin), early Slavs (who at this time spoke a single language, Proto-Slavic, until probably the 12th century), Huns, and Germanic peoples. The Province of Pannonia, with its capital Carnuntum, became the centre of Germanic invasion in the late 2nd century, chiefly by the Marcomanni. It is believed that Marcus Aurelius (one of the ‘Five Good Emperors’) died whilst on campaign against the Marcomanni in what is now modern Lower Austria in around 180 AD (likely at Vindobona, on which parts of modern Vienna stand). If you’ve seen the film Gladiator, be aware that the opening is set nearby Vindobona and the attacking ‘barbarians’ are presumably Marcomanni.

Eventually Slavs, who arrived from somewhere in the east, began to settle in what is now Lower Austria, Carinthia, and Styria. This is very obvious just from place names alone, which although usually germanised, are of Slavic origin (such as Graz). Most of present-day Austria became part of East Francia (or vassals) after the devision of the Carolingian Empire. Finally, in 962, the Holy Roman Empire was founded by Otto I. The Holy Roman Empire at its core was comprised of what is now termed the Kingdom of Germany, which in turn was divided into hundreds of smaller states, which were weakly united, and often fought each other. The Holy Roman Empire was technically ruled by the Holy Roman Emperor (styled as either King of the Romans or King of the Germans, the difference between the two titles being an even more complicated affair), who was elected by his vassals, usually the Electors (there were seven Electors). After a long Interregnum in the mid 13th century following the death of Frederick / Friedrich II in 1250, who died heirless and excommunicated, the Habsburgs, probably the most famous and historically significant royal dynasty in European, and possibly even world history, first came to prominence. During the Interregnum (which technically lasted decades), the nobility competed with itself with hopes of being elected King of the Germans (and eventually crowned as Holy Roman Emperor). Richard von Cornwall, the son of John I (who signed the Magna Carta in 1215) and brother of Henry III (the longest reigning British monarch for nearly 600 years, until Victoria), became King of the Romans in 1257. However, he was never Holy Roman Emperor, nor was his successor, Rudolf I (the first Habsburg King of the Romans). With the rise of the Habsburgs, the electoral system of the Holy Roman Empire ceased to have a legitimate function besides ceremonial purposes, as the Habsburgs ensured the throne would pass hereditarily to other Habsburgs.

Anyways, reversing in time a bit, a large portion of modern Austria (excluding Tyrol, Vorarlberg, and Salzburg, the latter which being part of Altbaiern and remained so for a very long time, eventually becoming an archbishopric) was founded as a March of the Duchy of Bavaria, until 1156, when Austria became a duchy in its own right. The ruling house of the Duchy of Austria at the time were the Babenbergs, who also ruled Styria. The Babenbergs eventually went extinct following the death of Friedrich II in battle (not to be confused with the Hohenstaufen Friedrich II), and the King of Bohemia himself, Ottokar II, became Duke of Austria. Despite his attempts to become Holy Roman Empire, he also failed. Ottokar II was eventually killed in 1278 (Battle on the Marchfeld), fighting the Habsburg Rudolf I. The first new Holy Roman Empire in over 60 years turned out to be the Luxembourg Heinrich VII (whose son was John the Blind / Johann der Blinde, King of Bohemia, who died fighting the English at the Battle of Crecy in 1346. His son, Charles / Karl IV, turned Prague into a great and imperial city and founded the first university in the Holy Roman Empire, Charles University, in 1348).

However, the first Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor would follow a century later, with Friedrich III being crowned as such in 1453. From this point, all subsequent Holy Roman Emperors with two exceptions (who were still related by marriage) were Habsburgs. Thus, the most powerful man (or woman, not excluding Maria Theresia) in the HRE for almost 400 consecutive years was a Habsburg. In addition, the Spanish Empire eventually became inherited by the Habsburgs and Spain experienced its Golden Age under Habsburg rule. The parts of Hungary not taken over by the Ottomans after the Battle of Mohács in 1526, were also inherited by the Habsburgs (thus beginning the relationship between Austria and Hungary that lasted until 1918). 

Austria never directly possessed any overseas territories (at least, not really, excluding the tiny possession in China), but profited from the Spanish Colonisation of the Americas, since Charles V / Karl V was simultaneously King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor (and of course, he was a Habsburg). So, basically, Austria was pretty much the most powerful nation in the world in the 16th century, indirectly through Spain. The Spanish Habsburgs, claiming the title Duke of Burgundy (Charles the Bold was technically the last actual Duke of Burgundy, until a Swiss peasant put a halberd through his head in 1477), also inherited a large portion of the Low Countries (Spanish Netherlands). 

The Spanish Habsburgs went extinct in 1700, partially as a result of their extensive inbreeding. The last Spanish Habsburg, Charles II, was unfortunate enough to possess the so-called ‘Habsburg lip.’ His death sparked the War of the Spanish Succession, and subsequently the Bourbons inherited the Spanish throne (to which they still hold it today).",Austria,/r/europe/comments/eop249/what_do_you_know_about_austria/fefkq33/,Sturmgewehr_44,1579058389

&gt;	Gay marriage has not been around for thousands of years in all over the world, with no negative effects. Fifteen years is nothing compared to that experience.

Circular logic. 

&gt;	Most people who don’t want children don’t marry at all. There’s just no need to.

Even if that was true (it isn‘t), why does that mean they‘re not allowed to?

&gt;	On the other hand, what improved when marriage was redefined?

~5% of the population now have the same rights regarding adoption, inheritance, visiting rights etc. as the other 95%, again, with no negative consequences for the 95%. 

&gt;	Nothing much. Why redefine something that’s worked for as long as there was history, for no tangible benefit at all?

&gt; LONDON (AP) — Will Big Ben bong for Brexit? Not unless British taxpayers cough up the bucks.
&gt; 
&gt; The bell of Britain’s Parliament has been largely silent since 2017 while its iconic clock tower undergoes four years of repairs. Brexit-backing lawmakers are campaigning for it to strike at the moment Britain leaves the European Union - 11 p.m. (2300GMT) on Jan. 31.
&gt; 
&gt; Parliamentary officials say it is not worth the cost, which could run to 500,000 pounds ($650,000). The House of Commons Commission, which oversees the repair work, said Tuesday that because the clock mechanism has been dismantled and the belfry is currently getting a new floor, arranging for Big Ben’s bell to ring “could result in huge costs to the public purse.”
&gt; 
&gt; “You are talking about 50,000 pounds ($65,000) a bong,” House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said. “We also have to bear in mind that the only people who will hear it will be those who live near or are visiting Westminster.”
&gt; 
&gt; But bell-loving Brexit-backers have not given up hope. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Tuesday that “we’re looking at whether the public can fund it.” He said the government was considering a “bung a bob for a Big Ben bong” fund so people who want to can contribute. “Bung” is an informal term for toss, while a bob is slang for a shilling, a former British unit of currency.
&gt; 
&gt; However, the prime minister’s spokesman, James Slack said the government was not planning to set up a specific crowd-funding campaign for Big Ben. But he said “if the public wants Big Ben to bong and the money is raised then that is great.”
&gt; 
&gt; The 15-ton (13.7 metric ton) bell first rang out in 1859 and its deep bongs at the top of each hour have become a symbol of British democracy. Since 2017 it has struck only on special occasions such as Remembrance Day and New Year’s Eve.

I'm sure if you offered England the option to rule over the United States and be the boss of them, they would graciously accept.

But it’s been going on for almost 2 years now in France with protesting from yellow vest now the unions. All he wants to do is kill time meaning Macron pass laws so that his friends from the insurance company’s can make a profit with retirements, and introduce a capitalist base system like the US, and we all see how the us is going when it comes to retirement healthcare going to the hospital is what depends like 10k$ to have a baby there.

Umm I don't know quite anything about post WWII Ireland, but you can't compare today's UK as the 10th economy in the world, where the median wage it's around 35k euros in a globalised economy and has one of the highest standard living ... that can pull her own trousers and compete with EU and US as Ireland did 40-50 years ago in the current context of globalisation, considering that UK's path is one of deregulation that means to compete with other emerging nations for a slice of the cake *with those blocks*, that will lead on the short term as the next decade for the pound to be worth less than today and on the longer term to earn less.

And UK can't compete with the rising North Africa that's being shadowed by EU development funds as a result of the migration crisis, because why build a [insert manufacture] factory/plant in UK were I can build it in Morocco for a fraction of the cost ?

Because Brexit *could* have a certain impact on major industries that will lead to positions and jobs disappearing or become scarce, so they will have to choose from those that they didn't wanted a few years back. Now comes the question if the british will pull its own bootstraps and go for those jobs at which he looked with a stink eye a few years ago because it was supposedly beneath him and were done by those pesky eastern european ?

Britain has rebuilt itself to many time to count in the past 500 years, but will the today's *entitled* Briton rise up to the challenge ? Or it will pack it all up, show the middle finger on his way to invade Ireland and the rest of EU's West ?

4500,"1. So you believe that the life expectancy of East Germans dropped from 1990 to 1996 and since then it has been gradually rising? You understand how far fetched this sounds right? But in any case here is a [source](https://www.gut-leben-in-deutschland.de/static/LB/indicators/health/life-expectancy/) since 1954.
2. Life expectancy absolutely indicates health in the populace. Nutrition was worse because people were poor. I know you dislike this word but it's the best word to describe when someone doesn't have enough to eat. But let's say that some people were actually happy to die young and escape the Socialist Utopia. Let's look at life [satisfaction](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/11/06/east-germans-now-as-satisfied-with-life-as-west-germans/). Do you notice a trend?
3. Life expectancy for East German men has still haven't caught up. But it will.
4. There is forced and there is forced with lethal force. People would be shot for trying to escape the GDR and describing this as *that easily* is highly misleading on purpose. Yes, violent oppression is a fundamental characteristic of Socialism. Because once implemented Socialism becomes extremely unpopular very quickly and the only way to opress this dissatisfaction is with lethal force. Also in a capitalistic system you can be as socialist as you like. You can open your home and share it with the homeless. You can split your salary with the needy. I wonder how many self described Socialists do this voluntarily.
5. Ah the good old argument every Socialist results to. *The world has never seen Socialism implemented correctly*. *Next time we will get it right*. Yet this ideology exists for 200 years and millions have died because of fanatics trying to implement it. No one has managed to get it right because it is a fundamentally flawed system. The only people you can fool with this argument is the young and the naive. Any useful ideas Socialism brought to the table have long been already absorbed by the democratic part of the political spectrum.
6. I bet especially the party members and their families really miss the GDR. But more seriously looking at the graphs I shared for point 2 gives you the answer. Every system has winners and losers. It is just that Socialism, despite what it claims, results for  an overall worse quality of life for most people.

That sounds like a way to create massive crime ridden ghettos. Also just giving them all citizenship out of pity doesn't work as then they would all be entitled to all the services, which would completely overwhelm all the societal systems, as now the amount of people not paying taxes but still using government services just grew ten fold.

If there is to be any kind of integration, it would have to be really gradual so the society and the economy can handle it, not just letting some few million people in at once.",,/r/europe/comments/eo4tsq/austrias_leader_says_immigration_as_much_a_risk/fee1f3p/,FluffnPuff_Rebirth,1579024388

4659,"You seem to not actually understand -why- us leaving the EU is so bad. I'll put it in simple terms for you. It's not just because we do most our trade with the EU, but because the EU acts as a central body where most our trade agreements are organised through, and the clout being part of such a large international body gives us in those trade agreements. The UK leaving the EU is so bad because there were zero plans put in place as to how we would actually replicate all these deals and agreements and we spent three years faffing about and making no attend to rectify that.

Meanwhile, Scotland is attempting to leave a floundering UK to rejoin the international trade body. Which realistically would be a fairly swift process, as Scotland already aligns with the EU's laws and regulations.

Furthermore, your view on Scotland's budget deficit is based on flawed maths. There is no definitive breakdown of Scotland's economy, as the Treasury refuses to create one, so all we have is the GERS report estimate, which is fine as a baseline, but the problem is it's estimates of Scotland's deficit also includes a few variable aspects.

Firstly, part of that deficit is based on spending by the UK Government on things on behalf of Scotland, mostly notable Trident and the UK military. Whilst of course Scotland will have a military of some sort, it is definitely not going to contain a Blue Water Navy like the UK, or even a military force anywhere near as large with the capabilities to strike across the world. It will most likely act as a Defence force more than anything else, and it goes without saying that Scotland will have zero interest in funding it's only nuclear weapons programme.

Secondly, it is also based on the idea that Scotland would be keeping it's taxation, spending and fiscal policies directly in line with how the UK currently operates their's, which is a fairly bold assumption to make, and it is quite likely adjusts will need to be made.

I'm not under the assumption that Scotland is somehow going to turn into Switzerland or Norway overnight, but the claims that Scotland will somehow become the next Greece of Europe despite being the 3rd richest region in the UK after London and the South-East (2nd richest region if the oil prices remain high) is honestly laughable.

The most likely outcome is that Scotland's economic position is unlikely to change much compared to it's current standard under the UK for the time being. But in exchange the Scottish government have much better power to shape that economic direction, and we have the ability to rejoin the EU, which is by far the most sensible option we could take for our future finances.",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/eojyjg/scottish_independence_uk_government_rejects/fedqoki/,Fairwolf,1579017812

4676,"Litte story/rant from my youth.

For 2 weeks of my schools summer holidays when I was around 10 (so early 90s), I was living with my grandparents at the caravan site they had their camper for around 8 months/year. The other campers were also mainly german seniors who had their own caravans with terrace and everything you need on the site but there were no kids of my own age there. There was a swimming pool though and not far away there was a great big field and a forest where I used to play.

One day, there appeared a colorful wooden wagon on the dirt-track between the forest and the field and I could see a man with short, ravenblack hair sitting bare chested in the sun in front of it, while a woman with extremely long straight, black, beautiful hair was cutting his hair and trimming his mustache. It was a scene like from a disney movie. I had a very sheltered upbringing and was a little naive and trusting, but also cautious because they were so different from people I knew. For example I knew only one family with hair that black and they had a funny name and talked funny too. So I went to them, said Hi and began talking to them. They spoke very, very bad german but where friendly and that only added to the exotic air surrounding them. After a while I sat down on one of their wooden chairs and they began to ask where I was from, and how my holidays had been so far and told me about how they enjoyed the good weather and that they did not have enough money to camp on the same site as my grandparents. And I told them about the family living next door whose son Attila was one of my friends and that they looked a little bit like them.

I don't know how long I sat with them, but Kalo and Suki left a remaining impression on me. They were friendly and hospitable, even handed me some bread when I told them that I should go home soon, because I was growing hungry. But what I remember most vividly is the following: Sometime into our talking, I heard the angry scream of my grandfather who rage-walked over the field towards us. ""Get away from them! Come here!"" He was really pissed off, he called them kidnappers and even when I tried to tell him that I met them and that they were friendly, he told me they were ""Zigeuner"" (german: Gypsies) and would steal me away. He dragged me all the way back to the campsite and lectured me how ""those people"" are evil and steal children and I should never talk to them again.

The next day they were gone and for years after I had conflicting opinions about Roma and Sinti because obviously my grandfather should know better but it always conflicted with my personal experience.

Thinking back now, yes, I can see that everything was way less romantic and they were less clean and their things were cobbled together and that the glorious colorful wagon they had been in was colorful but also small and made for a miserable living. But they still were friendly and I don't remember feeling any menace from them. My grandfather on the other hand had grown up in the Third Reich and his opinions were certainly prejudiced.",République fédérale d'Allemagne,/r/europe/comments/eoidka/the_gypsy_stereotype_affects_us_all_germanys/fedew2q/,Enkrod,1579009616

I would reformulate and say the integration rate is very very small but it still exists. I witnessed it a number of time in high-school and university. 

The best example I saw was when I worked at a big company in Bucharest and I had a team of 6. One of them was a gypsy guy. That was a perfect example of integration. I guess his luck was also the fact that his mother left him and ran in Spain(i think). 

She left him with an aunt in Bucharest. Before, he lived in a gypsy village and I guess if he would have stayed there, his chances of success would have been tiny. He became my right hand man, the person I trusted most in that company and I never cared that he was gypsy.

First, the person is obviously talking about wild mammals that they studied, not sea urchins or jellyfish.

[How Rich Nations Benefit From EU Membership](https://voxeu.org/article/how-rich-nations-benefit-eu-membership)

&gt; A measure of the magnitude of the economic benefits from EU membership  is given by the difference between the actual per capita GDP for each  country (or labour productivity) and that of its SCM artificial control  group. We find substantial benefits for the 1973, and modest benefits  for the 1995 enlargement. For the first ten years post-accession, per  capita incomes for the former would be approximately 12% lower, while  that for the latter would be about 4% lower (without EU membership).  Alternatively, if we consider all years since accession, the respective  figures would be about 34% for the former, and 5% for the latter. We  find that per capita incomes in the UK and Denmark would have been 25%  lower (if they had not joined the EU in 1973), but that the benefits for  Ireland are even larger. Our estimates suggest that per capita income  in Ireland would have been about 50% lower if it had not joined the EU  in 1973. 

[How Poorer Nations Benefit From EU Membership](https://voxeu.org/article/how-poorer-nations-benefit-eu-membership)

&gt; This column presents new estimates of the economic (monetary) benefits  from EU membership. The main finding is that of substantial and positive  pay-offs, with approximately 12% gain in per capita GDP. Despite  substantial differences across countries, there are clear indications  that the benefits of EU membership have significantly outweighed the  costs (except for Greece). An important question is to identify factors  that allow countries to better exploit EU entry. Campos *et al.*  (2014) began investigating this issue and their preliminary findings  highlight the role of financial development (i.e., more financially  developed countries growing significantly faster after EU membership)  and, somewhat less surprisingly, trade openness.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/eodnx4/germany_posts_record_breaking_budget_surplus_of/fedftwt/,leckertuetensuppe,1579010370

&gt;Since when gay couple can have children? And don't get started with adoption which totally whole different thing.

Adoption is one, sure. You also have sperm donors, breeding mothers, or even artificial pregnancy. Gay couples can and do get children.


&gt;Marriage is not a right, but a set of rules governing responsibility of men towards women and vice versa. Because that women will carry Your children, who will be automatically entitled to your property. What equal rights? Marriage itself is not equal, women has to bee pregnant for 9 months.

No, that is your old historical definition of marriage. Marriage in these days is absolutely a right, it's not just about economics and practicality, but also about love and romance. Why deny that right to gay people.

Yeah right, ""lots"". Besides, if they don't want to get married, they don't have to. That's what equal rights are. Everyone gets to choose for themselves what they want.

First as long as people want eggs there will be male chick to dispose of. There are a ""waste product"" of the egg industry, you can't raise them as their flesh is not worth the feed required and you can't prevent reproduction from producing males.

Shredding while gore is a quick and relatively pain free way to die for the chicks (in 1s they go from chicks to meat pulp, not time for the brain to process the pain). Alternative are few and the only other legal one I know of would be asphyxiation which is a bit more expensive and let them suffer longer.

Finally there is an alternative: kill them while in the egg (=abortion of the male embryo). While it saves you the gore it cost more, isn't failproof (so you still have some male chick to dispose of) and you are still culling half the fertilized eggs so depending on your view on abortion (and it would be a very late one) it's morally as bad or not much better than killing them right after birth.

Yes, because you can compare freely the factuality of their news with other news outlets easily thanks to the internet.

The core of the problem is a matter of democratic presentation in the house of representatives that rules you.      
       
Your paragraph about police etc. reads like  the kind of rationalizations the South African state came up with about the Bantustan, who were, just like the West Bank, not really independent countries with for example their own army and full sovereignty over its territory. That would be the two state solution, but apparently that's also a no go for Israel, so I return to my original point about giving them the vote in the Knesset then.           
         
Concerning your argument that the PA budgets money to give to Palestinian prisoners in Israel, I'll grant you that's stupid, but there's two buts. First, if the PA is dissolved and the laws of the land of Israel apply to all the lands it controls, that would immediately solve the problem of the PA coming up with stupid budgetary decisions. Second, Israel punished the PA for that by withholding a portion of the monthly transfers of tax revenues that Israel collects on behalf of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. This example actually illustrates how the West Bank is not an independent country, because tax revenues first flow to Israel and are then redistributed.

5224,"&gt;When I said Europeans were brutal your response was ""but natives were savages who fought between each other all the time""

Ok, let me just walk you through the meaning of that conversation.

A guy says that Europeans brought their superior technology to less developed regions through colonisation.

Another guy says, ""sounds like racism bro"", implying they would be able to somehow catch up technology-wise without any intervention or were actually on equal footing in this departnment.

I asked, ""then how did they conquer so much so easily?"".

Then the fun begins: you chime in and say ""because Europeans were SOOOOOOO BRUTAL, man"". Which in this context implies that the tribes lost because *only because they were less brutal than the conquerors and that held them back*.

Then I state the fact that the tribes *actually* were as brutal as it goes, just like your regular European Joe or Rodriguez, and the real cause of their downfall was inferior technology and military tactics.

&gt;They lost because they were wrong? That's such a weird way at looking at history. So the Europeans won, and that gave them a Justification for slavery and genocide?

While I admittedly do not have knowledge of Lithuanian, inputting the source into Google's translator gave me impression that Soviets were following standard NKVD/MGB policy of deportation. There were three major deportation operations: Vesna, Osen, Priboi. Osen and Priboi are completely standard Soviet policy: deportation of kulaks followed by forced collectivization of farming.

Vesna, however, was stated to be targeted specifically against nationalist movements. They targeted the rebels AND their families, plus (important thing to note is that Soviet ""target selection"" is not to be trusted) their apparent supporters, which also includes kulaks. This operation is heavily resembling post-Civil War Red terror they used to purge remnants of White Movement.

5278,"He's speaking of growth though, installed power generation is what you need to look at when you consider growth of certain type

In annual power generation it is not possible to see the reason for the increase, especially on per month basis. July might have been just uncommonly windy, that doesn't increase the growth of production capabilities for any other time.

Also your links don't differentiate between onshore and offshore wind, so you can't see any kind of growth there (or lack of it)

A better link is this

https://www.energy-charts.de/energy.htm?source=solar-wind&amp;period=annual&amp;year=all

By metrics you prefer, from 2018 to 2019 offshore wind grew from 19 TWh annually to 24 TWh annually. What your metric still lacks though is as I said the ability to see what is the cause of the increase ? 

To explain further 

https://www.energy-charts.de/energy.htm?source=wind-offshore&amp;period=annual&amp;year=all

In 2017 Baltic 1&amp;2 generated 1.43 TWh. In 2018 Baltic 1&amp;2 Generated 1.22 TWh. What happened ? Did installed capacity change ? Probably not. Wind blew less, or the downtime due to maintenance/repairs.  It picked up again in 2019 with 1.38 TWh. Again, capacity didn't change (probably), so what did ? 

This is why annual electricity generation is not really useful for determining the growth of a specific type of energy production. These fluctuations do not cause an increase or decrease in your growth, they're external factors. Installed capacity increase on the other hand...

Which makes him right, compared to onshore wind, the offshore wind development has been severely lacking.

5292,"Yes and no.

Most energy markets in Europe get solved hourly (some countries solve them in even less time, down to 15 mins) so every hour every electricity generator must report to the grid operator how much energy they intend to sell and at which price.

The problem with nuclear comes that it takes more than an hour to start up and ramp up, so nuclear providers generally bid a certain capacity aimed to cover base loads, not peak loads, mitigating risks. 

They don't have the time to ramp up for a peak load, and even if they took the risk, bid for a peak load and ramped up beforehand to be ready to cover the load, there is a chance that the peak load was lower than expected and they would be generating electricity when the grid operator ended up not buying the electricity because they don't need it.

So yes, nuclear can provide power when you need it on paper, but it is not as flexible as a gas turbine for instance, because it takes time for it to change its capacity and the nuclear plant operators will play the market safe and only bid for base loads in order to maximize their profits.

I know your point was more about nuclear energy being dispatchable and wind energy not being, which is completely right. I just wanted to make this point because I have studied the subject and find it fascinating :). Nuclear is a good energy source, but it does has its nuances in electricity markets.",,/r/europe/comments/eo3goy/austrian_green_mep_gas_is_a_better_transition/fec6zkr/,Fraankk,1578967723

5382,"&gt;In fact there's nothing in Christian faith that supports all the anti-gay feeling while there's a clear and direct disapproval of hate itself. These people aren't even following a real religion for their hate.

That may be so but that's not what christians get taught.

[Here's an official Dutch government report from 2012, on the acceptance of homosexuality per religious background.](https://www.scp.nl/dsresource?objectid=f64c54f1-ae6a-4640-b3fe-3ebbf8ee715f&amp;type=org) It's in Dutch so you don't have to try and go read it, but what it basically confirms is that nonreligious people are by far the most accepting, whereas catholics, protestants, evangelicals and muslims are increasingly (in that order) less accepting of homosexuals and equal rights for them.

&gt;Aren't there homophobic atheists as well?

Yes, but at a much lower percentage than among the groups I mentioned above.

Children that are brought up in a religious environment are much more likely to grow up resentful towards homosexuals.

Religious government parties are also the least in favour of equal rights for homosexuals.

You cannot defend religion on this, it is by far the biggest source of hatred towards homosexuals. Not directly perhaps, but through many of its followers.

When you have to rely on calling me a 16 year old boy in order to have an argument that tells me that you are likely just reacting out of self defence instead of a place of knowledge. So let me tell you this: I do not mean to paint all religious people as the bad guy here. In fact the study I linked above says that among catholics, which are the most accepting religious group, about half of all people agree that homosexuals should have equal rights, so there are certainly many good religious people, and considering your post history tells me you are Portuguese I am going to assume you fall into this group.

I am just saying that disapproval of homosexuality stems mostly from religious sources, so it is a good thing to disband it.

5451,"I don't know where /u/smithluke1982 gets his information, but all Amazon links I get as results for searching ""amazon"" are not affiliate links.

If I search ""amazon nintendo switch"", then I get a shopping card (just like Google shows cards for certain searches, most commonly news in my experience) which is clearly marked: ""Ad Amazon"" [[image]](https://i.imgur.com/1nyLbZd.png). These links are affiliate links, as indicated by `tag=duc08-21` in the link. All links not in the ad are not affiliate links.

In this small example, DuckDuckGo also doesn't seem to push Amazon if you're not searching for it. Searching for ""buy nintendo switch"" does not show this Amazon ad, it doesn't even show a link to Amazon's listing on the first page.

**Edit after 6 minutes**: I decided to do another search for ""purchase nintendo switch"", because I realised that my previous search had ""buy"" in it, which could have raised the Best Buy links to the top, because the keyword is in the title of the page and the link. ""purchase nintendo switch"" does show the Amazon ad, with the affiliate tag, but the results of the search still don't show any Amazon links on the first page.

**TL;DR** All Amazon links are plain links, all Amazon ads have affiliate tags in them **End edit**

To all that are commenting ""They have incentive for that link to appear more often"" or ""Now I know they're doing this I'm disappointed in them"", this is so easy to research and disprove.

5489,"Then you are reading different news because the intent is that the independent (from political control) labor court of Denmark will be subject to EU. In other words if a contractor or individual disagrees with the Danish labor court ruling the ruling can be appeled and delayed for years. That is not the tradition here. The procedure here is a dispute is first brought to mitigation directly between employer and union. If that fails then mitigation in labor court with a judge present and representatives from union and employers. If that also fails the labor court proceeds and a final decision is made. This decision is it. It binds all to its law.

This is a fight for survival for both unions and employers in Denmark. They do not want their 120 year old model eroded to useless. For the Danish politicians it is a no brainer. Interfering in the collective agreements is almost a guarantee for losing reelection. 

Young and those with limited skills, low education, handicaps, poor resourcess will not benefit from minimum wages. They will simply not be hired anymore. The low wages negotiated in collective agreements are not the wages Danes get in the private sector. They negotiate wages locally. No one works for the low wage negotiated at collective agreements unless they belong to the groups I mentioned. That is not a ""living wage"". It is instead used to calculate unemployment, sick, maternity, leave, vacation, holiday/Sunday and education benefits (plus more).

So the reality is specific minimum wages will only be used to put a down pressure on wages and it will help no one here. That is the fear unions say exist. That minimum wages will become real wages because EU Court will guarantee employers can get away with only offering it to mainly foreigners and the low resource strong workers in Denmark.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/enpotr/nordic_countries_at_odds_with_eu_over_minimum_wage/featkdu/,Econ_Orc,1578952100

Merkel is an intelligent, (relatively) liberal and dependable leader. She is completely predictable and more interested in stability and rule of law than pushing an agenda and justice.

She has as many conservative detractors as progressives while being not loved, but accepted by the middle. She is the epitome of being unexceptional and non-controversial. That's her whole shtick and how she stayed on top of german politics for so long.

For the French, she has no influence on their national politics (so no reason to hate her there) while being a staunch ally on the european and international stage. This is reflected in her standing in the Netherlands and Sweden (where she does not influence and is even more liked than in Germany) while she has less support in european countries whose politics she **does** influence.

The more extreme the outcome of a decision she has to make, the more she will go with whatever is non-controversial and provides stability and peace. Most people like that about a leader in times of Trump.

This can be compensated by e.g. Geo-thermal and bio mass plants. Also no company could make profits with nuclear without subsidiaries or if they had to pay for long-term storage. Like I said, the energy companies do not want nuclear. Lastly, to go CO2 neutral you have to do much more than switching your power production.

5614,"&gt; Yes, that's the consequence of opening to markets through the ARENH ; not consumer prices.

It also tells us that the low French electricity prices are a lie, a facade being maintained artificially. EDF is more than 37 billion euro in debt! None of what that zombie company does is sustainable.

&gt;Well, since the industry was public it wasn't a problem.

The fact that gigantic research costs are not internalised in the French electricity bills is not altered even one bit because the industry used to be public.

&gt;I would need a source for that.

Look at the Cour des comptes statements on virtually **every single** decomissioning project: All of them way over budget. 

[Report by the French national assembly](http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/documents/notice/14/rap-info/i4428/%28index%29/depots): ""*Experiences with other countries oppose EDF 'optimism' regarding decommissioning costs*""

Germany has created a €38 billion fund to decommission 17 reactors, France only reserves €23 billion to decommission 58! It's clear that *you* and other French taxpayer will fund the difference. Well, you're already funding it by the yearly payments out of the treasury just to keep EDF from going bankrupt.",-6 points 9 minutes ago,/r/europe/comments/eo23ca/new_german_coal_plant_could_threaten_merkels/fea7fi3/,Bojarow,1578945240

5639,"I was slightly interested in the subject and I think there is another aspect of the matter than the arguments described in the article. Poland sees the need to give up coal, but it is a relatively large economy based in 80% on coal energy. The reason for this is climatic conditions. It has as much sun as Alaska, no large rivers on which to build power plants, and the only energy resource stable and big enough to rely energy strategy in country was coal. 

How would the rapid transition to non-carbon sources take place in practice? The estimated cost of such venture is 700-900 billion €. Before rejecting agreement PL govt asked EU comission on financing plan for transition and didn't get assuring answer. Nobody has such money, certainly not Poland. Country will not bite more than it can chew and commits to something which can't be fulfill. Instead, it does what it can - it replaces old coal power plants with other sources with lower or none carbon footprint. The government has not signed this agreement, because for Poland it is unrealistic to give up fossil fuels at all by 2050.  Strategy is going from 87% share of coal energy in total mix in 2010 to 38% share in 2050. Could be better but for me it is still quite good score.

Reviews:

&gt;Absolutely the most thorough book on Chernobyl, with unmatched  research, a sharp sociological vision, and concern with organizational  power. A must.  
&gt;  
&gt;―**Charles Perrow**, Professor Emeritus of Sociology, Yale University  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Sonja  Schmid has written a revealing book based on meticulous research. Her  analysis of Soviet reactor choice before Chernobyl is detailed and  persuasive. Her argument that the Soviet experience has to be  incorporated into our broader understanding of the nuclear industry is  both convincing and important.  
&gt;  
&gt;―**David Holloway**, Raymond A. Spruance Professor of International History, Stanford University; author of *Stalin and the Bomb*

&gt;Offering  a sophisticated reading of previously unexplored sources, Schmid  masterfully steers readers through the political, technical, and  organizational complexities of the Soviet nuclear industry. Her subtle  interpretation of the Chernobyl disaster offers not only a fresh look at  Soviet history, but also a significant rethinking of the roots of any  nuclear disaster. A major achievement.

Granted I did not read the whole thing myself. If you'd like a glimpse though I can strongly recommend: 

[https://srbpodcast.org/2019/10/13/the-soviet-nuclear-industry/](https://srbpodcast.org/2019/10/13/the-soviet-nuclear-industry/) also the one on Semipalatinsk may be interesting for you when it comes to the range of weird reactions people have with regard to nuclear power. 

I think there is much we can agree on here. 

But on a high level it is also extremely risky to make nukes a critical pillar.  In short (and oversimplified) it risks \*turning us\* into a ""Sudan/Boeing mix"" on several levels. 

And looking at waste, proliferation, and human history (over thousands of years) - this is an extremely unsettling proposition. This goes much further than the occasional boom (I think someone calculated one level 6-7 event every 2 months for running 100% nuke powered - not that I think this is what you're proposing), or maybe a few military exchanges. It really is the (near) irreversible damage to the water table that I am really concerned with in the big picture. That could cause serious issues to civilization(s!) as a whole.",,/r/europe/comments/eo3goy/austrian_green_mep_gas_is_a_better_transition/fe9it2l/,devilshitsonbiggestp,1578937860

Now I came with the more prepared causes: Firefox is actually more privacy oriented by default than the normal Firefox. That's a good thing, but what is not is that you can't change about:config settings without root permissions, and you can't install extensions.

Without being able to modify about:config settings you can't disable WebRTC, and you can't change a lot of other settings there that are to improve privacy (you can find a smaller list of these in the Firefox section of [privacytools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/browsers/#about_config)). Firefox Focus deletes cookies and history by default, but it behaves the same otherwise, it does not include these config changes, and it does not have regular settings to allow you to change them. In my opinion it locks you out of customization with the cause to only include privacy protection that would be inconvenient for me (no cookies at all, no history)

Also, you can't install extensions to it.

This was a problem because the protesters, which were mostly people not used to protesting got radicalized, but also the police got disinhibited to dangerous behaviours. Having a less confrontational would certainly have caused some material damage but kept most of the protesters tame. This would have meant less work for the police.

Fair comment, i just don't agree with your second part. Yes they need to be heard, but you also have to respect the democratic process : France would go right into a third rate country if the street could manage anytime they start to show how unhappy they are.

Electricity is just a small part of total energy used by industrial economy.Taking total energy use shows us real problems with transport and industrial energy use.Neither of these is really solvable with current intermittent sources

US has higher emissions per 1000$ of GDP but is also significantly wealthier that drives most of the difference also nations similar to the US like Canada have similarly higher emissions while being significantly poorer.North America uses more energy than Europe primarily on transport even with Canadians taking huge amount of their power from hydro and nuclear they still have to get the remaining energy out of fossile fuels

Us is not less or more reliant on fossile fuels than Germany because outside of electricity that can be decarbonized like in France there are no viable technologies to make transport carbon free and BEV are a good decade off before they could replace freight let alone aviation that can't replace hydrocarbon fuels in any way other than using synthfuel.

Natural Gas is significantly cleaner and more thermally efficient than coal it is also much cheaper and faster to respond unlike conventional boilers gas turbines are wonderful to work with in modern grid.They are great to complement base load generation and intermittent sources and recent popularity of that source is driven by high profitability of small turbine operations that by elastic output can work suppressing price spikes.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/eo23ca/new_german_coal_plant_could_threaten_merkels/fe8u6kf/,Lox-droplet,1578930935

5852,"yes, prediction not recommendation. Still, the IPCC didn't show in their SPM (the only thing that people will actually read, if any) any prediction that both had ""less than +1.5C "" and ""less nuclear"", that should tell us something.    

Just like for climate change, I keep my distance with general public publications meant to explain one way or another. that is not how science work. you have international expert bodies. if you think that climate change is wrong or the radiative forcing calculations should be corrected, convince your peers at the IPCC and then I'll listen. The general public isn't the forum to establish scientific consensus.    

What do you mean by ""fast scaling nukes (like Chernobyl)""? Do you mean RBMK? They sure were cheap and fast, but I wouldn't like to see anymore of them; especially when good old BWR/PWR have proven to be [fast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Sweden#/media/File:Electric_production_in_sweden_1964-2009.PNG) [enough](https://www.connaissancedesenergies.org/sites/default/files/album_images/puissance-parc-nucleaire-france_zoom.png).    
That is exactly my point too. I don't want to see nuclear power plant in Sudan or other unstable region, they should be the ones allowed to use the little natural gas we can tolerate. We, the developed democracies should stop being pretentious and self righeous and act like adults: do the effort that we may not like (use NPPs) so that other can be the priority beneficiaries of renewables and a bit of fossile fuel.     
By closing our NPPs and using the renewable for us, and additionally keeping fosile around, we are not showing a responsible image; we are satifying our own ego and good conscience.      

Remember this: nuclear is a *local, low probability, risk*, look at Fukushima or Chenobyl, we were promised millions of deaths from Chernobyl, we are still waiting. Climate change is a *global, certain, risk*, every g of CO2 in the atmosphere will heat up the entire planet for hundreds of thousands years to come; no accident, no earthquake, no tsunami, just the normal operation and physics of our power plants (among other things).        
Waste? France is drowning under nuclear waste at a rate of ... 2kg/person/year.      
Accident? WHO on [Fukushima](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/78218/1/9789241505130_eng.pdf): ""The present results suggest that the increases in the incidence of human disease attributable to the additional radiation exposure from the Fukushima Daiichi NPP accident are likely to remain **below detectable levels**"" [or](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/94/11/15-168187/en/) ""In contrast with the findings of only marginal internal radiation contamination among children and adults, it appears that the increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases and mental health problems may outweigh the burden of disease caused directly by radiation"" [or](http://www.unscear.org/docs/publications/2013/UNSCEAR_2013_GA-Report.pdf): ""The most important health effect is on mental and social well-being, related to the enormous impact of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident, and the fear and stigm related to the perceived risk of exposure to ionizing radiation.""        

Now look again at [CO2/kWh](https://co2scorecard.org/countrydata/trendchart) of various countries and the expected consequences of climate change; do you think they are ""likely to remain below detectable levels""? Which waste and which ""accident/normal operation"" do you think our kids will be the most worried about?",,/r/europe/comments/eo3goy/austrian_green_mep_gas_is_a_better_transition/fe8v5uj/,233C,1578931313

5858,"The average output of a wind turbine is somewhere around 30-50% of the nominal (e.g. 3MW) capacity (location dependent). They also last only half of the time a nuclear plant lasts, and that's a generous estimate.

Nuclear plants commonly produce a bit under 90% of their nominal capacity. Some suck, some run over 90%. This also almost always happens according to plan during e.g. summer holidays. With wind and solar you rely on weather.

So you need about 5 times more nominal wind power to replace one nuclear plant. For 1000MW it is 5000MW. If you could use all the excess heat from nuclear plants that would be much worse.

In addition you need energy storages, such as hydro reservoirs with pumps, an intelligent power grid to balance between varying weather conditions, and backup plants because it would suck if there was a windless and cold winter month. You also need more SF6.

The funny thing is that despite all of this the wind energy can (will?) be cheaper. However, some areas are much better for wind and solar than others.",,/r/europe/comments/eo3goy/austrian_green_mep_gas_is_a_better_transition/fe8vbnj/,m_hakkinen,1578931405

5923,"&gt; Nuclear is way better alternative, by not only being cheaper but also generating less CO2 per MWh.

Nuclear power plants are far more expensive to built, the up-front cost is a lot higher than for a gas power plant. It also takes longer, is much more expensive to insure and Nuclear power is also less flexible compared with gas. Gas can serve as a complimentary power source to renewable energy. While its not perfect, its CO2 output is far lower than coal &amp; its is also a lot less dirty.


&gt; Still, we (worldwide) should focus on limiting CO2 emmision in China and India, as EU as a whole generates only ~11% of man-made CO2.

Have you ever pondered that it would be great if we serve as an example? Someone has to do the first step and we have both the technology and resources to do it.

And as another user pointed out, our CO2 output is far higher than it should be, only a very small portion of the world population lives in Europe.
