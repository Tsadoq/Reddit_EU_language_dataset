60,"Mmm, no. No. I have every idea of what I'm talking about. That's why I'm currently pursuing my Master's Degree in European and Nordic History, and why I intend to go for my PhD soon after, although I've yet to decide exactly what I'd like to focus that on. 

I'll be very frank with you: I probably know a hell of a lot more about history than you do, even that of your own second-world homeland. All of what you wrote to me was none other than a waste of your own time. I'm sure you probably gave yourself a nice pat on the back for feeling like you really taught me a lesson, but, unfortunately, you've taught me nothing. Well, maybe that Poles are arrogant as hell. But I think I already knew that.

In case you haven't noticed by now, as was clearly demonstrated in conversation between /u/theturnipknight and I, he expressed that Poland is western in Poland's eyes. I clearly said that Poland may consider itself Western European, sure, but is widely not considered at all to be that by numerous other countries. I can think of a handful of Germans I know, for example, and Russians on the the other side whom I know, who would both completely agree with me on this. You are Eastern European. Culturally, historically, linguistically, and modernly. As /u/theturnipknight said, many Poles of the modern era don't like being cast this way. Judging by your prior comment to me, you're undoubtedly one of them.

I must ask, sincerely here: what kind of idiot doesn't think Slavism has anything to do with Eastern Europe? Is this some kind of retarded joke? Honestly! Ain't no Slavs in Western Europe pal. They're exclusively Eastern European, save for immigrants, obviously. 

You know, Italy also has a west coast, an east coast, a north and south. Doesn't make the people not from Italy, and ergo, not Italian. They're still all fuckin' Italians pal. 

And no. Again, in your wishful eyes, but not in reality, nor accepted as such globally. I've met Czech people before who try and say the same thing; that they're Western and not Eastern. Tell me then -- why does almost everyone collectively view them as Eastern? Could it be that they wish to be disassociated with the rest of Eastern Europe and hoping to shake their label? I wonder...

And yeah, yeah. No shit. Everybody knows Poland is Catholic. Big whoop. I guess the historically Lutheran Baltic countries (save for Lithuania which is also mostly Catholic -- or was, historically) must be Western too by your logic! 

Poland is central European... Geographically. Period. It is absolutely not more western than it is eastern. If Poland were more eastern than it is western, than we wouldn't be having this discussion, because everybody outside of Poland would immediately and unquestioningly think of it as Western European. But news flash! Repeating myself: nobody outside of the geograpgical area that constitutes Central Europe thinks of the countries in a way that is anything but western and eastern. 

Stop talking to me in a way that assumes I have no idea what I'm taling about. You have zero idea about who I am, my academic credentials, my study interests, where I have travelled, lived, and who I have met. You're an incredibly arrogant son of a bitch. Unless you've got a PhD of some sort, I doubt with great extremity that you know anything more than I do regarding the history, culture, genetics, or anthropology of Europe.

210,"I will definitely agree that there are countries that benefit more from freedom of movement than others, but is worth noting that the countries which I would argue lose out of the deal are also the most supportive of the concept of it.

So while I would agree that they lose and I seriously question the sustainability of some societies with high emigration (like Poland), it is not clear to me that that would lead to an united states of Europe by itself.

248,"&gt; I have clarified many times ethnic cleansing or genocide was bound to take place. And it proved my point by ethnic cleansing taking place.

I also clarified several time that genocide is the main issue I point out and not ethnic cleansing, I gave an example that if Armenians could choose between the two, it would be ethnic cleansing without batting an eye. There is a massive difference between the two. You put them together as if they are both equally disastrous for a nation, and that is absolutely not the case.

&gt; Standard practice of the Ottoman Empire was manipulation, charming.

Starting even a bit before the Armenian Question the Ottoman Empire started using various means to contain the issue - the highlight from the Armenian Question was always the rights of the minority Christians and their self determination (as was understood then) - this is what made the rulers seeking to minimise the representation of Armenians in any way they can, when ended up in massacres in 1895 and eventual genocide later. Fuat Dundar's work touches on some aspects of this. The Armenian representatives (the Church) also played with numbers. The understanding of the Armenian Genocide requires stretching the timeline to at least the start of the Armenian Question.

&gt; the majority of the Muslim population even if subdivided into different groups, therefor Armenians were a minority in this sense.

They would not be the minority group though anymore. Again never mind gerrymandered borders. Really this discussion is based on minority/majority which by definition depends on where you draw the borders, which we already touched on and the discussion of viability of states came about which I argued that Armenians have always used the mountains as their defence lest an empire-level force comes laser focused to destroy any remnant of Armenia which is what happened. That is an unnatural event with regards to viability of states. Let's recall that it was an attack against civilians - having been a state, rules of war existed at the time against such an act from an external state. But such rules didn't exist against groups within states (hence why genocide was devised to amend this legal void).

&gt; If there was no conflict why were 200,000 Azeris expelled from Armenia proper (and not the NKR, those are a different 400,000. This really does show your race complex, Armenia has no nation building process? Are you high? This is moon landing deniers level of stupid.

You have a very limited and preconceived understanding of this conflict which has nothing to do with its reality. If you are interested get a book such as the Black Garden which even though attempts to build a forced balanced narrative, and thus it is not objectively neutral, it is still the best book out there with real information and not filled with propaganda and rhetorics. I will just say that the conflict wasn't sparked between the people themselves on hate or what not. As much as this may not make much sense to you here it goes: Ethnic hatred didn't cause the conflict, the conflict caused ethnic hatred. Furthermore the ethnic cleansings *for the most part* were ordered and humane (as much as you can call ethnic cleansing humane, but bear with me), even leaders of small towns and villages agreed to swap their towns/villages. Again out of so many hundreds of thousands of Azeris only 1000 were killed.

And no, Armenia has no *nation building process* as in national identity. Why is this so hard for you to grasp? Armenians are a very old nation, their identity is strong, there is no need to build on top of it. Another issue is nationalism and what not, but that is not nation building in this context. 

&gt; Holy shit, plenty of very legitimate Armenian genocide scholars have said something, including people like Ronald Grigor Suny, a berlin prize winner. Also, are you denying the Circassian genocide now? 

Again, not the way Turkey's official narratives are doing. And no where did I deny the Circassian genocide? Because I said Turkey is using it politically to build narratives of justifications of the Armenian Genocide? One thing leads to the other how exactly?

&gt; Go read the work of people like Grigor Suny, or is the grandson of genocide victims not good evidence for you?

&gt; The muhacirs were the motivation, the fact that they existed is why they felt the need to nationalize.

You are changing the goalpost all the time with this, now you are saying they were the ""motivation"". I did say they played a role of course so did the Balkans, but they were not the cause of the Armenian Genocide - you started this specific debate on the premise that it the muhacirs came down with rage and caused the Armenian Genocide portraying as if it were ethnic strife which caused it - that simply is not true. The genocide was conspired, planned, implemented and executed by CUP. And other elements were yes, motivators, useful elements, irregular actors, opportunist tribes, etc... but they didn't *cause* the Armenian Genocide. You are taking responsibility from the real responsible people here.

&gt; The CuP never would have come to power if it wasnt for the Balkan tragedy. 

Yes of course, but not the way you are portraying it here - as in one tragedy caused a genocide. Just because they came to power via a coup and saw the empire being eaten away in their eyes and saw the Armenians as the possible next nation wanting to do the same doesn't mean that they are not responsible for what the did and the Balkan tragedy was the cause. That is mental gymnastics to absolve those responsible by portraying them as some sort of victims. It's like hey, if WWI wasn't so bad against the Germans then the Holocaust would never have happened- without the results of WWI Hilter would never come to power after all! Really?

&gt; The Circassians and Balkan Muslims were victims. The CuP were perpetrators. The Circassian and Balkan muslims were disproportionately represented in the CuP. It is very simple, plenty of good scholarship on the subject.

Right, but that is a far cry from what you were portraying before, as a sort of ethnic conflict. You also changed your arguments from ""rage"" to ""rational and calculated"". This whole discussion started with the premise that the Armenians would carry out a genocide based on ethnic ""rage"" and whatnot and you used the Balkans as example, and yet it turns out at the end that indeed that isn't how it all played out. You can have genocides based on ethnic hatred where two or more ethnicities have a go at destroying each other, or you can have a state implement a genocide which is the case of the Armenian Genocide. Yet you blur the distinction between these two things to show how ""genocide is inevitable"" - it is not. Even if the CUP had been exclusively made up of muhacirs or Circassians still doesn't mean that the Armenian Genocide was inevitable. It was. What changes all this is not their ""hatred"" or ""rage"" from the Balkans, but their psyhopatic cold blooded calculation on their concern of a shrinking habitat from what they were used as an empire and the need for lebensraum in addition to a system which will change the dying empire into something else more modern *based on their experience in the Balkans* from a statist point of view. One narrative paints them as victims, the other doesn't. They were perpetrators as you said. There is also the often overlooked German participation in all of this where still only the tip of the iceberg is known.

Again, the Holocaust was not caused because of WWI. Apply the same understanding.

I completly agree that you can't be a choosing beggar and if you have to do a shitty Job to get money, you just have to push through. Our/my experience has been that most people don't even answer to your application. He didn't just apply to Jobs in his field but also to Jobs at McDonalds/cleaning in Businesses. The amount of answers was basically nothing.

The difference was that in England he actually could walk to whatever place he needed to be, here you are very dependent on car/bus. You mostly pay to wake up to a good view, not for location. Location wise his was definitely better. Also i think it is comparable. He was living in a bigger City than we live in now, with better location, just a lot less view.

From Salzburg to Vienna? Must be very desperate to spend 6-8 hours in a train for an 8 hour Job. I agree that when its the only Option it might be doable, but ... in reality its just dumb. Austria isn't that big, yes, but full of mountains. Its 2h+ to go from Bregenz to Innsbruck. And that is from one Train Station to another. If the Job/Home isn't right there, you are quickly looking at 6-8h a day just to get there and get back. The travel cost would be HUGE too. (Probably more than you would earn). If you can you should move to where you have the best chances, but many people move to their relatives or to people they know and then often there is no way that all people can just pack up and move.

280,"I am not assuming much; you are spouting nationalistic gibberish. If you know it or not is pretty secondary because that's still what it is. 

First of all you have an extremely anachronistic idea of how culture and language spread. It's very rarely similar to what happened in the Americas, where disease really did kill off most of the indigenous population, and they really were replaced with a surplus population from Europe that came over and replace them.

Most of the time though you're talking about at most a comingling of the population, and much more often, a relatively small population with a ruling elite who impose their religious and linguistic customs, to a certain extent, on a dominated people. Like the Normans did not actually replace the Saxons, who did not replace the Britons; mainly you're talking about the same people with small waves of migrants at the top, and the English are, genetically, exactly as ""Celtic"" as the Irish and Scottish and Welsh (with Celticness itself also being an idea that's mostly a modern day political invention not really well supported by the record, at least not in the sense that it's meant.)

You simply assert that the Macedonians were Greek without acknowledging the holes in this claim that I pointed out, so once again just clinging to nationalist myth building as a replacement for rigorous and academic historical analysis. It is less the case that you are simplifying, and more the case that you are relying on jingoistic lies that are simple because they are jingoistic propaganda.

&gt; The 12 gods of ancient Greece 

Okay so I need you to consider that if we're talking about Greek or ancient religion generally, you're going to have to rely on a little more than a book you read in the third grade and/or Kevin Sorbo or something. Percy Jackson is not a reliable guide to the complex and varying world of Greek religious practices.

&gt; So I don't know why it seems so odd to you that they do appear different throughout time and other cultures.

No, genius, not other cultures, other times and places *within the Greek speaking world,* and indeed even within the clear cultural core of Greece. 

Greek paganism was not a textual religion. There was no central canon. The idea of how many gods there were for what, or their nature, or the correct forms of worship and sacrifice around them, varied enormously. There is no central and ""core"" ancient Greek religion. The closest thing you can get to that is not so much in their beliefs about the gods but the cult and practices around very important shrines and holidays and the rites associated with them, e.g., the Olympics, the Oracle at Delphi, etc.. And it's pretty ironic that you think this unified them when conflicts over that what were what led to the subjugation of Greece by Phillip during the Third and Fourth Sacred Wars.

&gt; Social structure was more to the alliances they had between them when they were not in war. Yeah I know they fought alot.

So when you said that they were bound together by social structures, what you meant was that they didn't fight each other, except when they did, which was a lot.

&gt; Yes indeed during the Roman empire and the Byzantium Athens and Thessaloniki were not anything special. To be honest they never were. Athens was the most prominent city during the classical times but it was never the capital. It was actually not even the first capital of modern Greece. Nauplio was. During the Byzantium it was Costantinople. So? It doesn't mean that the mainland did not flourish.

Athens was the most prominent city in Balkan Greece maybe. Not more than that.

And sure there were times when Balkan Greece may have enjoyed relative peace and prosperity, when there was strong imperial rule. Under the Romans, or under the Ottomans, although you don't want to acknowledge that latter one of course. What does that matter though? It had prosperity relative to its own past. It was never a regional, much less a global hub. 

&gt; I don't claim that nothing changed. I claim that they evolved as it is natural to happen after 4000 years of living in the very busy Mediterranean. They fought between them over and over again. Unified when in danger. They did conquer each other, talk dirty about each other.

They also fought and unified with other people who are not part of modern day Greece.

You are trying to retrofit your modern-day political agenda onto the past. This is in the service of nationalistic and jingoistic propaganda. 

&gt; But that doesn't stop the fact that many of the cities you talked about where Greek and so was considered the Byzantium.

Nope. Alexandria was not ethnically Greek, nor Byzantium, nor Antioch. Syracuse and Pergamon may have been at the founding but did not stay so. 

The plain fact is that ancient peoples were less interested in ideas of nationalistic and racial purity than their modern claimed descendants would like to believe in their ideology. Places that were successful attracted people from all over, and became hotbeds of intermingling. There were cultural standards- dialects of Greek were indeed vital to acquiring high social position in most of the Eastern Mediterranean from the time of Alexander to the time of the Ottomans, nearly two thousand years later. 

But you can't actually, with any fidelity to the truth, tie credit for everything anyone speaking Greek dialects did in that time period across a wide range of places, from a wide range of geographic and ethnic origins, all back to the modern day country of Greece, no matter how hard their embassies try to pretend otherwise.

287,"&gt; Imagine if Brits claimed to be descendants of Trojans and early republican Roman

Okay, let's do this. My Scots ancestors were Border Reivers until the early 1600s. They occupied the area close to Hadrians Wall which, 1400 years before was manned by North African Legionaries under the command of the Roman Emperor Septimus Severus; also 'African', born in what is now present day Libya. Those legionaries undoubtedly would have produced offspring among the local population. After 1400 years/50 generations or so they would count among the ancestors of just about everyone in the region. 

Those North African Legionaries in turn would have had ancestors that travelled and traded all along the mediterranean coast throughout the three millennia B.C. and in that time Troy, on the coast of Turkey was founded and also the Pyramids of Egypt were built.  2500 years equals a LOT of generations and therefore a lot of common ancestors. Undoubtedly our Legionaire invaders would've shared distant ancestors who not only founded Troy but also built the Pyramids. 

My own DNA Haplogroup J-M172 is found at highest frequencies in the northern Middle East, west of the Zagros Mountains in Iran, to the Mediterranean Sea. Also this 'British' DNA of mine shares 50% in common with you, Kandierter, in Germany+France. No surprise here really. Everyone should learn about their own DNA.

393,"&gt;  Studies of graves in cemeteries from the 400AD to 650AD show that Britons, on average, lived for around two years longer following the fall of the Roman Empire.

&gt; Robin Fleming, professor of history from Boston College in the US, said that once Britons were no longer forced to pay taxes they were able to eat more nutritious food which increased longevity.

&gt; Asked if the fall of the Roman Empire was good for Britain, Prof Fleming added: “If you are a villa owner, no. But it you are part of the 97 per cent of the rest, then, yes, it might add a couple of years to your life which makes a difference.

411,"&gt;They were, but they were allowed to return, 100 000 Serbs were not allowed to return, they either ended up in North, or in Serbia (mostly this one), both Roma and other non-Albanians were expulsed as well.

Roma got kicked for other reasons primarily their role in the war. Many roma plundered and robbed the homes of displaced Albanians (  serbian homes too ) and were assisting serbian troops. Im not aware of other minorities being kicked, turks and bosniaks still live in West Kosovo ( Prizren etc.). As for the Serbian population a big majority of them have moved away for financial reasons. If you go to Mitrovica they will tell you most Serbs who owned land or property in South M. sold it and with the money moved to Belgrade. South-East Kosovo also is majority Serbian many of whom returned after the war. The country is suffering from one of the most severe migrations in Europe 2nd only to Ukraine. It is safe to assume most of the serbians who did not return did so by choice. Belgrade &gt; N. Mitrovica in every way.

The arrest seems reasonable in context, and given he has been warned before and indeed had a suspended sentence handed down before for what amounts to the same issue.  Essentially he breached the conditions that allowed his sentence to be suspended... What did he expect? Would you expect any different for anyone else?

&gt;and the media blackout.

The media 'blackout' is until the end of the trial that was threatened by his actions. Or to put it another way, to report this properly, you'd end up repeating the 'reporting' that the judge felt could compromise the trial. 

I really don't understand why people are so incredibly keen to create the conditions for a trial that they clearly think is important, could fall apart. None of this is going to help bring justice, it has the potential to do exactly the opposite, and derail the trial.

Then if as little as one fifth of the members of one House demands it, the amendment must be voted in a referendum. This means that even small opposition groups could request it. To avoid the referendum the amendment must be approved by a two-thirds supermajority in each House during the second round of voting. The whole procedure could take far more than one year.

Besides, countries economically weaker countries profit from disproportionately cheap interest rates.

I also wonder how true this is: 

&gt; How do you deal with the issue of needing an interest rate hike in one member state when another could use an interest rate decrease? 

Many countries have unequally wealthy regions. And even after transfer unions, there is still a lot of financial inequality (and often times it even is *rising* inequality). Somehow it's fine if they all have the same currency though. Shouldn't every state within a country, every city within a state have their own currency if we follow that logic to the end? Then they all could make optimal currency decisions and they all would be richer, right?

For example, Hamburg has a GDP per capita of 63000€. McPom has a GDP per capita of 26000€. They use the same currency. How is that not a ""flawed"" system?

Again, ethnic cleansing however horrible it is, is not the same as genocide. Nor massacres is the same as a genocide. Obviously I am not condoning any of this, but we are doing what if scenarios basing on calamity of the civilian population. These atrocities are qualifiable as to the effects they have on the targeted groups as groups - obviously on an individual level, every death is the same no matter the ethnicity or religion. But we are talking about nations here. For example Kurdish tribes having been expelled even with some massacres, however horrible, doesn't equate the genocide that Armenia went through which destroyed a nation. More so when it was a systematically planned effort from the top to cleanse the region of traces of Armenians because of the ties this group had to its historic homeland - There were Kurdish tribes (again, there were different tribes and peoples, lumping them all in one is not correct, but for sake of argument) which were largely nomadic until around the time frames we are examining now. I am not even including in this equation the notion that Armenia was under an empire, not a nation-state - there was no homogeneity as is understood today (and to stretch this, even today in Turkey this is an issue). An Empire collapsing always has such consequences, but the conquered nations paying the ultimate price of being destroyed is rather extreme.

Sure, but also note how the GFA establishes a North South Ministerial Council which is responsible for certain issues that concern the entire island. If the Uk then takes those responsibilities out of the councils hand to implement their own policies, it is breaking the GFA.

But it also remains that the Common Travel Area could no longer include Ireland if the UK choose to exit the common market. It can choose not to close the border, but that effectively enables the free movement of goods and people. At which point to protect the main island, there would have to be checks between Northern Ireland and it, which would go against the unity of the UK.

So yes a border between NI and Ireland is a huge hit when it comes to multiple agreements between Ireland and the UK. 

Also, the GFA is not just a red herring. That even the people who are working on Brexit have to consider it means that there are issues to be solved. If it was no big issue, whenever the EU brought the topic up the UK could simply reply that it's not at all an issue.

670,"&gt; Again, as a counter example to what you are saying, look at that same map, Karabakh is a minority in Azerbaijan. yet they existed as a de jure entity until 1991 (and now as de facto, but that is another discussion).

This is 1918, not 2018. Borders being oddly shaped only really work with an Empire keeping the two together, such as Nakhichevan and Karabakh. If there was a strait up war, then either Azerbaijan would control all of it, Armenia would control all of it and ethnically cleanse the area, or it would be split. But there wouldn't in a million years be this weird partition. 

&gt; Even look at Armenia. If the battle of Sardarabad was lost and assuming Armenians weren't all killed (big assumption), they would have been a minority in an ""Anatolia"" extending all the way to the Caspian sea and thus - no rights of self determination whatsoever because ""minority!"".

I am speaking pre genocide. I was always speaking pre genocide. The point is the Armenian state as you imagine it simply wasnt viable. 

&gt; Another thing is whether any such a state would be viable in the future - that is another discussion though. There are cases of minority groups holding a state together or states which look weird drawn on political map yet make sense on a topological map - current state of Armenia and Karabakh are good examples actually

The Karabakh Armenia situation required the ethnic cleansing of 400,000 Azerbaijanis and Kurds to create a viable, safe area for the Armenian in Karabakh (Greater than the population of Karabakh mind you) and Armenia demands the area is demilitarized if it is ever to be handed back over. This literally proves my point. 

&gt; Also there was no need for nationalisation projects and there has been no such campaigns in the history of Armenia in 20th century. Armenians are an old group, their nationalisation project is a few thousand years old.

[No need for nationalization projects.... right.....](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Comparison_table_of_armenian_azeri_kurdish_population_of_armenia.jpg/1280px-Comparison_table_of_armenian_azeri_kurdish_population_of_armenia.jpg) 

&gt; Sure, it could have turned out bad and many Muslims expelled like in the Balkans, I don't reject this possibility. But however horrible that could be, it still is not a genocide.

It is just literally what Turkey intended to do with the genocide. clearly a huge fucking difference. Look dude, different techniques, same fucking goal. Also what happened during the Balkan Wars was genocide, fyi. The differnece is, the Turks had lines to flee towards rather than being forces into the desert, so they avoided the 70% death rate and cut that down to maybe 40%. 

&gt; As horrible as that population exchange was, it beats a genocide. 

It is still an act that deserves to get you locked up for the rest of your life under international law. 

&gt;  At the end of the day this is a problem of either drawing borders around ethnic boundaries or employing an inclusive ideology and not that of ultra nationalism. 

Ok, and Armenians are just as susceptible to ultra nationalism as well. That has been my entire point. 

&gt; In a reverse scenario had there been no Armenian genocide and things worked out one way or another (original Young Turk movement) and say had Armenians given autonomy and proper rights, then maybe things could have worked out and been different as well.

I am not doubting that. But your idea that somehow the Turks are more likely to commit genocide than the Armenians actually is a bigotry of low expectations. 

&gt; Which time and where? There were several Armenian political entities and different ideologies until 1913 and even after this date, still a few thought they could work with CUP which was a mistake of course. Each entity had at different times suggested different things, including independence as well as working within the Ottoman Empire. Armenia was a nation in the Ottoman Empire, when they were given autonomy to have political parties, they had a range of them - more so than Kurds have today in Turkey in fact. Even though some faction were stronger than others, it makes little sense to brush a whole nation with one brush ideologically.

The  Dashnaktsutyun in 1912, the Hunchakian party always rejected working within the system. Those were the two major Armenian parties at the time. 

I simply stated the leaders rejected after 1912 because those were the only two parties left. 

&gt; You are just employing bigotry of low expectations

Bigotry of low expectations requires a double standard. I am saying every nation state would do this in a similar situation. That is not bigotry, that is a point of view. You can disagree with it, but dont be tossing around word that dont make sense. 

&gt; not to mention bringing in racial issues into this discussion out of the blue

Youre the one who seems to think Armenians can do nothing wrong. That is a racial superiority complex, or at least actual bigotry of low expectations because the Turks cant seem to do so while the Armenians can.

&gt; I don't even subscribe to the idea that the different Muslim groups including Turks at the time were of a specific ideology or had specific features or what not.

I never said that either, I just stated that a Muslim 99% of the time would have rather lived in a Muslim state than a christian state if given the choice who would be their government. 

&gt; The Armenian genocide was not committed by the average Muslim or average Turk on the streets. It was planned and executed at the very top. It was a conspiracy, and many of the Armenians who survived was thanks to Muslims and Turks, some of whom paid the ultimate price in helping Armenians.

Well, thats a non sequitur. 

&gt; So please keep racism out of this. 

I cant if you keep up with your Armenian superiority complex. 

&gt; What was special about some groups of Armenians at the time was that they were a middle man minority which has nothing to do with race and just like Jews wanted freedoms which didn't possess 

Them being a middle man minority was more of a coincidence than anything. The genocide happened because they thought that the Armenians threatened the territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire. if this was anti middle man minority, then Jews would have been killed as well. After the war, during the Republican period, then anti middle man minority hate started to build up, but those are different periods. 

&gt; and hence gravitated at the time towards socialist ideologies and saw value in it.


The Armenians in the cities did this, but the vast majority of them were rural and were not drawn to socialism. 

&gt; t. This doesn't mean in a what if scenario Muslims wouldnt be expelled or what not, but it also suggest another scenario could have played out. 

Yes, because socialists never do demographic engineering. The Stalinists didnt do the Holodomor, deportation of Crimean Tatars, slaughter of North Caucasian Muslims, and more. 


&gt; Again, this is whatif territory - but outright going ""genocide!"" is intellectual dishonesty.

Saying that what if Hitler had never been born there would be no anti Jewish bigotry is intellectually dishonest. Suggesting that during nationalization projects minorities are not killed off is intellectually dishonest. Suggesting that the Armenians didnt have to build a nation is intellectually dishonest. Saying that the Armenians likely would have followed a similar pattern to every other nation is not intellectually dishonest, its a reasonable point of view. You talk about how since they were socialists the Armenians never would have done anything. Guess what happened in Israel, a state that the soviets were literally hoping was going to go red.

677,"It all depends on the contract they signed. If US Navy said ""we want to buy a railgun"" and some company developed one and sold it to them, then obviously they can sell it just as well to anyone else. It's done with most weapons! How else would multiple armies use the same Fighter Planes, or use the same machine guns? o_O Someone designed them and now is selling them. Of course in many cases the development was subsidised by the government, and thus this government ""owns"" at least part of the rights for the design. In such case of course they can vote against selling those weapons to someone. Also some countries (aka US) have legislation which requires the vendors to get permission to sell weapons outside.

If the contract was to develop and sell all the intellectual rights, then of course the company is contractually bound not to re-sell the technology and most likely to transfer/destroy all the data they have on the project.

But IN NO CASE does ANY of this work belong to the government of the country where this work was done. It's all between the buyer and the seller. Even with US ITAR regulation, there is nothing about the government owning the work. They can only prevent it being sold outside.

In case of this topic the buyer is EU and seller are certain companies, some of which located in the UK.

684,"&gt; Just like it would be unjust in the eyes of your kid for you to not pay a single dime for your fucking kid. Thats the point.

Men should be able to decide if they want to have a fucking kid, that's the point. Fatherhood should be voluntary. There are too many children raised without fathers, if there weren't incentives for hostile parenthood (like forced subsidies on the unwilling) I'd expect fewer single mothers to decide to have the children of men who don't want kids.

You think for some reason enslaving sentient people is a desirable outcome. Instead, we should encourage people to intentionally procreate (both parents opt in) or prevent pregnancy (by birth control or abortion.) That way every child that *is* born has the most attention, supervision, guidance and resources devoted to it as possible. Whether you're aware of it or not, you for advocate single motherhood and absentee resentful fathers.

&gt; NIGGA. YOU MADE THE BABY. YOU STUCK YOUR DICK INSIDE AND YOUR FUCKING SPERM MADE A BABY. HOW THE FUCK DO YOU JUST IGNORE THAT? WHY WOULD I SUBSIDIZE YOUR FUCKING KID BECAUSE YOU ARE TO PATHETIC TO PAY FOR YOUR MISTAKES?

Funny how men have to pay for their reproductive ""mistakes"" but women don't. If women don't want the kid, they don't have the kid. If men don't want the kid, it's ""PATHETIC"" and the man's responsibility to pay for something they were forced into.

697,"&gt; 1\. People that want to hurt others will find a sharp knife

Of course, you can do it, or sharpen a blunt knife, or make a DIY knife. But in many cases no knife in immediate availability is just as good as no knife at all. If someone got drunk and started to fight with his drinking buddy, he would not go search for a sharp knife somewhere far away. This argument is similar to ""no point to stop people commiting suicide, determined person will kill himself anyway"". But not all people are that determined, it's not black and white only. Restricting simple, easily available means to kill someone can be effective. 

&gt; 2\. You can seriously stab people with a blunt knife

What the eurozone does for Greece is that they buy their sovereign debt for discounted prices. The market thinks that Greece might default, when that thought is common the interest rate on debt goes up. Increase the interest rate makes it more costly to repay the debt and so the circle goes until something gives. But instead the EU buys Greece's debt and they ask for the low interest rate that can be repaid.

I also agree that a real common eurozone policy would be a great thing. The only condition I have is that we get there with a clear democratic mandate.

&gt; At this point, the best option would have been to just let things run their course.

Depending on what the course is, that could be irresponsible.  Leaving the Euro would bring financial ruin to Italy.  If there is reasonable suspicion this could happen, it would have a significant impact on the economy.  The spread is rising on the background of QE - what happens in the autumn when QE is wound down?  Rising interest rates will inevitably force more austerity as Italy is increasingly priced out of bond markets.  Italy's credit rating is already under review, at a couple of points above junk rating.

&gt; starting what is possibly the worst political crisis in decades

The worst political crisis since WW2 has already started - they're right in the thick of it already.

&gt; another Monti-type guy to form the next government

It's a caretaker government to deal with immediate crisis.  Also, it's easy to blame Monti, but the problems precede him.  Monti's actions are the result of successive failures since the Lira crisis in the 90s to revive Italy's economy.  People should be angry at the people who caused the problems, not the guy who tried to fix them.  Of course, they then go an vote for people offering unicorns.

What is fascinating, to me, is the way some follow them blindly (?). It's basically your populist liberal party that has appeared in every EU country the last decade, but somehow the people that vote them over here don't realise that —they legit believe they're different.

833,"Fair enough about the definition of populism. I probably simplified too much too 'knowingly promising bullshit'.

&gt; Them not minding it is their right. Them not being able to do anything about it even if they wanted to is what makes it authoritarian. If people want to live in such societies (which I'll freely admit tend to be pretty cool for a specific privileged class at the expense of everyone else) then that's a different story - but such a country will never be democratic or offer any individual the freedom we have in the EU for example.

The things is though that it doesn't always have to be only cool for a specific privileged class. China has been successfully shutting the mouths of its people be dragging tens of millions of people out of poverty, creating a new middle class and upper middle class. Of course they combined it with repressive methods, but not only those. People who got significantly richer in the past few decades in China will not want to fight for freedom and democracy.

And I think people in the prosperous Western/Northern European countries need to wake up and realize that the success of democracy in your countries is also very deeply connected with the economic prosperity that you are experiencing and the with relative security that your people are feeling.

Right, because having the most powerful Navy and one of the most powerful air-forces in the world had nothing to do with it...

It's funny though, because your country was *supposed* to have the most powerful army in the world in 1940, yet look how easily you got steamrolled.

Furthermore, I know about the matter as much as you do, unless you work within the Quirinale or have special connection with relevant agents in this case.

&gt; Mattarella made an unprecedented decision that violates the express will of the Italian voters

I disagree on the factuality of this statement. The mechanism of electing a government in Italy is not as simple as you make it. He acted within the power he has under the constitution and his role is a product of the democratic process, so I am not sure how his actions are anti-democratic. He stated, and the parties agreed, that there was great collaboration in forming the government between them and the PdR. 


&gt;But nobody was leaving the euro, you're just making that up (or, more likely, you were told that was the case and, as it confirmed your biases, you believed it)

Savona stated clearly that threatening to leave the Euro should be the way forward for Italy to obtain what it wants from the EU in his book Casa Italia, and in many other instances. I never said somebody *would* leave the euro but that *threatening* to leave the euro was not discussed during elections. 

I am not going to reply to the similarities you pose because they seem self-evidently not relevant, but that's my opinion and you are allowed to think whatever you prefer.


&gt;No idea where this nonsense came from. Savona is a former minister and has held other high-level positions, including related to the EU. And one can easily find articles from just yesterday still saying he was expected to be confirmed. 

[24 hours before the announcement of the PdR on Savona.](http://mobile.ilsole24ore.com/solemobile/main/art/notizie/2018-05-23/braccio-ferro-il-quirinale-ministero-dell-economia-221418.shtml?uuid=AE7o7etE)

The parties and PdR have been discussing the matter for weeks and we now know that Mattarella proposed two other names (members of the Liga) for the ministry. 


&gt;This is pathetic spinning that nobody really believes (maybe you do, but not the people selling it to you). The President has never refused the nomination of a minister due to disagreeing with certain public policy views of that minister. It's never happened, it's a violation of the constitution and of every tradition of Italy's political mechanisms. This is not how this prerogative is supposed to be exercised

This only holds true if you believe that the *ratio* behind the rejection was the different political opinion. I have an indipendent opinion, as you do, and disagree. Is that hard to accept?

I'm an economist, not a psychiatrist, and this sort of denial of reality is a matter for the latter, not the form.

Foreign investment in China has been allowed for a long time, but with the caveat that the shares must be majority-Chinese held, but they are loosening up on that now as well. This isn't uniquely Chinese, either, the US has a requirement that strategic industries such as airlines must be US-owned.

They recently dropped the majority-Chinese requirement on banks, for example, so that banks can now be majority foreign-owned, and within three years can be 100% foreign-owned.

Also, it is possible to invest even as a retail investor in Chinese public companies. There are some valid questions as the legal structure of the ownership but many of the largest public Chinese companies from Sinopec to China Mobile to the four big Chinese banks are listed in either New York or Hong Kong and can be bought by anyone. Indeed the largest Chinese internet companies are not even listed in China, Tencent is listed in Hong Kong, not the mainland, while Alibaba is not even listed there but chose New York for its IPO. *Chinese investors* can't buy it.

As well as all this, qualified foreign institutional investors like Vanguard are authorised to buy stocks listed only in Shanghai or Shenzen, so you can get into ownership of mainland Chinese shares that way as well, through a mutual fund or ETF.

951,"&gt; There's a difference between representing people and issues and actually being populist.

No, you can easily be populist AND represent only a specific part of the population. You don't have to pretend that there is a unified will of the people to be a populist. You can openly represent some specific demographic group and promise them unrealistic shit - if you do that purely with the intention to gain votes from them, knowing that it won't ever be possible to deliver such promises, in other words promising them something that you yourself don't believe in, thant that's a populist strategy. In this sense, most politicians and parties are populist, they just differ in how much.

&gt; Any party that follows this structure is by definition anti-democratic which is where the issue lies. The former is anti-democratic because without minority opinions being recognized and even cherished there is no democratic society. The latter is undemocratic because that elevates them above all other parties and aims to give them a reason to push back against people who disagree with them - aka ""enemies of the people"".

Yep, I agree that this is indeed problematic and a disturbing mechanism.

&gt; Oddly specific example, but yeah, that one counts - if you consider for example how they treat their press as ""not particularly oppressive"".

Well by 'not particularely oppresive' I meant that they do not act violently against the opposition/dissent, they mostly don't throw them in prison either, they 'only' crush them financially in most cases. That's a relatively soft method of semi-authoritarian regimes.

I mentioned Singapore because it is indeed such a good example of a country that was able to create such good living conditions for people that they really do not mind about their semi-authoritarian methods. We've recently had a guest professor at our Uni, a white Briton, living in Singapore for decades now. An educated, smart man, with no illussions about the Singaporean government, he even explained to us how exactly they push out opposition and dissenting opinions and yet in the end he also said that that if he were able to vote in Singapore (he can't for now), he'd vote for the governmental party as well. Because the country works, as he put it. It works better than his native country, or any other country that he lived in - US and Canada.

&gt; Please, that's the exact same approach the FN made or the German AfD regularly alludes to. The 'reform' is a mere excuse to push for an exit because without the evil EU dictatorship everything would magically be fixed.

Well perhaps in the long term, Italy's exit from eurozone might not be such a bad thing. If it is accompanied by other structural reforms.

&gt; a couple generations your grand-grand-children come to my house and ask if they can stay in my broom closet, because their house is still cinders and there's a sectarian war going on

Not everything bad happening in the world is the fault of a former colonizer (scapegoating of this sort held Irish economic development back for many decades), and from a practical perspective it seems like people for all sorts for different reasons have huge trouble with accepting migrants returning to their native lands if peace occurs. Migrants? Or colonizers? It's a fair question.

If every time there is a war, you accept the partisans of one side in the conflict as refugees - the result would be that your country would become a base for the extension of foreign wars even if you had a benign foreign policy past and present.

This is one reason why the rightists have been pointing out that the closer the refugees to the approximate conflict source - the more likely peace is. I don't think even if a former colony is to blame for a conflict - that further colonization is the answer by either the natives of one land or the other. I thought the point was to reduce that sort of action.

I have no idea how disability pension system works in Italy and yes, 200 euros a month is clearly a sum that is impossible to live on. I suggest you re-read my comment and think about it from another perspective. 

For example, you getting a job is more important than a pensioner currently earning 1000€ a month getting a raise in income. That's because you would be able to earn your own income, pay taxes etc, while just raising pension is a cost for the state. Now of course, there are always a bunch of people who can't work, and who need handout to survive. But these handouts come from taxes, which employees pay.

1058,"&gt; In your world referendums mean nothing, you just add a really to the next one and continue until you get a result you like.

And in your world referendums are absolute and are valid for eternity even if the circumstances have changed. And you are baffled by me? Look into the mirror what type of world you just created.

&gt;If you can redo a referendum once nothing stops you from redoing it for 20th time, this is why it's so important to actually treat them seriously and not like a game like you want to.

And? The citizens then can act according to their wishes and vote the politicians who bring them repeatedly up out.

&gt;If the voters didn't treat it seriously and not showed up or voted with zero research then they should get punished for it, democracy is not a thing to toy with, otherwise just abolish it competently.

But with your stance on referendums you just destroyed democracy outright. Democracy is fluid, your definition of referendums are static. Right now it's questionable if the majority is still for brexit.

What you say right now is: Even if the majority now is against brexit, because in the past there was a majority for it we have to continue on Ms Mays wild ride.

And to that i quote you:

1164,"The Euro is flawed because member states can’t control monetary policy at a member state level (monetary policy= adjusting money supply and interest rates). That is something the ECB currently is in charge of. 

How do you deal with the issue of needing an interest rate hike in one member state when another could use an interest rate decrease? The Euro prevents you from doing that, and your only remaining options are fiscal policy (increase/lower tax, and in this case it’s increasing VAT).

This problem can be solved by either getting rid of the Euro and maintaining the status quo of a confederation of member states, or federalizing and having a federal budget. 

Which would mean ceding sovereignty to a central authority. And as much as I want a United States of Europe, I don’t think local governments and the local populace would be ok with that.

Also, VAT as a tax collection mechanism is required by the EU, I believe the minimum required is 15%, however most member states implemented it at 20ish%. 

It’s a tax all member states must implement upon joining the EU. +20%, or one fifth, is a ridiculous amount to pay for any item that you purchase.

1220,"Any MP could file a request for impeachment to the speaker of the House they belong to. As soon as this happens, a joint committee formed by members of immunity committees of both Houses meets to decide if the accusations are grounded or not. They have at least five months to do their investigations. Then, if they think that there is some ground for charging the President, they present their findings to both Houses together during a special joint session. During this session MPs vote by secret ballot whether the President should be indicted or not, and an absolute majority of members is required to proceed. If that's the case, the President is brought before the Constitutional Court, whose usual 15 judges are supplemented by 16 more judges drawn from a list of people which the Parliament prepares every nine years. At this point it goes on like a trial: the Parliament elects one or more prosecutors, the President has his defendant(s) and the Court acts as a Tribunal: investigations, hearings, and finally sentence.

I simply don't think that such a language would be considered a good investment of time and effort by the majority of people who are supposed to be using it.

And by ""close proximity"", I mean Literally within the same city. You use Indonesian as an example of what the end goal for MS is. However, the reason why it is used is because in Indonesian cities, speakers of many different languages interact with eachother on a daily basis. What would the average Bulgarian need MS for? The occasional vacation to Croatia? Even in places like Bosnia where several different ethnicities coexist, the languages are simillar enough to where MS is redundant.

If you took a couple thounsand people from every Slavic country and plopped them into a single city, then a common Slavic language would be useful. But right now, between the natural aversion we have to panslavism (which I'm sure you've noticed) and the lack of need for such a language, I personally don't think it's going to go anywhere.

No, representative democracy is not and has never been about doing what the people want, it is about getting the right people elected to do what they think is the right thing for the country *in their own best judgement*. That is what the ""representative"" part in representative democracy is all about - you elect someone to represent your interests, not to do everything you tell them to do. 

Popular opinion should not directly determine policy or run the country. This is an almost universally terrible idea that hasn't worked out well for anybody (except Switzerland and it's starting to work out poorly for them, too).

The EU better pay for it or make it on its own. But that's just how IP works, right? You develop it, you own it. That's not exactly what is being discussed. 

On top of that, the companies/researchers in the UK that contributed have been paid. Knowledge also doesn't vanish, so it's not like the UK hasn't gotten anything out of it.

But general funding? Just like contributions to the EU budget, once you leave you can't really expect to get a refund, unless there's some trial period, and I don't think that's the case here, even though the whole brexit-situation makes it feel like the whole UK membership was one big trial period.

I can't subscribe to netflix, not watch anything and say I want my money back (well, depending on the company, maybe you can...). You're going to argue the contributions to the research are not the same as a netflix subscription, and you're right, but the UK knew what it was getting itself into. First you contribute to EU programs and then proceed to leave the EU. That doesn't mean you suddenly get all your contributions refunded.

As a sidenote, the UK is responsible for 15% of the EU's GDP and has 13% of the population, so 14% contribution doesn't seem that far off (both per capita and as a % of gdp).

1677,"&gt; Some suspect that this is what the populists wanted all along and this is why the insisted on an anti-euro finance minister.

Hmm.

Why is that guy so controversial, anyway?

He can't take Italy out of the euro alone, right?  I understand that there's no Italian public support for leaving the euro, which means that doing so would be politically-damaging even if the government tries doing so without a referendum.  And it's not even clear to me that he *wants* to leave the euro.  When I went searching for him, I just saw that he said that ""joining the euro was a mistake"", which is not at all the same thing as saying ""now we should leave it"".  I saw *The Sun* have an article that claimed that he wanted to ""leave the euro"", but it seemed to me that it merely drew that conclusion from the fact that he said that Italy should not have joined.  I cannot find any quote online where he is advocating for Italy to leave the euro now.

Leaving the euro doesn't appear to be in the platform that the parties ran on, yes?

The point of greatest concern was that he said ""Italy should form a Plan B to handle leaving the euro"".  Now, okay, sure, that's a precondition to leaving -- if it *doesn't* happen, Italy cannot (reasonably) leave.  But it's far from clear to me that that's this indicates that he wants to leave the euro.

* His phrasing indicates that he considers this an undesirable, fallback option -- a ""Plan B"" is not what you actually want to do, but a contingency plan.

* It seems plausible to me to believe that Italy would want to be able to credibly *threaten* leaving the euro, and I assume that having a plan would also be a precondition for this.  The Greek Tsipras administration did not want to default, but *did* want to threaten doing so.  Obviously, that's not *good* -- just as in Greece, shaking bondholder confidence can have serious effects.  But it also is not the same as actually leaving.

I mean, if the government had agreed on a platform of leaving the euro or if public support was in favor of leaving the euro and the government had promised a referendum, it seems to me that that'd legitimately be concerning for the euro.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8mjloj/italys_conte_gives_up_bid_for_government/dzod1y8/,vokegaf,1527456398

That you don't have to do if you don't want to. Yeah, definitely sounds like slavery to me /s.

&gt;No it is mandatory to cut it short and why is not ""recommended"" to the females that voluntarily join then?
We both know that it isn't for any practical reasons; it's to promote gender roles and patriotism which is the only reason this institution exists; it isn't for any practical reason.

No, the point of the institution is in the hour of need to protect Finland's independence, and to keep a decently sized reserve as a deterrent to outside threats since the cost of invading would be too high, you really can't be this stupid. 

Also, men don't have to shave their heads in the army anymore, you can most definitely keep longer hair in a bun. Also women can shave their heads too if they want to, they aren't expected to, but they can. It is simply more hygienic when having your helmet on a week straight to not have said weeks worth of sweat and grease on your (long) hair.

&gt;I'm in every thread about every country that does it but strangely only in the Finnish threads do all the Finns swarm in to proudly defend their apartheid state; it's almost like the nationalistic brainwashing has been effective and they experience blind love for their backwards slave state.

Because you are constantly shit talking our country, you twat. You also seem to not know the meaning of apartheid SINCE IT DOESN'T EXIST HERE AND NEVER HAS.

The problem seems to be that the police didn't believe the victims because they were lower class trouble making ""chavs"" who ""wanted it"" or whatever. 

This kind of prejudice is common with the police unfortunately, they often come up with excuses for their incompetence that will resonate with the public. For example after the hillsborough disaster, police blamed Liverpool football fans for barrier hopping which causes the over crowding. This worked for a while because people from liverpool had a reputation of being lower class theives.  In this case it's ""oh we couldn't arrest them because people would call us racist on twitter"". 

It's a flimsy excuse only believed by people who want to believe that narrative. Why the hell would police care if they got called racist by some nobody after arresting rapists?

B. So you are telling me that, since the only incentive for humans to produce *valuable* things is to be rewarded (economically, I assume), it is better to leave those very same humans to freely manage their acquired wealth without government intervention. People who would only move a finger *for* money, being trusted to do the *right thing*. Yeah, that would work.

C. What I get from this is that anything *essential* shouldn't be trusted to private hands. Also, I don't care if Samsung makes cellphones, I care if one of them explodes in my hands, which seems to have happened to some people not so long ago. Yet, Samsung is doing pretty well this year, which means that the *free market* doesn't really care.

D. Totally not how the housing bubble happened, amirite.

E. Private companies lobby politicians on daily basis. Media corporations have enough power to turn tables in an election. And you're telling me that *pleasing voters is the main issue here*?

Gosh, what is this? Libertarianism 101?

1823,"&gt;Comatose patients are a drain on society. But that's no reason why you should be allowed to murder them. A comatose patient is because he or she is has rights as a human being, or at least at something resembling a human being. We know it's wrong even without thinking about it.

True. Although I do think people in a coma who will never recover should have the right to euthanasia, but that's a different story. 

&gt;The problem is always the same, from the moment you grant the right to life to something unborn, this right will always triumph over all other reasons. It doesn't matter anymore whether these reasons are based on a whim or not. So the answer to your question is never. And that includes rape. I don't see how anyone could accept that that which has the right to life, would not have the right to life when it is the product of rape. It would clearly be injust. An original sin.

Yeah, but the fetus cannot survive outside of the womb until the pregnancy reaches the 24th week. Beyond week 24, no country I know of allows abortion. And I don't think it's a wrong assumption that the fetus still isn't a human being at that point, because a human being can survive independent of their mother. So the question boils down to: when can we consider something a human being? 

There are a few facts I know though: a 24 week fetus cannot feel pain, has no awareness of the fact it is ""alive"", it isn't yet conscious and cannot survive independently of their mother. After 18-20 weeks of pregnancy, an ultrasound can be done to determine whether the child will have birth defects, including birth defects that can be lethal shortly after the child is born. 

So I think it makes sense to leave it up to the mother. I do not support abortion after 24 weeks, because at that point, the child will have a chance of survival independent of their mother (though they will need medical care, of course).

Also noteworthy, Israel's military duty regardless of gender, or the high representation of minorities in the US army.

2151,"&gt;The idea of the [Good Country Index](https://goodcountry.org/index/about-the-index) is simple: to measure what each country on earth contributes to the common good of humanity, and what it takes away, relative to its size. Using a wide range of data from the U.N. and other international organisations, we’ve given each country a balance-sheet to show at a glance whether it’s a net creditor to mankind, a burden on the planet, or something in between.
&gt;
We're not making moral judgments about countries. What we mean by a Good Country is something much simpler: it’s a country that contributes to the greater good of humanity. A country that serves the interests of its own people, but without harming - and preferably by advancing - the interests of people in other countries too. 

[F.A.Q.](https://goodcountry.org/index/your-questions/background)

[Source data.](https://goodcountry.org/index/source-data)
&gt;We have used 35 reliable datasets which measure how countries affect the world outside their own borders: there are five of these in each of seven categories, covering the big issues like education, science, war and peace, trade, culture, health, censorship, the environment, freedom, etc. Most of these datasets are produced by the United Nations system and other international agencies, and a few by NGOs and other organisations.

And what if I told you that those 200k women fixed on abortion will do it, no matter the legality? They will go to a country where it's legal (if they can afford it) or pick some basement where less than safe procedure will be used by a possibly non-medical staff.

Besides, the GPPR isn't just bad for loads of American companies. There are also American companies that could turn this around in a big competitive advantage. Google and Facebook for example are in great positions to do market research of which they can sell the anonymized results to advertisers. For now, that looks like a step down from tracking users all over the internet, but if nobody can do that anymore they are definitely going to conquer market share from companies that now get their info ONLY from tracking. It's like having a factory that makes both swords and axes. If all your competitors only make swords and swords are suddenly forbidden, you have an enormous relative advantage because demand for axes will boom.

2241,"&gt; Almost a quarter of the respondents said that Israel declared its independence after 1980. A third indicated correctly that the nation was established in 1948.

Newspapers always like to point out this kind of ""ignorance"", as if it was specific about the subject they are discussing. 

But make a poll about the shape of the earth, and roughly as many people as those that believe that Israel became a country in the 1980s will answer that our planet is flat. 

The truth is that at least a significant minority of every country is ignorant about most things considered basic knowledge. They don't know the shape or age of the earth, if the sun is a star or something else, when did WW2 start or end, when did the Soviet Union collapse, whether vaccines cause autism or not, believe that Austria is in the Southern Pacific, that Brazilians speak spanish, that HIV has been created in a lab, that nuclear plants produce more CO2 than coal-fired plants etc. 

So of course, millions of French people have no idea about the date of creation of a country located 4 000 kms away, where 0.12% of the world's population is living.

The pronunciation is completely alien for Slavic speakers. Hot potato in your mouth is not a joke but reality. The articles are foreign - as your case illustrates as well. Not talking about completely foreign spelling, word order, tenses, culture etc etc etc....

Again 5% - 10% of people in Slavic countries can speak English in a meaningful way. The more east you go the less speakers of English you will find. 

Now, if I go on a vacation to Croatia and I speak English with locals I feel like an idiot. The same with Poles. MS allows me to be me, that's all. 

It's a zonal language like Swahili or Indonesian. It doesn't aim to replace English nor your native Slavic language. It wants to allow Slavs to speak in MS among themselves - a language that all Slavs feel is their own and not foreign like English.

So what? Doesn't make the arguments wrong? That the GPLv2 death penalty is not enforceable in Europe is pretty much legal fact and despite this the SFC continues to say that it is and ""forgets"" to update their website because they want people to switch to v3 so it's in their interst to overplay the downsides of v2.

&gt; Whole free software community agrees with FSF and SF Conservancy stance on this, everyone who does not is either promoting open source instead of free software for their own gain or does not understand that viral influence of GPL is what made free and open source software even possible in first place.

You have not read a word of what I said have you?

The viral influence has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that the SFC continues to claim that the GPLv2 death penalty exists while multiple courts have ruled it is not enforceable.

For crying out loud the argument of the SFC relies on the fact that the death penalty clause of V2 was a mistake written before the FSF realized that projects could emerge with thousands fo copyright holders and if it actually was enforceable indeed it would be very unfortunate but it isn't enforceable.",,/r/europe/comments/8m3ngi/mozilla_will_not_update_its_privacy_policy_it/dznczg7/,geile_zwarte_kousen,1527406228

Okay:

- The FSF and SFC continue to assert that the GPLv2 has the ""death penalty"" where if you break compliance once you can only regain it after securing permission from _all_ copyright holders which is virtually impossible when there are thousands of them and this was an oversight when the GPLv2 was written as an argument for why you should switch to GPLv3 which they both want; while it's true that how the licence is written this is the case this part of the GPLv2 has long been ruled unenforceable in courts across the world as long as the GPLv2 is a general public licence extended to everyone then you gain the licence again the moment you come into compliance again courts have ruled.

- The FSF and SFC continue to assert that dynamic linking creates a derivative work and as such is subject to the viral nature of the GPL; the reality is that whether dynamic linking indeed  creates a derivative work under copyright law is an open legal question that has never been answered in court; the FSF lawyers are of the opinion that dynamic linking creates a derivative work whereas many other lawyers are of the opinion that it does not and Canonical's lawyers are even of the opinion that kernel modules that directly interface with the kernel do not form a derivative work and as such dare to distribute ZFS with Linux which the SFC assert as fact that it violates copyright but this has never been tested in court.

- The FSF on the page of its RYF mark conveniently forgets to mention that if you read the fine print that in order to get it you have to use FSF-approved terminology which has nothing to do with respecting anyone's freedom; the FSF publicly brands RFY as a mark that tests whether a vendor respects the user's freedom while behind the screens it's a front to further FSF politics.",,/r/europe/comments/8m3ngi/mozilla_will_not_update_its_privacy_policy_it/dzn9log/,geile_zwarte_kousen,1527399377

 Zionism is a Jewish conspiracy meant to manipulate Western societies to benefit Jews.

That’s the belief of a majority of 1,007 French respondents to a poll about the Jewish nationalist movement.

Some 53 percent of the respondents to the survey conducted this year by the Ifop polling company agreed with the statement that “Zionism is an international organization that seeks to influence the world and societies to the Jews’ benefit,” the Union of Jewish Students in France, or UEJF, said in a report this week about the poll that it commissioned Ifop to perform.

Of those, 11 percent said they “strongly agree.” Half of the respondents said Zionism was a “racist ideology.”

At the same time, 54 percent of respondents agreed that anti-Zionism is a form of anti-Semitism and 59 percent agreed with the statement that Zionism is a “movement of liberation and emancipation for the Jewish people.”

Twenty-six percent of respondents said they thought a boycott Israel was justified. Israel’s existence “feeds anti-Semitism,” 38 percent of the respondents said.

The poll also revealed widespread hostility toward and ignorance about Israel.

Almost a quarter of the respondents said that Israel declared its independence after 1980. A third indicated correctly that the nation was established in 1948.

Israel was described as a “threat to regional stability” by 57 percent of respondents and as a “theocracy” by 51 percent. The assertions that Israel is a democracy and is a “normal country like all other” received approval ratings of 46 and 48 percent, respectively.",,/r/europe/comments/8mfv5t/in_french_poll_majority_say_zionism_is_a_jewish/dzna88t/,ferrariprius,1527400535

In comparison, the Muslim population that has come here to work are generally younger and have more kids.

That doesn't mean you will see an explosion of the Muslim population, demographics take a long time to make a significant change.

2622,"Well in my opinion it is time for every monarchy to finally become a republic.

It is 2018 and the Western World has embraced democracy, Monarchs are an archaic function still in existence mostly because of emotional reasons.

Monarchs are still mostly above the law and for example the British and Dutch monarch have the power to refuse to sign a law that the democratic government has agreed upon.

Many people argue that monarchs will never do this because if they do they will lose support but to me this same argument is against the monarchy.

If the people don't want the monarch to use those powers the monarch should not have those powers.

The Dutch monarch also doesn't pay taxes and the princes(ses) get huge budgets to hire personal employees from the government (paid by taxes) and student financing that is way higher than for citizens.

In Western countries it is accepted that everyone is equal before the law... except monarchs.

In many countries the difference between insulting some random person on the street and insulting the monarch is the difference between someone disliking you and as in this case literally having to flee your country to escape prosecution.

Some people argue that the monarch functions as a figurehead to unite the country but presidents seem to be fairly sufficient for this.

The manner in which people see their monarch is too extreme in my opinion, especially in the UK.

This is of course not across the whole population but the UK has a strong personality cult around their monarch.

And yes, royals often spent lots of time on helping charities but you don't need to be undemocratic to do so, you just need to have a lot of money and be a good person.

The only argument that can be made in favor that are based on reason and not emotion are tourism and better tradedeals with oil producing countries that respect monarchies (read: Saudi-Arabia)

But we should move on from oil (and other fossil fuels) anyway. Even if you do not believe in climate change there is a finite amount of oil on Earth and there will come a time where the Earth's supply reaches 0 (or more probable: the only oil that is left is so inaccessible that it is cheaper to switch to renewables anyway than to extract those last remnants)

tl;dr monarchs don't pay taxes, monarchs profit heavily from taxes, they have dictatorial powers that they happen to choose not to use, both stand above the law themselves and laws affect people that do something to the monarch unequally, and they are inherently undemocratic.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8md4fq/rapper_fled_spain_to_belgium_to_avoid_prison/dzmylu2/,salami350,1527384532

2670,"&gt;Your elderly poverty rate is FIVE TIMES HIGHER.

Except that some people below the poverty rate in the US are close to the median income in NL.

Maybe you should stop bragging about things you don't understand.

Median income after taxes and transfers in the US is $44,049/year, according to *actual* OECD statistics. http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/united-states/

Median income after taxes and transfers in NL is $28,737/year. Again, *actual* OECD data. http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/netherlands/

What you're referring to as a poverty rate is actually a measure of people earning 40% or less of the median income. It's more a measure of inequality than actual poverty.  Because median income in the US is significantly higher than in the NL, the poverty level cutoff is likewise much higher.  

So it's *idiotic* to insist that the elderly poverty rate the in the US is much higher than the elderly poverty rate in NL, when the ""poor"" in the US are making not to much below the median income in NL.

If Italy, Spain and Greece was not part of the Eurozone, the Euro would appreciate, increasing purchasing power, tax receipts and benefit pensioners in the Eurozone memberstates.

But most importantly, the stagnant mediteranean governments would be able to stimulate their economies without convincing Germany to foot the bill.

But I am beginning to think that it is too late to save the ship. It has been 10 years since the debt crisis, and Greece is still barely solvent and Italy and Spain has rising debts and feeble governments (to say the least). Without the Euro these things would be straight forward to fix: The Italian, Spanish and Greek central banks would just ease monetary policy without any risk of getting even near negative interest rates.

ECJ authority over citizen rights in the UK would mean that the EU would be getting *extraterritorial judicial authority* in the UK.  That's highly abnormal and could have very-hard-to-evaluate legal effects.  That was what my textbooks highlighted as one of the more-abusive things that the UK imposed on China in the colonial era.

I mean, the border stuff, reneging on payments/being compelled to make payments, unfavorable trade conditions...everything else is well within the sort of normal deals that countries cut.

I cannot imagine a country *ever* agreeing to something like that, bar under military compulsion.

The [Brexit crowd was pissed over that ask](https://brexitcentral.com/eus-unacceptable-ecj-demands-create-privileged-caste-eu-citizens-superior-rights-uk/), and on that point, I'm perfectly-aligned with them.  That shouldn't have been asked, and shouldn't be granted.  It's neither necessary nor normal.

I mean, there were dick moves on both sides.  I recall some folks in the Brexit crowd saying ""no payments and we deny the legitimacy of *any* legal venue in which to raise the issue of payments"".  That was pretty unreasonable.  The border back-and-forth doesn't reflect all that well on anyone, I think.

2740,"&gt; Ok, thought you were referring to it being a predominant way of thinking. I think the truth is that we shouldn't lock ourself into one way of thinking anyway, but I get shivers down my spine thinking about what would happen if we had followed Austrian economics during the 2008 crash.

If we had followed Austrian economics then the 2008 crash wouldn't have happened in the first place. It happened because the government got involved. At first the Fed mandated that easier loans need to be given to people so they can buy houses, then Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac took on a lot more risks with subprime loans, because the prevailing thought was that the US government would bail them out. That's exactly what happened too. On top of that credit at the time was cheap. It was absolutely the fault of the regulators. You can't fully blame the bankers when the Fed told them that if they have stricter lending guidelines than they do then action will be taken against the bank.

&gt;Also, for me personally ""the cookie law"" has made me think about countless times the pages I visit and question what their intentions were, some I have stopped going to.

Now consider the costs of it. Collectively millions were likely spent on just adding that box and we collectively probably spent years of time dealing with that pop up. And for what? Nothing, because the browser already did all the things better than what the pop ups were for. You wouldn't want to rely on the pop up anyway in case the website just doesn't notify you. The website can't escape the browser though. Anyone that knew how that system works should've been able to tell them that the law was stupid.

&gt;Think about it this way, you don't want your doctor to reveal or use your private medical data to enrich himself/herself, so even if it cost tons extra we make hospitals, private practitioners etc implement secure connection servers and archiving.

In my mind there's a difference between this data and much of the data internet companies use. I don't really care that much if Google figures out that I like airplanes and ships, but I don't want random people to know my medical history.

The problem for all of this is that if the rest of the world doesn't follow in our footsteps then any EU company that serves consumers will be at a disadvantage.",,/r/europe/comments/8m9592/gdpr_a_new_privacy_law_makes_europe_worlds/dzmt0d3/,RoughSeaworthiness,1527377499

If the Eurozone were abolished, faith in the European economy will be shaken, and that faith can have more tangible economic effect than any policy. People act irrationally and won't calculate economic effects.

How is that different from TV? Unless they're basing it directly off of subscriptions that are for a single channel, they have to get demographic data some other way.

That is a bit simplistic because at the end of your hypothetical ad revenue stands a product which has to be sold.

&gt;No, I was putting that as a fact to show that the US is in fact the largest web market on earth by revenue. 

Actually I was referring to the total marketing volume, which is off course bigger because in Europe, it is split up between different countries. Anyway, I have no information on total revenue ""of data on the web"", so I'll give you that point. 

&gt;I am not aware of these little products you are talking about.

That is because I was talking about software in general and I didn't limit myself to web applications. 
Spotify is highly specialized because they do only one thing and trying to be as good at it as possible. Google on the other hand (or rather alphabet) does pretty much everything (this doesn't mean that they are bad at it, it just means they are not specialized). 

&gt;I don't want to wave the US flag against you waving the Euro flag, I am European, I just want Europe to make good use of it's skill.

Well I didn't assume that. Anyway I agree making good use of available skill is important. However, I don't think that the American model is either superior or could even work in Europe. 

&gt;Europe is an important market for both of those companies, and they both benefit from this regulation (once they go through the pain of implementing it) since it makes the barriers to competition higher for them.

Actually, no. It is a lot easier to design a system with this regulations in mind than making an old system fit this new regulations because things like deleting weren't thought of at the time. 

&gt;What I am saying, however, is they wouldn't make a global search engine, they certainly could not hope to compete with Google[...]

I disagree. As soon as somebody offers a better experience or just better search results people will start migrating. Google knows this and therefore buys every start up left and right to diversify their business.

I thought that it was a MiG, but apparently there were *two* theories there:

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/mh17-flight-ukrainian-pilot-accused-russia-shooting-plane-kills-himself-suicide-a8265901.html

&gt;Captain Vladyslav Voloshyn, who piloted a low-flying Su-25 attack jet, shot himself at home in Mykolaiv, his hometown in southern Ukraine, local media said.
&gt;
&gt; Russian officials and media had accused Mr Voloshyn of flying the jet which shot down the Boeing 777 passenger plane, killing all 298 people on board.

https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-this-photo-shows-a-ukraine-mig-29-shot-down-mh17.t5107/

&gt; Russian TV just released a satellite photo which shows an Ukraine Air Force Mig-29 just as it launches a rocket to a plane supposed to be the Boeing 777 of Malaysia (MH17)

https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/01/05/kremlins-shifting-self-contradicting-narratives-mh17/

&gt;A microcosm of the Kremlin’s shift on MH17 can be seen in the Ukrainian fighter jet conspiracy theory. In comment sections and YouTube videos you will often encounter talk of how a Ukrainian fighter jet, most common named as a Su-25 or a MiG-29, shot down MH17; however, the Kremlin has long abandoned the claim that this was the cause of the MH17 shoot down. Instead, throughout 2017, the Kremlin has thrown its entire weight behind the idea that a Ukrainian Buk system shot down MH17 from a position near Zaroshchenske.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8m8a8y/putin_dismisses_mh17_findings_and_says_of_course/dzmflc2/,vokegaf,1527362834

&gt; Vesna Vulović (Serbian Cyrillic: Весна Вуловић; pronounced [ˈʋeːsna ˈʋuːlɔʋit͡ɕ]; 3 January 1950 – 23 December 2016) was a Serbian flight attendant. **She holds the Guinness world record for surviving the highest fall without a parachute**: 10,160 metres **(33,330 ft)**. Her fall took place after an explosion tore through the baggage compartment of JAT Flight 367 on 26 January 1972, causing it to crash near Srbská Kamenice, Czechoslovakia. She was the sole survivor of the crash, which air safety investigators attributed to a briefcase bomb. The Yugoslav authorities suspected that Croatian nationalists were to blame, but no one was ever arrested.
&gt;
&gt; Following the crash, Vulović spent days in a coma and was hospitalized for several months. She suffered a fractured skull, three broken vertebrae, two broken legs, broken ribs and a fractured pelvis. These injuries resulted in her being temporarily paralyzed from the waist down. She made an almost complete recovery but continued to walk with a limp. Vulović maintained that she had no memory of the incident and thus had no qualms about flying in the aftermath of the crash. Despite her willingness to resume working as a flight attendant, JAT decided to give her a desk job negotiating freight contracts. The airline felt that her presence on flights would attract too much publicity. Vulović became a celebrity in Yugoslavia and was deemed a national hero.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8m8a8y/putin_dismisses_mh17_findings_and_says_of_course/dzmg64r/,vokegaf,1527363441

3078,"I disagree. Are you aware of the medical understanding regarding fetal sentience? Fetuses before 24 weeks are not sentient; they cannot even feel pain because that part of the brain hasn't developed yet:

&gt; Connections from the periphery to the cortex are not intact before 24 weeks of gestation. Most
pain neuroscientists believe that the cortex is necessary for pain perception; cortical activation
correlates strongly with pain experience and an absence of cortical activity generally indicates
an absence of pain experience.52–54 The lack of cortical connections before 24 weeks, therefore,
implies that pain is not possible until after 24 weeks. Even after 24 weeks, there is continuing
development and elaboration of intracortical networks. Furthermore, there is good evidence
that the fetus is sedated by the physical environment of the womb and usually does not awaken
before birth. [Source](https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/rcogfetalawarenesswpr0610.pdf)

That's exactly the point. Some major tech services don't intend to become GDPR compliant. Not because of the shady stuff they do but because of a lack of interest in playing the bureaucracy game. As I mentioned in my messages, GDPR isn't just about real data protection - it's also about a giant law-related hussle and tiny details that are only needed for the sake of existence of a whole new industry and a big bunch of lawyers - ""Data Protection"". Have you noticed that, per GDPR conditions, in quite a few cases organisations have to hire/assign a ""Data Regulator"" person who should be working in the company? 

Here in this subreddit it is popular to think that if someone doesn't want to be GDPR-compliant, it's about shadiness. In some cases it really is. 
But in AT LEAST 1/3 of these cases, it's actually about a disagreement with actual IMPLEMENTATION of ambiguous, awfully specified conditions that definitely require consultancy from external counselors and that still bring a huge risk in the future due to how GDPR policies are written.",,/r/europe/comments/8m9592/gdpr_a_new_privacy_law_makes_europe_worlds/dzm9nfy/,wisemanSSZ,1527356291

3109,"If we assume the billion dollar valuation level is the mark of global penetration, then outside of the UK and Sweden, Europe falls below East Asia in terms of successful web start ups while still having better access to the rest of the world.

&gt; Europe is one of the few places who can afford that because it is also the largest market in the world. 

In my opinion it cannot afford to do it because it isn't amongst the fastest growing markets. GDP across many sectors being collated together is not of any use here. There are web markets with billions of people in single countries, they are larger markets. We are not talking about selling cars here. In terms of advertising the top value is in the US followed by the other English speaking countries and then Europe.

In terms of those start ups you speak of, if they rely on ad-revenue, potentially through the largest revenue generators on the internet like DoubleClick (Google), then they are going to have less revenue from the next month guaranteed due to the 40% drop in programmatic ad purchases.

But to the point I made... notice none of the businesses I mentioned are start ups, they are established and fruitful global companies.

One of the fundamental elements of this is that if your software can't live without harvesting the personal information of every user that interacts with it, it might not be good software.
It is still an open question if tracking ads can be considered a necessity as they enhance profits, with will have to be decided in the future.

This would be true even if we had a slight population growth going. The population in many non-European countries is increasing pretty fast. The greying of Germany is just an additional issue on top of that. 

&gt;Sure. Lots. Is there any conflict with what I said?

Nice abstraction again. This is not a small barrier that can be easily overcome by magically causing a mere desire to have children in many people which most likely would not translate into the high numbers necessary to actually ""stop"" this trend anyways.

&gt;  How does this conflict with my position?

There are obviously strong systemic factors causing this for people living in developed countries. The issue is not nearly as simple as you make it out to be.

&gt;These are examples of things that are inputs to birth rate. I did not say ""here is a solution that I have placed in front of you"". I am giving classes of things from which a solution might be drawn.

Which is totally besides the point given that nothing here indicates that anything about my prediction was wrong. Especially in light of what we already attempted and what is happening in other countries.

&gt;Germans have undergone a genetic change since their emigre brothers moved to the New World that makes them irreligious?

Are you trying to provoke me by saying stupid shit? Religion really is not nearly as big a thing here as in the USA or Poland and the few people that care enough to have that have a significant impact on their important life choices like making children are probably already busy making children. Most young Germans would react very negatively or at least indifferent to any religious campaign of that kind and at least among the young people I know you would be considered a weirdo if you are an ethnic German and say you believe in God or are religious. The vast majority of us is at best what is called ""Papierchristen"" here, Christian only on paper, or rather ""cultural Christians"" that are often atheists or agnostics but that like to buy some stuff on Christmas.

&gt;their emigre brothers

Btw lol at this.

&gt; You write and interpret those rules;

There is this thing called separation of powers. The people in charge of e.g. interpreting our constitution will not be easily swayed by simplistic political calculations. Nor will btw the people all around the world whose job it is to interpret international laws.

&gt; They would have come from other places, though. 

Not nearly in the same numbers. Without those initial ""masses"" as a trigger and the situation in Syria as a background the policy changes which enabled further mass movements elsewhere would not have happened. Furthermore this is pure speculation on your part anyways and begs the question of why we did not have anything like that going on before.

&gt; Our nonselectivity comes in illegal Latin American immigration.

Afaik this has more to do with the difficulty of enforcing already existing laws and there are very many conflicting interests at work there. But you are the American, and you are most likely better informed *on that matter* than me.

&gt; You are removing a relatively-miniscule handful of those who arrive.

I would not call the numbers involved miniscule and obviously we have to work within the frameworks of local and international laws. Just dumping people somewhere, who often arrive without papers, like you implied we should do, would not only break our own laws but also entail shitting on the sovereignty of other countries that often do not want people back and where you often cannot even prove (or even know) that those people are actually their citizens anyways.

But it isn't just about it! GDPR is VERY ambiguous, and very complex when it comes to details. At the moment, with current implementation, GDPR is a pain for almost any business that really intends to play by the rules. 

I expect, most of companies will now just throw the dust in the eyes with ""Updated privacy policy"" document, with ""Checkboxes"" disabling email campaigns etc. And customers will believe that GDPR is implemented.

3216,"While I agree that the law should be enforced (indeed, all laws should be enforced to the letter without discretion or mercy, to force parliament to write proper laws and to prevent favouritism or discrimination by law enforcement and prosecutors), the law itself about court records and reporting is rather flawed and outdated. 

We could improve the process by having all statements by the lawyers presented in pure text on a screen and synthesised into speech or read out by a clerk, and vetted by the other side and the judge before the jury or witnesses see it (so they can’t engage in any theatrics or say things to get them into the jury’s minds). Likewise witnesses and parties should be recorded and only the recording of the relevant  answers to approved questions shown to the jury, so they can’t say anything improper and so there’s a perfect record of what was said and shown.  That record can then be published completely if the person is convicted and sealed forever unless the accused wants it released if he is acquitted (though a redacted version stripped of all identifying information except expert witness identities should still be published). 

A few other worthwhile changes would be 

-	banning any evidence which does not relate directly to the facts of the accused’s guilt until after conviction, so the prosecution can’t outrage the jury; 
-	using larger pools of  unrelated jurors to determine accurately  whether things look banned (porn models appear to be under 18, logos look like trademarks, and so on); 
-	requiring the police and prosecutors to have no communication with suspects or their lawyers which is not recorded (audio and video) to prevent improper pressure; 
-	spousal privilege should be abolished
-	juries should be permitted to send questions to the parties and experts. 
-	criminal conviction should automatically lead to civil liability for the harm done, with only the amount of harm to be determined where a fixed scale can’t be used or the amount isn’t determined by the criminal trial",,/r/europe/comments/8m8hm3/tommy_robinson_arrested_while_filming_outside/dzlwx8b/,try_____another,1527340834

3222,"&gt; That's true but it's the same thing as Rajoy being appointed with PSOE's and C's support. That doesn't mean that all of them share the same opinions etc

No, they do not share all their opinions, but whatever difference there is, it must be smaller than what gather them together. Otherwise they wouldn't have done it. I think C's and PSOE must take some responsability for putting Rajoy in the presidency, yes.
However, the difference is that PSOE and C's supported Rajoy to become president, but they did NOT enter in the government. Entering in a government is another whole new level.

I think in this country, we are too forgiving with politicians (I mean all of us, not only independentists, of course) and we value too much the individual politician, instead of the idea or the movement. In this case, Puigdemont doesn't want to be pushed aside, and thus he wants to elect himself the appointee, but, why? Sure, many people want to see him as the ""real"" president, but, isn't the movement more important than Puigdemont? Puigdemont wants a weak successor, because he wants to come back. Therefore he needs to prevent the next president of doing what he did to Mas. I understand his position. What I don't understand is the position of ERC, which did not only help to push Torra as the president, but also entered in the government with him, instead of serving as an external support for a certain number of topics. CUP, for example, did that. They abstained, and thus they gave their support to Torra, but at least they did not enter in the government.

I think these two cases (Rajoy and Puigdemont) fall under the umbrella of ""comulgar con ruedas de molino"". Another example is the cabinet that Torra presented: The most gender unbalanced cabinet in Spain in the last decade. Why? Are there no good female candidates for such cabinet? I would think that it should be the case, considering how much support the movement has. Why ERC, which is always filling their mouth with gender equality, etc, hasn't say anything against it? Why are so many independentists voters defending ""this is not the time for this issues, we have to make a republic"". Wouldn't it take exactly the same effort and time to ""make the republic"" with a more balanced cabinet? The answer is Yes and the answer to why ERC hasn't say anything is because they are willing to put up with anything that JxCAT launch at them without protesting, just like C's is willing to make a blind eye with the overloading corruption of PP if that helps to stop the independentists movement.

&gt;If you say that Torra was a bad choice to appoint, then I agree with you. Some people say he was only the 4th choice and someone had to be appointed etc. , which is true, but still I'd be the first to say that I'm sure there were better options. Going from there to saying that everyone that supports independence is a racist supremacist, which is what some people in this and other threads try to say, is what I take issue and disagree with because imo it's just not true.

I agree with this last paragraph, I understand why many people would want ""whoever the next candidate is"" because they want a government now. I don't mean that all independentists are supremacist and I am sorry if I expressed myself poorly.

But I think the discussion is much deeper than that: I think that any and all nationalism is based on ""us vs them"". Nations are build by conflict. And in Catalonia, that conflict has been pushed for decades (it did not started in 2016) with the idea that Catalans are not only different from Spaniards, but better. Torra himself put it nicely in one of his articles, Oriol Junqueras with his comment on ADN discrepancies. Or many of the opinion articles in El Punt Avui in the last two years, for example. Many texts of the ""heroes"" and ""intellectual fathers"" of the Catalan nationalism are not very different from the Trump speeches (probably better written, however).

Again, it is not just Torra, because he is just the symptom. Pujol, who many consider the father of the modern Catalan nationalism, said 30 years ago of the ""Andalusian man"", that it is a ""destroyed, chaotic man"", some sort of conqueror that should be kept at bay or would destroy Catalonia. Yes, Torra himself said to two PSOE politicians with 4 ""Spanish"" last names that ""there is no space in Catalonia for all of us"". But Marta Rovira, from ERC, compelled in Twitter to Inés Arrimadas to ""go back to Andalusia"". Yes, she apologized afterwards, but if in your moment of ""heat"" you would call a black person the n-word, you are probably more racist than you might consider yourself. And yes, people like Gabriel Rufián are also Andalusian by birth, but they are a part ""of the movement"" and thus they are ""true Catalans"". It is just like the black/Hispanic Trump supporter, who serves the only purpose of being used as a shield against criticism (""I cannot be racist, I have a black friend"").

That kind of comments, that kind of ideas are not just Torra's, or a small part of the movement. They are fundamental to it and, as much as many people reject them publicly and it is only once in a while that the resurface noticibly, it is also something that impregnates unconsciously those who are in touch with that ideology. Just like with Spanish nationalism, French nationalism, American nationalism, etc. As another example, Ciudadanos is trying to capitalize in a newly resurfaced Spanish nationalism that contains the kind of dangerous elements and that is why I denounce their strategy. One may support Ciudadanos because of their neoliberal economical policies, or because they think Spain would be better with all its parts together. However, that speech of Spanish nationalism will also impregnate them, even if they think they are immune to it at first.

In summary, would you say that Trump is the problem, or is he a symptom of a certain type of speech impregnating a society? I am sure many of his voters are not publicly racist and they just want jobs back and improve the economy. I consider Torra's to be the same case: Many people have supported him, ""pinching their nose"", because they want ""the republic"", a government, etc., but that doesn't mean they are not supporting that ideology and probably being more convinced by it day after day (because that is how human groups work: exposition and peer pressure are two very strong froces).

An abortion in Romania is pretty expensive, just the initial procedure costs a month's minimum salary, so the only people who can get them are educated city dwellers, who also have ready access to contraception. Problem is that freeing up abortion after a period of it being illegal has created a ""why should I bother raising a child"" mindset with women running away from responsibility of trouble of giving birth.

This has been mitigated by the rise of the church, and the introduction of religion in schools, but the numbers are still obscenely high in some areas\- a 2007 survey had 50&amp;#37; of Romanian women with at least one abortion since 1990.

Robinson was already under a suspended sentence for similar 'reporting' in a previous case, which the judge explained to him in no uncertain terms violated the strict liability rule (see link above for reference). The judge told him back then:

*""In short, Mr. Yaxley-Lennon, turn up at another court, refer to people as ""Muslim paedophiles, Muslim rapists"" and so on and so forth while trials are ongoing and before there has been a finding by a jury that that is what they are, and you will find yourself inside.""*

If you watch the livestream, you can easily see that Robinson *thinks* he's found a clever way around this, by peppering his video with terms like ""alleged"" and so on. He also probably thought he was in the clear because he was standing outside a sentencing hearing rather than a trial hearing, but the case actually had two other branches of the trial still ongoing.

My guess is he was not nearly as clever as needed, and ended up once again breaching court reporting standards.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/8m8hm3/tommy_robinson_arrested_while_filming_outside/dzlx7th/,Rabdomante,1527341263

3300,"The judge told him: “On May 8, as proceedings in a rape trial were still ongoing, you attended with another and carried out filming on the court steps and inside the building.

“Both of those film pieces were then published on the Internet under a heading which read: ‘Tommy Robinson in Canterbury exposing child rapists. Police help them escape’.

“This was a deliberate action on your part to take photographs of the defendants, actions which you continued in spite of being told not to do it.

“You made it abundantly clear that your mission was to film the defendants, who you referred to by their religion, as ‘Muslim child rapists’ and ‘Muslim paedophiles’.

“I take a very dim view of your conduct which was in the face of repeated warnings.”

Robinson admitted he had come to the court to film the defendants, but was foiled by “the good offices of the court’s security staff” who had alerted the judge.

The judge said: “There are notices all over the court building making it clear that filming or taking a photograph was an offence and maybe a contempt of court.

“You were told very clearly by the security staff at this court that you were to stop filming.”

The QC asked for a prison sentence to be suspended because Yaxley-Lennon had received death threats after his association with the right-wing EDL – although he has not been a member since 2013.

3329,"This thread is a hive of misinformation and imprecision.

First, his arrest. Tommy Robinson is currently under a [3-months suspended sentence](http://www.kentonline.co.uk/canterbury/news/far-right-activist-spared-jail-126340/). He got that **not** because, as some have said, he gate-crashed a trial, but because *after* attempting to gate-crash said trial he stuck around the court building and kept taping, which is illegal in the United Kingdom, and which he had been told to stop by the court's security staff. At that point he was arrested and given a 3-months sentence (suspended for 18 months) for contempt of court.

That means that for 18 months he has to abide by certain conditions set by the court, and in return he won't have to go to prison and serve his sentence. So, what were the conditions of the suspension?

[Here](https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/coc-yaxley-lennon-20170522.pdf) (PDF) is the ruling. Those wanting the exact details of the case as well as the legal reasoning should read it all (it is in plain language, as the majority of it is a transcript of verbal proceedings), but in terms of just knowing what the conditions placed on Robinson were, we can skip to the end:

&gt; The sentence, therefore, that I pass upon you, taking into account all of those matters that have been  placed before me and your admissions entered via Mr. Kovalevsky, is one of three months' imprisonment which  will be suspended for a period of 18 months.  That will be suspended.  There will be no conditions that need to be attached to that suspended sentence, but you should be under no illusions that if you commit any further offence of any kind, and that would include, I would have thought a further contempt of court by similar actions, then that sentence of three  months would be activated, and that would be on top of anything else that you were given by any other court. 

&gt; **In short, Mr. Yaxley-Lennon, turn up at another court, refer to people as ""Muslim paedophiles, Muslim rapists"" and so on and so forth while trials are ongoing and before there has been a finding by a jury that that is what they are, and you will find yourself inside.** Do you understand?  Thank you very much.

Now, I know what portion of that will raise immediate objections: ""what, you can't even call pedophiles and rapists by their name""?

Turns out that **in some situations** no, you can't. In the UK, court proceedings are protected by the [strict liability rule](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/jul/05/contempt-court-rules-trial-media), which means that you can't use prejudicial language against defendants in criminal trials while the trial is ongoing, so as to avoid prejudicing the jury against the defendants. That applies even if your intent is not to prejudice the jury. It's to prevent trials from becoming media trials.

Think of this arrest what you will; maybe the officers had cause for it, maybe they didn't (to me it seems that he did precisely what he was told not to do, and was explained was an offense, in his previous contempt of court case). But at least you know what the legal framework for it is, instead of reading top-voted comments that allege complete nonsense without even an attempt to back it up.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/8m8hm3/tommy_robinson_arrested_while_filming_outside/dzlszil/,Rabdomante,1527333762

3490,"I'm a liar for uttering my opinion based on my own experiences? Sure buddy, keep believing that. I've talked to a lot of feminists here (granted they weren't radical feminists) and once you actually talk to them instead of simply condemning them you'd see that most do mean that the point of diversity is to have more different ideas, which simply means having a lot of different people. HOWEVER, that does often coincide with having people of different ethnicities or sexes as well, considering different groups tend to have different ideas based on their environments and experiences.  

Now where the big problem lies is with trying to enforce diversity with legislation, because often times it's difficult to force someone to hire people with different ideas. Ie you can't have a law that says ""20% of your staff must disagree with the rest"" or something like that because it's not really tangible and it's difficult to enforce it considering people change over time.  

So IMO the reason diversity is seen as so bad by many right-wingers recently is because of lazy legislation that doesn't fit what the diversity is actually there for, but many of the diversity supporters don't read much about it other than ""new bill supports diversity"" or a similar headline from their newspaper of choice.   

This doesn't mean that they *believe* it should be like that, it means they *think* it's the way they want it to be, which is not the same thing.  

As for why some may argue for that lazy legislation I firmly believe the main reason is due to stubbornness. They see the attack on the weaker parts of the diversity movement and think it's either an attack on the very concept of diversity (which it sometimes is, but not in this case) or an attack on them if they're heavily involved in identity politics. Either way they're not arguing that they believe women deserve an easier way into jobs than men or that they should be allowed to fire someone else due to some halfway-rude remark, but due to ""sticking to their guns"" and defending something that's different from what they believe in.   
 
Obviously there are exceptions, and some people do genuinely believe that, but from my experience talking to a lot of self-proclaimed feminists at a very left-leaning school as well as students and professors at the local University the sentiment is a lot more on diversity of ideas rather than diversity quotas. Call me a liar all you want, but that's the truth of my anecdotal experience and I believe it works in a similar way in most places.

As much as I'd like to support this idea, it is obviously not shared by billions of Facebook users who share photographs of their navel or their deep indignation over Trump's latest craze. 

If our privacy is more important, then why do so many feel the urge to broadcast private aspects of their lives, willingly, to hundreds or thousands of acquaintances they sometimes haven't even met?

And do the corporations who enable these behaviors actually cause more evil than the individuals who unconsciously expose themselves and the individual stalkers who abuse them?

For this reason, I think the DGPR, while an overall interesting attempt to move a step in the right direction, is ultimately useless.

What matters is public education and appropriation of the consequences of mixing digital and physical life, rather than attempts to legislate against the natural order of information flow.

You think the USA do not get any economic and political advantage from being the only superpower in the Western Hemisphere?

**If** the USA started a process of withdrawing all their bases, military personnel, and nukes from Europe, there are, generally speaking, two possible outcomes:

1) European military and political integration succeeds, and Europe becomes the world's largest superpower, eclipsing the US in the course of a few decades.

2) European military and political integration fails, and the whole of Europe goes to some degree of shit. Europe is no longer an economic and political counterweight to Russia and the Middle East.

Can you see why the USA would not want either thing to happen? For about 50 years, the UK's main role in the European Union (and its previous incarnations) was to use its veto power to slow down European political, economic, and military integration, and this was done in a very clear agreement with the USA.

*googles*

https://www.etymonline.com/word/dutch

&gt;Dutch (adj.)
&gt;
&gt;late 14c., used at first of Germans generally, after c. 1600 in the narrower sense ""Hollanders;"" from Middle Dutch duutsch, from Old High German duitisc, from Proto-Germanic *theudo ""popular, national"" (source of Modern German Deutsch), from PIE root *teuta- ""tribe"" (compare Teutonic). It corresponds to the Old English adjective þeodisc ""belonging to the people,"" which was used especially of the common language of Germanic people, a derivative of the Old English noun þeod ""people, race, nation.""
&gt;
&gt;As a language name, it is first attested as Latin theodice (786 C.E.) in correspondence between Charlemagne's court and the Pope, in reference to a synodical conference in Mercia; thus it refers to Old English. First use in reference to the German language (as opposed to a Germanic one) is two years later. The sense was extended from the language to the people who spoke it (in German, Diutisklant, ancestor of Deutschland, was in use by 13c.).
&gt;
&gt;Sense in England narrowed to ""of the Netherlands"" in 17c., after they became a united, independent state and the focus of English attention and rivalry. In Holland, Duits (formerly duitsch) is used of the people of Germany. The old use of Dutch for ""German"" continued in America (Irving and Cooper still distinguish High Dutch ""German"" and Low Dutch ""Dutch"") and survives in Pennsylvania Dutch for the descendants of religious sects that immigrated from the Rhineland and Switzerland and their language.
&gt;
&gt;Since c. 1600, Dutch (adj.) has been a ""pejorative label pinned by English speakers on almost anything they regard as inferior, irregular, or contrary to 'normal' (i.e., their own) practice"" [Rawson]. E.g. Dutch treat (1887), Dutch uncle (1838), etc. -- probably exceeded in such usage only by Indian and Irish -- reflecting first British commercial and military rivalry and later heavy German immigration to U.S.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Dutch concert, a concert in which each one sings his own song at the same time that his neighbor sings his; or a concert in which each one sings a verse of any song he pleases, some well-known chorus being sung after each verse. [Century Dictionary, 1897]

&gt;-

&gt;&gt;The Dutch themselves spoke English well enough to understand the unsavory connotations of the label and in 1934 Dutch officials were ordered by their government to stop using the term Dutch. Instead, they were to rewrite their sentences so as to employ the official The Netherlands. [Rawson]

3754,"&gt;Then you are strawmanning me.

I disagree.  To strawman would be to misrepresent someone's position.  I talked about a *portion* of your comment, and was pretty explicit that I was not aiming to rebut every bit of your comment.  Nor would that be necessary to respond.

&gt;and most likely nothing about this *will* change

Perhaps.  When the only element required is the desire to have children, not resources, it seems to be a fairly small barrier to overcome.  A social movement, a religious effort, a new wave of laws.

&gt; Immigration is probably not enough make much of a difference for us anyways. At least not at current rates

It's not yet sufficient to cause the future fall in population to stop.  The refugee crisis year was, as I recall, on the order of what would be required.  But it will slow it.

&gt;Furthermore the main reason we took in all those refugees was EU politics, helping to stabilize the economically troubled countries at our southern borders, and not naive attempts at trying to prop up our population size.

Oh, horsefeathers.

If German politicians had as their aim the simple process of politically-stabilizing the EU, the EU would very quickly start dumping people back from whence they came.  Politically, the migrant situation is a *headache*.

Germany is using what is in essence the same mechanism that the United States uses to obtain a large portion of its warm bodies from abroad today.  It knows perfectly well that the public is opposed to large-scale immigration — all publics are.  It also makes the assessment — and one which I believe to probably be correct — that immigration is in the country's interests.

And so it seizes upon a mechanism where politicians can not be held to blame, because they wrote no policy constructed explicitly to facilitate that immigration: it claims inability to do anything about illegal immigration.  Republican politicians in the US will bewail the horrible flow of illegal immigration into the US.  They will also adopt no policy that seriously attempts to end it.  Democratic politicians will complain about how illegal immigrants have no route to citizenship — and thus welfare perks — but also always *just* manage to have changing that fall off the end of their agenda.  [The current situation is quite economically-advantageous to the US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C52TlPCVDio), and neither party has any intention of changing it in the least, merely of making the *status quo* that has been established politically-viable.

German politicians will wring their hands and say that they empathize with the travails of the German public, but that there is simply nothing they can do about the flow.  But they're nobody's fools — they've an eye to the interests of their country, and the same difficult political knot to deal with that the US does.  They know damned well that the nativist crowd will cheerfully crash the country into the ground, given the option.  And they've no intention of that happening.

&gt; Some development countries have *slightly* better results than us due to various factors, including cultural ones, but nothing on a scale that would be enough to solve our problem.

I did not say that any country yet has The Ideal Solution.  I don't blame Germany for not adopting a ready-made solution sitting in front of it, because that is not what has happened. In fact, I'd say that if any country in Europe can demonstrate a *working* solution to raising fertility to sustainable levels, then Germany and other countries in Europe will probably have policymakers drop migration like a hot potato and adopt it.

What I said that I don't find it reasonable to say that it is not possible for a modern democracy to raise fertility to sustainable levels.  I don't think that it is at all reasonable to say that there is *no* route, just that one hasn't yet been found.

I don't know of a route, today, to have human level general AI.  But that is absolutely, in no way, a statement that such a thing is not possible.  In fact, I am quite confident that such a thing *is* possible.

Since you rely on old war propaganda films, how about [an article on the subject from a reputable source](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/26/weekinreview/the-not-so-neutrals-of-world-war-ii.html) instead? But let's not stop there. There's so shortage of articles if you actually care to research the topic rather than spew neo-sveko-nazi propaganda or nazi-sveko-nazi propaganda from your grandpa; makes no difference. It should give you some context and also explains some of the still existing bitterness about Sweden in the rest of the Nordic countries, and why your ""contributions"" are seen as net negative. For instance Sweden allowed the Nazis to travel freely across Sweden to invade Norway [while preventing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-British_plans_for_intervention_in_the_Winter_War) transport and other support from the Allied to Finland during the Winter War, including equipment Finland had bought from the British and some 20000 British, 20000 French and later also 50000 French troops and other aid. ^((1,2) [The 8402 Swedish volunteers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_support_of_Finland_in_the_Winter_War#Sweden) with 33 casualties you mention served non-combat positions and is nothing compared to what you prevented, and they were possibly more of a liability. Likewise, unlike Swedish propaganda, [Finnish war children evacuated to Sweden suffered more than those who stayed in Finland](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130402091136.htm).

^((1. Tanner, Väinö: ""Neuvotteluvaihe"", 1979. ISBN 951-30-4813-6. p265-267)

^((2. Tala, Henrik: ""Talvisodan ranskalaiset ratkaisijat"", 2014. ISBN 978-952-312-020-4. p165-187)

Smarter Swedes are pretty ashamed of the Swedish involvement and keep pretty quiet on the topic, because it opens quite a can of worms about the role of Sweden in WW2. Possibly even of playing overcompensated ""good guys"" as the result to the degree of provocating alt right. However, the more ignorant of the neo-nazis have recently started emerging posting old propaganda material like you do, which is maybe the source of your stuff and why you're not smart enough to keep it between yourself. Ignoring all the bad blood earlier in the history, including 650 years of occupation of Finland starting with the Swedish crusades and including countless horrors endured under the Swedish rule. So, instead of playing along with about that you did nothing by the guise of humor and letting begones be begones, you chose to bring up the topic and tearing open wounds of one of the bigger conflicts between Sweden and the rest of the Nordic countries in the 20th century.

[Here's some more](http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2017/12/18/was-sweden-really-neutral-in-world-war-two) about profiting from the war at the expense of others:

&gt; Swedish support for the Axis Powers during WW2: the iron ore trade. Germany used this ore in its weapon production, and trade form Sweden to Germany eventually became so large that ten million tons of iron ore per year was shipped to the Third Reich. The government did not interfere with the trade because of its official policy of neutrality. British intelligence had identified German dependency on this production of ore, and estimated that Germany’s preparations for war could end in disaster if there were to be a delay in exports. Therefore, the Allies planned to seize the iron ore deposits by using the Soviet attack on Finland in November 1939 as a cover. They planned to gain Norwegian (the ore was shipped through harbors in Norway to reach Germany) and Swedish permission to send expeditionary forces to Finland, under the pretense of helping the Finnish, and once there, they would take control of the northern cities to gain access to the ore and deny German access to it. ... Germans asked the Swedes to allow German armed forces to be transported by train through Swedish land, from Norway to Finland... in the end permission was granted to Germany. Sweden ignored the greater moral issues of the war and played both sides for profit.

[Here's some more](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/murky-truth-of-how-a-neutral-sweden-covered-up-its-collaboration-with-nazis-5372299.html) about aiding Germany in the Holocaust:

&gt; Swedes have long enjoyed the illusion of innocence, of freedom from Nazi-related guilt, but now, amid a welter of revelations, the country is slowly coming to terms with an historical truth that is more complicated than the idealistic neutrality thought to have been maintained throughout the Second World War.

&gt; What has particularly shocked and disgusted many people in the run-up to the Stockholm conference on the Holocaust is a television documentary exposing how several hundred Swedish soldiers volunteered to fight on the German side during the war. Some worked as guards at Treblinka, the concentration camp where 900,000 Jews were murdered.

&gt; Sweden also enjoyed the profits of doing business with the Nazis. It is emerging now that some of the gold handled by its central bank, the Riksbank, had been looted from Jews by the German Nazis. There was evidence at the time that the gold was plundered but both the management of the Riksbank and the government turned a blind eye. Unclaimed accounts in Swedish banks at the end of the war were also handled ineptly.

&gt; Nevertheless, Swedes have begun to look at their past from a new perspective. The morality of neutrality is being seriously questioned. At the same time, the Swedish neo-Nazi movement is growing stronger. Prompted by the activities of these groups and the fact that a recent survey showed that some schoolchildren had never heard of the Holocaust, the government has launched an education programme.

-------
And similar from an article of dailymail not linked for technical reasons:

&gt; Swedish finance minister in wartime, Ernst Wigforss, approved bank credits to Berlin in 1941. The loans served to increase Swedish exports to Nazi Germany, allowing it to prosecute its war on all fronts.

&gt; The result of the approval of the bank credits meant that Sweden avoided demands from Germany for direct Swedish state aid and that Swedish boat yards could continue to build vessels for Nazi Germany's navy.

-------
And more from another article of the same source.

&gt; Sweden aided the Nazis during WW2 as their neighbours fought and lost a decisive battle against the German invaders. Sweden stayed neutral in the war but Norway was among the first conquests of Hitler.

&gt; Sweden let the Germans use its efficient rail network to transport men and materials to the battle of Narvik, where British troops were deployed in a bid to stave off the Nazi hordes. The Germans used the Swedish rail network on a large scale during the fighting. The operation was much more extensive than historians have previously realised.

&gt; Once the permission was given Germany sent in combat troops disguised as medical personnel. For every actual medical officer or orderly, the trains carried 17 infantrymen. In addition, the trains carried heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns, ammo and a plethora of communications and supply equipment.

&gt; Once the swastika flew over Narvik, Sweden allowed German trains to run to the port - taking Swedish iron ore back to Germany, where it was used to fuel the war machine. Sweden's railway network was used extensively to aid the German occupation of Norway. This included sending Norwegians to Germany, many of them bound for concentration camps.

3785,"&gt;We have not invaded because they do not have nukes. 

We also haven't invaded them because they would be fucking impossible to invade. The whole idea that we can drop a couple of bombs and the regime for collapse is highly questionable at best. The fact is, if they decide to break out for nukes  

&gt; Trump wants to use economic and political pressure to block them but the EU seems to think it is a good idea to make more extreme measures necessary.  They do not have a strong enough economy to afford the R &amp; D to do it themselves so they have their limitations. 

See thats funny, you have it reversed. The Iranians were not building nukes before this. They might decide to build nukes though because its pretty clear at this point that if they dont build nukes its people like you who think they can be invaded just like that and need to be overthown at all costs, as shown in your next paragraph. 

&gt; As for it's military, Iran decided during the Cold War to no longer rely on outside countries to sell them top equipment as needed.  

  Lets look at the [Millennium Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Challenge_2002), when the US got its ass kicked by Iran in a simulation so badly they they had to script the entire thing so they could say America could win.  So yeah, we would get our asses kicked in a war. 

&gt; They are also the only Persian country in an area where most countries are Arab so that further isolates them 

That wont matter for shit. All they have to do is defend their coast for about a year, which wont be that hard to do, given the simulations, and build the nuclear bomb underground in their mountain ranges. Maybe the US will win, but this will cost lives in the hundreds of thousands only triggered because the US wanted to go to war with Iran. The inspection regime is currently working. 

&gt;  There would be serious challenges but the bottom line is they have been pledging death to America for generations and exporting Islamic terror so they have to be stopped. 

War with Iran will make Iraq look like a cakewalk. We will have to pull troops from other areas, like Korea. And guess what North Korea might do then, oh wait, attack the South. America can win in Iran, but it will cost us elsewhere. No Pentagon plan has really tried to factor in an invasion of Iran, just bombing nuclear sites, that is how unrealistic it is. 

&gt; Also, Iraq just did vote for a very nationalistic leader. 

He got 16&amp;#37; of the seats, and that was while being in alliance with the communist party. Hardly a sweep. 

&gt; I hope that economic and political pressure is enough but if the EU or some other organization blocks that so be it.

Even if that was true you are just adressing the least important part of my comment. For the forseeable future there is no realistic way for Germany to be ""much more"" than it is now aside from being an important part of whatever the EU is going to become. And that is certainly not because of Merkel's alleged incompetence. And while I am not in the mood to calculate this for you now I am pretty sure younger generations would have to make ridiculous amounts of children to counteract this ""greying problem"" sufficiently to make a big difference. It is imo extremely unlikely that enough people here will actually choose to do something like that to themselves.

Evolution works slowly and does not stop. Humans are not perfectly adapted evolutionary to our current self-made environments and the sociopolitical and economical developments leading to lower birth-rates in developed countries are of a virtually impersonal nature and basically outside of the control of politicians in modern democracies. Furthermore as far as the matter of natural selection is concerned afaik researchers would consider you successful evolutionarily if you have one descendent that also has offspring. This condition can be fulfilled for the majority of people even if the population is shrinking. Reproductive strategies that cause humans to have lots of offspring are btw a response to volatile etc etc environments. Such environments are not given here in Germany, and if they were, we as individual citizens would have more pressing issues than our relative reduction in global impact as a nation being slightly accelerated by the steady increase of our population's average age.",,/r/europe/comments/8m56tx/saudi_crown_prince_mohammed_bin_salman_has/dzlajm4/,Mr-X1,1527300081

I didn't take issue with your comment as a whole, but with that specific bit.

&gt; basically outside of the control of politicians in modern democracies.

That's quite a strong statement to make.  Merkel's own efforts just a few years ago were aimed at the fertility rate, not immigration.  There are countries in Europe which aim at adjusting the fertility rate now.

It seems to me that to confidently make such a claim, one must assert, firstly, that either Merkel was wrong or consensus has been established that this is an impossibility otherwise in the past handful of years.  One also asserts that one is more aware of what is possible and impossible than other countries who make efforts along such lines.

I'll believe that one has grounds to say that it is not trivial, as I did, or that it is harder than expected.  I question whether PiS will meet their stated goals.  However, to say that it is outside the grasp of politicians in ""modern democracies"", unless you are slipping quite restrictive conditions into that phrase, seems like an unreasonably broad and strong claim to me.

Look if the *militaries* are face to face and there's no **sudden random invasion for no reason!!** then there is literally no scenario where it occurs.

&gt;So you think the US would let a shoot down and 200 dead sme Ivan civilians by an Iranian military unit just slide?

Like any of the other incidents, there would be a lot of diplomatic pressure and not a random fucking invasion, let alone military action.

You are welcome to cite examples if you think that any state would respond that way.

&gt;Also, did you just tey discredit the knowledge of pilots about air law, rules and regulations? It's kind of our job. Or are you for the interpretation that the military should be judge, jury and executioner, with no accountability.

None of that has any relevance to a state of conflict, which is what was ongoing in the Persian Gulf.

2) They are not promising to deport everyone, only the illegal ones.

EDIT:

3) Their estimate, [on page 27 here (in Italian)](https://www.quotidiano.net/polopoly_fs/1.3919629.1526651257!/menu/standard/file/contratto_governo.pdf), is that there is a total of 500k illegal immigrants in Italy right now. So they are promising to deport all of them in the course of five years.

It's remarkable how you've accused me of not being from Europe, accused me of not understanding cultural differences and accused me of now understanding reality without countering anything I've said thus far.

&gt; In all likelihood the only impact will be a minor hit to margins.

To the big companies, I agree, they won't be impacted too much by these changes. But for smaller companies or startups, especially those operating in the EU, the GDPR could make it much harder for them and hamper their competitiveness.

&gt; It is not the collection of data that bothers people. It is the lack of oversight as to how that data is used

Most companies state who they store, share and process that data and allow you to opt-out of certain aspects already.

&gt; Many of these services are ubiquitous and therefore not an optional extra if you wish to fully engage in modern society.

Such as?

&gt; As such it is easy to argue that companies are abusing their position

Well, which company is abusing their position? You can point to Facebook, but the fact of the matter is they do not have a monopoly on anything, there are a plethora of other services you could use to get news or keep in touch with friends and family; specific features and layout may vary, but the core concept is not one Facebook posses a monopoly on.

&gt; I am happy to have enhanced rights as a citizen

OK, good.

&gt; I find it odd that anyone would be opposed to that.

See, this is the fundamental issue, without reading my points and processing them, you automatically assume that because I'm critical (note, not anti-GDPR), but because I'm critical of the GDPR, you automatically assume I'm anti-regulation, opposed to rights for citizens and I don't understand differences in culture or reality, all are untrue.

4269,"&gt;If you have any kind of customer data, even just for billing, you have to adhere to the GDPR

If you're adhering to the GDPR then you don't need consent to use data given consensually to you for the purposes it was given to you. This is one of the most basic concepts of the legislation. It's only processing personal data for purposes other than what it was collected for that require additional consents.

&gt;""The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected. In such a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal data is required""

Someone giving you their address so you can bill them is already considered consent to use that personal information for that purpose. You only need additional consent if you want to do something else with that data.


&gt;Even a non profit sports club will have to get a signed consent form from each member

Signed consent for what? Also, no, consent doesn't need to be written, it just has to be a ""clear affirmative act"".

&gt;""Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, **or an oral statement**""

If the owners of that club decided to take a photo of everyone who entered the club then yes they would need consent or a legitimate reason to do so without consent (i.e. security camera footage). They can't start amassing photos of members without consent for no good reason.

It is rarely difficult for companies that properly handle data to comply anyway as most of the requirements should already be in place or relatively trivial to implement and there's been two years to comply now.

4344,"The EU isn't responsible either. The most damning thing you could say is that Schengen made movement of illegals and refugees easy so they could go welfare-shopping but that's not what Schengen is for. The blame lies with the border countries who kept accepting illegal migrants and then fobbing them off to their actual destinations. Then the Turkey deal closed one route and after Italy couldn't just send its immigrants north anymore, they made a deal with Libya to process asylum-seekers there along with smacking down the NGOs, closing another route. 

What's being done in Germany now is what should have been done from 2015 - every asylum-seeker gets to sit tight in a processing center instead of getting gibs or a job, until their claim checks out. Except it should have been done in S. Europe and N. Africa with EU funds, instead of that abortion of a redistribution scheme. I'd say hindsight is 20/20 but I was saying the same things years ago and I wasn't the only one. Maybe the political climate just wasn't there yet to build camps to concentrate people in for processing. But sure enough, we're at that point now after a lot of turmoil, along with paying warlords and their militias to keep people in Libya.

&gt;Why, exactly, is it of such critical importance to the political left to have uncontrolled migration from 3rd world shit holes into countries that are more affluent?

I think only extreme anarchist no-borders types think like that. I'd say for most, it was a matter of ''helping these poor people''. Thing is, many of these ''poor people'' are just that.

4347,"&gt; Caesar tried to basically become a king again and everyone was like ""nah"" and shanked tf out of him.

That’s not a proper description of what happened. For the Romans even
in imperial times, “king” (*rex*, *tyrannus*) was synonymous with political
barbarism.
When Iulius Caesar made his way to the top of the Republic he carefully
avoided any allusions to kingship. In fact, his supporters were the *populares*:
the “lower classes” or “popular majority” if you allow misappropriating a modern
term, whose interests did not align at all with monarchy. Caesar happily stuck
with the republican rank of *dictator* at the high point of his influence; his
hereditary monarchical successors favored the military title of *imperator*.

His opponents, the *optimates* (“best party” in the non-Gnarr sense), represented
the borderline gerontocracy of the Republic. After the Ides of March, they and many
of Caesars former supporters appealed to Cicero to restore the old political system
of which he personified – despite Cicero not being involved in nor informed about
the plot.",Laurasia,/r/europe/comments/8ligkj/what_do_you_know_about_the_roman_empire/dzk9jlc/,the_gnarts,1527262000

If you want your officers to be able to defend themselves in case they get into a physical confrontation, a minimum height is warranted. Obviously the height itself will be arbitrary as there is no clear cut of point, but would the police employ a midget as a extreme example for field duty?

Many of the physical disabilities will exclude people from working for, are if we are 100% honest discriminating against that group. But nobody would argue that we now go for diversity in throw them into a police interceptor and task them to apprehend subjects. 

That doesn't mean we shouldn't try to accommodate that group in some way to serve in the police forces, but field work is excluded for them.

Even more apparent is this for firefighters, as they are nearly entirely working the field, a midget, somebody in a wheelchair, people with glass bones and X other things are nearly entirely useless in those cases.

But not because of their disabilities, but because their physical attributes do not match what is required of them in the field. And the limits of what is acceptable when it comes to physical attributes, should not be based on sex, gender, race or anything.

4409,"Sad, it's a nice country with great people. I was there last when it was in the middle of huge inflation. I was told to imagine a few extra zeros on the lira I was given. They were no longer bothering to print new ones. Erdogan did some great work pulling the country out of what was essentially a military dictatorship after a crippling economic crisis. However, since he basically appointed himself as dictator for life after exceeding his normal democratic welcome of a couple of genuinely successful terms, things have spiraled out of control for Turkey and the Turks. He's the living proof of why term limits are a good thing. 

He could have retired after a job well done and live out his days as one of the most successful modern Turkish leaders the country has had.  Instead, he is at this point very much part of the problem and not the solution. Given his efforts to centralize power, there's really no-one else to blame either. Turkey is experiencing chilled relations with Europe, one of its main trading partners because of him. Years of haggling over human rights, the recent incarnation of opposition leaders, military crackdown on the Kurds, and staged so-called coup, all of that had Erdogan at the center. The fix is both obvious and easy: don't vote for the man again. Instead find somebody who is not an autocratic populist that can restore Turkey's damaged diplomatic relations, revive tourism and trade, and reboot the economy. 

For any Turks reading this, just look across your direct borders for examples of how not to run a country. You have bankrupt Greece, isolated Iran, war torn Syria, and not too far away the former world power of Russia.

&gt; if a company is misusing user data out of incompetence then they need to learn their lesson.

This is a absolutely true, knowing that they will receive a reprimande for their incompetence before fines strengthens that argument.

&gt; The problem isn't the GDPR - it's the companies who, until now, got away with mishandling your personal data.

The problem certainly isn't with the GDPR, my concerns were that some companies could get punished without acting in ill intent, whereas other companies may be able to narrowly navigate through legislation to continue abusing user data.

4714,"To clarify, Im actually not blaming the US of a malicious shoot down, because I do not believe that there was any malicious intent, or deliberate will to attack an airliner. I am blaming the US military for poor training, poor rules or engagement, and a failure to apply proper disciplinary action after the accident. The US military is in no regard unique in protecting its own - it just happened to be them in this case.


The other cases are valid for your argument, however somewhat beside the point. Is Korea capable of attacking the USSR over the shoot down? Would the US intervene on their behalf? Of course not. What would have happened if the T&amp;G aircraft was a passenger airliner with cca 200 people on board. Can you honestly say that the US government would shrug it off, and that there would not be a public outcry for justice? 


Imagine a case where a Ukrainian unit shoots down an Aeroflot flight, or an Iranian battery shoots down a US Airways flight? There would be hell to pay.

4906,"The marshalling yards in Dresden are 2km from the city centre, and Allied bombers didn't focus their attack there anyway. The first bombs were purposefully dropped on an open field and then the fires were fanned eastward towards the Altstadt and Pirnaischer Vorstadt/Johannstadt. [Blockbuster bombs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_bomb) were dropped periodically to provide air for the firestorm and allow it to 'leap' from point to point (i.e. lots of smaller fires would link up with the main firestorm and rapidly bolster its size). By the time the firestorm reached the aforementioned districts it was catastrophic enough to wipe out essentially all building stock. 

&gt;The standard whitewash gambit, both British and American, is to mention that Dresden contained targets X, Y and Z, and to let the innocent reader assume that these targets were attacked, whereas in fact the bombing plan totally omitted them and thus, except for one or two mere accidents, they escaped. 


– Alexander McKee, historian

It's important to note with this that the important Autobahn bridge to the west of the city was not targeted or attacked and that no railway stations were on the British target maps, nor were the bridges, such as the railway bridge spanning the Elbe River. The city's barracks were also not attacked, ironically only sustaining damage because bombers missed their primary targets south of the Elbe (i.e. the Altstadt).",,/r/europe/comments/8lqk50/dresden_germany/dzjggog/,Viva_Straya,1527218818

4940,"Let's start with Alexander McKee, he mostly wrote and learned his trade way before the details of Ultra was revealed to the public. There had been some 40 years of the Brits not saying exactly what they targeted in Dresden or why due to that secrecy. 


The reason for the bombing of Dresden was to destroy it as a logistical point and prevent Germany from moving forces to shore up defenses in northern Germany against the Soviets. It was a strike against logistics with the intention of hampering Germans ability to effectively defend them and counter any movements made by the Allies, in particular the Soviets. 


We got that clear? Good. You can find more about the actual decision to bomb the city (Which is kinda key here) in Dresden: Tuseday 13th February, 1945. It is from 2006. You can find much info there. 



As to the ""why no target bridges?"" or ""why not bomb just the marshaling yards and not level the place?"" Like do you understand exactly how difficult bombing at this time was? You do realize that people on several occasions managed to build and maintain bridges over major European rivers whilst at the same time being under air-attacks by much more accurate things like dive-bombers? 



You do realize that they tried bombing Chemnitz on the 14th and 15th of February, a city which in fairness was only half as big as Dresden, but still 717 RAF bombers managed to miss the entire city? 


Area bombing was used as it was the only thing that could be used for an effective strike. Was it shitty? Yes. Did Helmut age 7 and Helga age 74 deserve to burn to death? No. Were their deaths a tragedy? Yes, yes it was. 



But they became tragic victims in a war their government started, the bombings could easily have been stopped if the Nazis weren't so hell bent on fighting until the bitter end. The Allied leadership saw an opportunity to do something that whilst horrible, had become commonplace and that they genuine believed (and most likely did) shorten the war considerably. This meant less dead Allied soldiers on the fields of Europe, less dead in camps and on death marches. 



What impact would those 42 divisions the Germans had planned to move into Europe had on the length of the War? Their ability to move forces and mount further offensives or send their troops to were they needed to be? (Instead of sitting in some far of place or in western Germany and surrendering peacefully when the day came)

Click on the ""manage"" link of the first bullet point. You might have to log in at this point, I've no idea how I got it to do what I wanted.

Choose ""manage options"", then again, click the ""manage"" link. Now you should be at the page OP is.

The link from the app is utter shit and leads nowhere sane imo. The normal tumblr website wasn't of more help. Hope this gets you right though. If this for some reason doesn't work my advise is to log in on tumblr, find the link to the site and then open the link above or click your way there.

You do this by clicking the menu button, choose Privacy Center, then Relevant Advertising. This leads to the same page as the above linked one. I also had the option of deselect all, might be a phone thing though.

What is thought to have happened was that due to the smoke cover from the earlier RAF raids, radar-based blind-bombing was used with the city centre as the guidepost. This meant that the target area was larger and the bombs more dispersed, but also that the bombs would overshoot targets into the city centre more often than not. The RAF by contrast had a clear target marked by pathfinders and the raid was designed on the principles of maximal urban damage and overwhelming its municipal responses. It was the British raids that yielded the larger death and destruction, the USAAF added to the destruction marginally. Now this is a bit simplistic, but it benefits from the quality of being generally true while brief. I do think that there was some convergence of doctrines involved, the USAAF was converging to the RAF spirit of area bombing, and some of the future logic of pretext bombing of the type we would see in North Korea, but discussing these things in particular examples typically involves much more work than I'm willing to devote to Reddit.",Planetary Union,/r/europe/comments/8lqk50/dresden_germany/dzjksdy/,ingenvector,1527224243

I'm not an apologize-for-America kind of guy."" The quote, although unrelated to the downing of the Iranian air liner, has been attributed as such.

**In February 1996, the United States agreed to pay Iran US$131.8 million in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice relating to this incident, together with other earlier claims before the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal. US$61.8 million of the claim was in compensation for the 248 Iranians killed in the shoot-down: $300,000 per wage-earning victim and $150,000 per non-wage-earner.**

    &gt;I am saddened to report that it appears that in a proper defensive action by the U.S.S. Vincennes this morning in the Persian Gulf an Iranian airliner was shot down over the Strait of Hormuz. This is a terrible human tragedy. Our sympathy and condolences go out to the passengers, crew, and their families. The Defense Department will conduct a full investigation.

    &gt;We deeply regret any loss of life. The course of the Iranian civilian airliner was such that it was headed directly for the U.S.S. Vincennes, which was at the time engaged with five Iranian Boghammar boats that had attacked our forces. When the aircraft failed to heed repeated warnings, the Vincennes followed standing orders and widely publicized procedures, firing to protect itself against possible attack.

    &gt;The only U.S. interest in the Persian Gulf is peace, and this tragedy reinforces the need to achieve that goal with all possible speed.

It's kinda two-bit, in my opinion... An apology admits wrongdoing, and his statement does not. 

Furthermore, the government lied about the fact that the ship was in Iranian waters at the time and that it was headed towards the Vincennes.

&gt;I encourage all of you, if you have symptoms that last more than a week, to get over the embarrassment and go and see a doctor. Colonoscopy is nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be, in the US (at least at my specialist) they knock you out for it entirely so you don't feel a thing. Doctors are professionals, they have heard everything 1000 times before, they are impossible to embarrass. Do not suffer in silence, get screened.

5088,"Given that we tax our fuel way less than Europe, Europe should arguably have a ton more highway funding and wider roads than the US does.

https://taxfoundation.org/how-high-are-other-nations-gas-taxes/

&gt;The U.S. federal government funds infrastructure projects through the highway trust fund. This trust fund receives revenue from mainly the excise tax on gasoline, and uses the revenue to pay for transportation projects through grants to state and local governments.
&gt;
&gt; The taxes and spending associated with the highway trust fund are based on the benefit principle of taxation, which states that what one pays to the government should be connected to the benefits one receives.
&gt;
&gt;Currently, the federal government levies a $0.184 per gallon tax on gasoline. In addition, state and local governments levy an average gas tax per gallon of about $0.35. This is an average combined rate of about $0.53 a gallon.
&gt;
&gt;The U.S. combined gas tax rate is actually a lot lower than rates in other industrialized countries. According to data from the OECD, the average gas tax rate among the 34 advanced economies is $2.62 per gallon. In fact, the U.S.’s gas tax is the second lowest (Mexico is the only country without a gas tax) and has a rate less than half of that of the next highest country, Canada, which has a rate of $1.25 per gallon.
&gt;
&gt;On top of excise taxes, all OECD countries levy their value added tax (VAT) on gasoline consumption. In the United States, only a few states (Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan) levy an additional sales tax on gasoline purchases. This means that the difference between taxes paid on gasoline in the United States and other OECD countries is even larger than the data on just excise taxes implies.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8ltmfm/german_regulator_orders_recall_of_daimler_diesel/dzjdz3u/,vokegaf,1527216036

[Expectation of Life in Medieval England](https://books.google.com/books?id=T4DLK7zLxYMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)

Life expectancy for the English aristocracy at age 21:

* 1200–1300: to age 64
* 1300–1400: to age 45 (because of the bubonic plague)
* 1400–1500: to age 69
* 1500–1550: to age 71

Compare that to life expectancy for the UK now (81.2 years). And that's for everyone, not just aristocracy. Life expectancy for the peasants was obviously lower.

And of course, life for the modern day equivalent of aristocrats (the incredibly wealthy) is higher too. In the US, [the top 1% of men average living to 88 and women average 91](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/18/the-government-is-spending-more-to-help-rich-seniors-than-poor-ones/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.74bb865c606f).

The same service would be just fine if it was run by somebody outside EU (by blocking all EU users of course and deleting their data).

&gt; Having said that, the Czech example is concerning and exactly what we will see more of with GDPR, in my opinion. It's a gift to the tech giants and crippling to the tech startups.

IMO this point is greatly underestimated. Europe is already falling behind USA regarding to innovation and now GDPR basically establishes additional entry barriers in tech industry.

5223,"After reading this conversation I would like to note a few things. To have a von in your Name does not necessarily mean that it's an aristocratic. In northern Germany you can regularly see people with a von in their name that were never aristocratics. Even if your family are aristocratics that does not necessarily mean that you're rich. In the GDR the aristocratics had no land or wealth left after WW2 let alone the many Prussian aristocratics that fled.

Many of these families live a very regular life and may have had a better start after WW2 because of higher education and maybe relatives with a bit of money left but not more. My grandmothers Family is for example a low level aristocratic family from the former eastern Prussia and they lost everything after the war and the only difference to the rest of the refugees was that they took two pigs with them that were eaten along the way. They also had nothing, came with 15 people and lived  in the house of my fathers family. Stories like that are very common among the lower aristocratics all over Germany.

The people who kept their titles as a part of their names are usually from ruling families. They're probably indeed still rich because of their families history, but the majority of people with a von on their name are not. Germany also had a lot of very mighty higher aristocratics because of our patchwork history when it came to countries within the Holy Roman Empire and the Imperial Germany and Austria-Hungary later on.

5226,"&gt;I recently listened to a Dan Carlin podcast about 'perfect' democracy in the distant future, where a scientist brought up an idea that's been circulating about automated voting. Where rather than letting people vote for whomever they want, they type in their beliefs into a form about certain things which creates your voting profile, and with super intelligence from the future it works through all the factors to determine which vote would most likely result in a government that works towards the things that align with your beliefs, not who says they will or works behind the curtains to make you believe it will. It's less than theory but it illustrates a lot of the problems about voting.

When the aircraft failed to heed repeated warnings, the Vincennes followed standing orders and widely publicized procedures, firing to protect itself against possible attack.

5291,"&gt; Estonia president decided to start russophobic tirade regarding how he fucking hate Russia. Can you blame russians and Russia for being disappointed in West?

So Russia is OK keeping Ukraine on leash and partly occupied because some Estonian dude wasn't being polite?

&gt; The thing is that you believe that you need to go to someones sphere of influence. The most profitable part is being neutral. Finland was neutral and profited from both USSR and US. Ukraine could've been also neutral and even more at the best spot available

I think that small and weak countries rightly feel that they should be part of a security alliance when their neighbor is 100x of their size and military prowress, and has an incredibly thin skin when it comes to offence. Estonia or Ukraine could take nothing from the Russians, Russia is the World's largest country, and has by far the largest military besides the US.

How interesting that countries in Europe, despite their difficult histories, can live side by side in their small, dense countries, while Russia just have to have large buffer zones made up of layers of whole other countries whose cumulative population is 2-3x that of Russia's? Shouldn't nations decide for their own? Why is it always Russia who doesn't play ball and just needs to dominate more, even though it's already _the_ giant in Eurasia? I wish for the Russian people to reach the level of at least Poland, Russia could do it if it wanted to, it could have associated EU and NATO membership, trade, everything. Even if it receives no cohesion funds from the EU, it sure has vast amounts of oil money and foreign investment opportunities to finance a transition from a Stalinist type monoculture to something that resembles other countries in Europe. Russia's real competition and possible adversary is not Europe or the West, but China. If anything, Russia needs allies and friends. Look at what Russia did with the Ukrainian occupations? In case of a conflict, Ukraine would be a preeminent, willing NATO partner, because Russian acts alienated them.

Regarding the holy grail of neutrality: Finland, Austria became neutral after WW2 out of necessity. The great powers agreed on this. They had the opportunity to arbitrage between East and West, and their leadership did a fine job convincing their populations that neutrality is some kind of a virtue. But let's not kid ourselves. These countries knew which side they were on in case of a conflict, and they were specific, since published plans to do so. NATO also had (and have?) plans to cover these countries, not from altruism but from strategic positioning. Also, the East-West arbitrage only makes sense as long as few countries do it, but the entire Eastern Europe wouldn't be able to gain on this. Russia's acts make more and more Finnish and Swedish folks think that maybe NATO wouldn't such a bad thing after all, quite an achievement post the Cold War :-)",,/r/europe/comments/8lrbto/a_missile_fired_at_flight_mh17_in_2014_killing/dzixeir/,monfera,1527197997

5352,"&gt; I live on the Swedish west coast, my family (Father and uncle, if we're going to be specific) has owned an acclaimed gourmet restaurant for nearly twenty years.

I live in a country where fresh fish are available in restaurants and city markets in a daily basis and where there's also frozen fish in the traditional supermarkets. There's no comparison, whatsoever. Thousands of tourists every year, from north to south, praises the fresh fish they can eat here and not in their countries. 

Sometimes I have to prepare some frozen fish at home, due to tight schedules and it's just not the same. Not the texture and not the taste, for sure.

&gt; does a filé of salmon that has been frozen for two months taste differently when panfried, compared to one that was caught in the morning 8 hours ago?

Yeah, panfried with the use of vegetable oil and stuff might hide the obvious differences between fresh and frozen fish, due to how agressive that type of cooking is, ""destroying"" the fish. For more ""soft"" methods, like boiling, steaming, marinating etc., the difference is evident.

It's pretty much the same with meat.

What is worse about modern appartment complexes (especially the ones built after 2010), at least in Romania, is that most of them (not all, there are exceptions) are built with no regard for livability.

There is no parking, no green spaces, no playgrounds, some of them aren't even properly connected to electricity and running water, because of how greedy the developers are.

They buy land at the outskirts of the cities and just build as many apartments as they can, to get as much money as possible. ",Romania,/r/europe/comments/8lsmmg/in_poland_we_had_block_chain_before_cryptocurrency/dzi8g02/,bobama123,1527175203

5510,"Exactly. It’s absolutely unprecedented for one nation to have this much concentrated military might, and not use it to acquire as much land and resources as possible. Instead we use it to help protect nations that can’t protect themselves, we use it to help set up governments that are democratic and have a chance at taking care of their residents in the future, we bring aid into disaster zones and we do our best to prevent and de escalate conflict around the globe via soft power the state department wields. (Historically we did at least. This administration doesn’t quite get it). 

People/countries would get on us about being the world police but never stopped to think about what would happen if we listened and backed off. Now we are starting to see it and the population began agreeing that we shouldn’t help other countries. Something being “the right thing to do” is no longer enough for a large swathe of the country. 

Americans need to realize that we are a global stabilizing force and presence in the world and just come to terms with the fact that it’s in everyone’s best interests to continue our efforts abroad. We need to just accept that when you’re in charge you get a lot of the grief from everyone around you because everyone will always have an opinion about how you’re doing it wrong. It’s the same thing as when we all go to work. The bosses and decision makers catch flak from everyone. We just need to take the input of other countries into consideration and do our best to keep moving forward. 

Also the people that complain about the budget the military gets have a point, we could do better managing the check book, but they need to vote in people who can actually do it. That’s on Congress.

5533,"It’s not craziness, it’s plain fact. Religion is the frame that was used to build the modern world. Modern culture was built on the traditions of our father’s and theirs before them. That’s true across the globe. The modern world looks the way it does because of the beliefs and actions of the people before us, and ancient people were deeply religious. Even simple things about modern culture are rooted in religion. Music, for example, can be a VERY religious experience for humans. Art, and architecture are two other aspects of life that are deeply, deeply religious. A lot of the world’s legal systems that you praise in your comment are rooted in religious values as well. Why do we refrain from murder? If you refrain from murder simply because your legal system says it’s wrong, then you’re refraining for the wrong reason. You’re meant refrain from murder because it’s morally wrong, and we learned that it was morally wrong from the religion of our ancestors. Again, that goes for the world over. Reject the religious teachings of the people before you, and you’ll find that there’s no substance or meaning to living life at all. The Bible is a masterpiece of literature from multiple perspectives, but particularly from a psychological perspective. There’s so many verses that are essentially hyperlinked to not only other passages in the Bible itself, but many many other religious texts. Further than that, they’re echoed in our lives everyday, to this day. How could The Bible be SO applicable to modern life if what’s inside it wasn’t inherently true? Keep in mind that what I’m saying is accepted from hardcore religious people, to atheists. The Bible is Psychologically correct. To hate somebody doesn’t necessarily mean that you would do them physical harm, but to assume that no one would do physical harm because there are laws isn’t wise. Human kind is capable of some absolute atrocities, and all you have to do to see that as absolutely true is read a history text book. Next time you get into a particularly heated argument with someone you love, take a moment to search the very back of your mind and you’ll find some things that even you wouldn’t believe are in there. You have to realize that you’re capable of the very same atrocities as some of the worst humans to have lived. Most people assume that if they were alive at the time of World War 2, and they lived in Germany, that they’d somehow be the hero that hid Jews in their home. The reality most likely is that you’d be one of the guards at auschwitz torturing and killing the Jews. If we as a society keep that in mind, then we’ll be much more cautious with statements advocating for hate. Carl Jung said that we had to wake up, because we’re too technologically advanced to be as morally asleep as we are.

- Sunday is the only day the government says you can't be forced to work upon; tough luck for the Judaists and Muslims and all the others who have their free day on another day eh.
- The anthem references God copiously

There is so much more than that which makes it clear the government takes a side and advances the religion of Protestantism above all others.

&gt; I'd agree with you that there's a lot of nuance missing during high school. Unfortunately, that's the case in every subject - you're being taught models, and the limits of those models are hardly mentioned.

Yeah, in this case the lack of nuance just conveniently comes down to glorifying the Netherlands and the state and painting it like a pretty picture that it isn't.

And meanwhile they do have time to point out how in other countries there is supposedly no freedom of opinion; if they can do it about those they can do it about the Netherlands but they don't and that's by design to breed little patriots; the curriculum is decided by the state and it happens to glorify the state.

&gt; That's not to say that the Dutch state is either secular or religious. Rather, I'd argue that you cannot use such a binary classification if you want to be completely accurate. For most dealings with the state, however, assuming it to adhere to the secular model is pretty accurate though.

It's all a matter of degrees but _they_ came with a binary model at school and insisted that all religions are equal in the Netherlands which is bullshit. Together with all sorts of other lofty ideals like:

- freedom of opinion
- equality of the sexes ad races
- equality before the law
- nation of laws
- independent judiciary
- powerless ceremonial monarch

All these things are a *lie*—they don't exist; you live in a country where the then prince consort accepted bribes and was held out of prison because the monarch—his spouse—ordered it so and protected him; later on this same person managed to give an illegal order to bug the house of a political enemy of his; an order _no one_ should be able to give on paper and certainly not he but he managed to give it anyway because he has so many friends in high places that people know disobeying him would be disastrous for their career and put them on a blacklist so they obliged; all these things are known to everyone and he was never investigated or prosecuted for it because he had enough friends in high places to keep him out; there is no ""equality for the law"". You can shoot a man in the face at broad daylight if you have enough friends in high places and they will keep you out of prison.",,/r/europe/comments/8lme6t/mhmmm/dzi8ysr/,geile_zwarte_kousen,1527175675

Yeah no, that’s just stupid:

&gt; Czesław Miłosz describes the debate as **an ""absurd"" projection of a modern understanding of nationality onto Renaissance people, who identified with their home territories rather than with a nation.**

[...]

&gt;Similarly, historian Norman Davies writes that Copernicus, as was common in his era, was ""largely indifferent"" to nationality, being a **local patriot who considered himself ""Prussian"".**

[...]

&gt;Miłosz and Davies both write that Copernicus had a German-language cultural background, while his **working language was Latin** in accord with the usage of the time.[153][154] Additionally, according to Davies, ""there is ample evidence that he knew the Polish language"".

[...]

&gt;Davies concludes that, ""Taking everything into consideration, **there is good reason to regard him both as a German and as a Pole: and yet, in the sense that modern nationalists understand it, he was neither.""**

He was neither Polish nor German.

It all depends on what technology you have available.

In the MH17 case, the BUK launcher was just one vehicle (so-called TELAR), operating without the rest of the system (radars, communication equipment, command vehicles etc).

A BUK TELAR vehicle has its own small radar so it can operate on its own, but in that case its capacity to identify targets is severely limited.",Montenegro,/r/europe/comments/8lrbto/a_missile_fired_at_flight_mh17_in_2014_killing/dzi8zib/,Glideer,1527175693

Excellent!  Now if we can just find the other one we'll all be here!

&gt;The way it stands it feels fundamentally broken - not just because over half the country feels disenfranchised whoever wins, but because of the long-term polarising effect, and the lurching of policy from one extreme to another.

I'm halfway with you here.  The polarisation and disenfranchisement is definitely the major underlying problem.  However, I think this is a construct of the new tribalism more than a reflection of actual extreme policy changes.  In the UK, as in the US, there has been an increasing rhetorical escalation as each side paints the other as what it is not.  But the reality, in the UK but *not* the US, is that the actual policy swings are small but are painted as huge.  The difference between Labour and the Tories on government spending for instance is just a couple of percent of GDP but the conflict over the narrow strip of ideological territory is consistently painted as if it is equivalent to the difference between the extreme right in the US and the extreme left in Sweden.  It is that escalation of difference and painting of sides into extremist corners that feeds into this sense that if your team isn't in power then the *enemy* is, not just another party whose aims are within a small margin of difference from your own when looked at on a global, historical scale.",,/r/europe/comments/8liapo/i_am_alex_barker_the_financial_times_bureau_chief/dzi13a1/,Cryptoalt7,1527167994

I mean, mine isn't certainly radical, at all, but you clearly got very pissed here for some reason I can attain.

&gt;Cheap doesn't necessarily mean unhealty.

Of course not.

But sometimes it does, like in the case of industrial pastry, sugared drinks, or processed meat.

In the case of processed meat, a consumer that is not well versed in this may may think they're just buying cheaper meat with same products —as it happens with sugared drinks—, when in fact they'll be buying a product that has 10% less meat, for an example, and/or with more greasy parts of the animals instead of the actual meat. That's specially found in hot-dog like sausages.

In the case of phantom brands, this is also a relatively new phenomenon which made possible to buy twice the product, at the same price —only when the price of the brand product is purely inflated because of the brand, which happens with the cheaper things.

I don't think you can affirm that, in the course of a decade in which the salary hasn't changed, being able to buy twice the sugared drinks for the same price will have no impact in people's diet —and by extension, industrial pastry, ice cream, snaks, etc.

5794,"Periodical release of negative news about ""our enemies"" to keep up the opinion in the population strong. It is called conditioning.



&gt; Classical conditioning occurs when a conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US). Usually, the conditioned stimulus is a neutral stimulus (e.g., the sound of a tuning fork), the unconditioned stimulus is biologically potent (e.g., the taste of food) and the unconditioned response (UR) to the unconditioned stimulus is an unlearned reflex response (e.g., salivation). After pairing is repeated (some learning may occur after only one pairing), the organism exhibits a conditioned response (CR) to the conditioned stimulus when the conditioned stimulus is presented alone. The conditioned response is usually similar to the unconditioned response (see below), but unlike the unconditioned response, it must be acquired through experience and is relatively impermanent.[1]


&gt; In classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus is not simply connected to the unconditioned response; the conditioned response usually differs in some way from the unconditioned response, sometimes significantly. For this and other reasons, learning theorists commonly suggest that the conditioned stimulus comes to signal or predict the unconditioned stimulus, and go on to analyze the consequences of this signal.[2] Robert A. Rescorla provided a clear summary of this change in thinking, and its implications, in his 1988 article ""Pavlovian conditioning: It's not what you think it is"".[3] Despite its widespread acceptance, Rescorla's thesis may not be defensible.[4]


&gt; Classical conditioning differs from operant or instrumental conditioning: in classical conditioning, behaviors are modified through the association of stimuli as described above, whereas in operant conditioning behaviors are modified by the effect they produce (i.e., reward or punishment).[5] Although differences exists between classical and operant conditioning, both forms of conditioning are capable of changing the behavior of humans and non-human animals in predictable ways.[6]

5818,"Good product does not need advertising. Shitty ones do. If I want to buy a good pen I go to Amazon, and buy one with best reviews, or I can go to Costco and buy something under their brand (Kirkland). 

If someone knocks to my door, to offer me a pen for only $10, saying this pen is really worth 100, I begin to wonder why he has to go door to door to sell such an amazing product, why does he has to make 20 minute presentation about it, and how much of the money that I spend on this pen  goes for advertising it (paying a salesman doing presentation), and how much  it actually costed to produce it. If I buy Kirkland (Costco brand) product i know these pen were not advertised and if I pay $10 for it, than it costed about $8 to produce it. 

Simple rule that applies to all, be it phones like Iphone vs ZTE, cars like Dacia vs Smart, or even religious ideas like atheism vs Jehovah Witnesses. When my friend joined Catholic seminary, he and his  fellow seminarians were divided into groups and asked to make ads for Catholicism. He said they were pretty shitty ads and teacher an elderly priest told them, you can not advertise it, Catholicism lasts for 2000 years not because it has good ads, but because it has none.

I sometimes write on exmormon reddit. This cult has awesome ads and spends tons of money on PR companies. Currently they are in a crisis, despite and maybe because this awesome PR (many ex members accuse LDS of misleading, and lying to them).

III Reich that was supposed to last 1000 years has fallen after 12 despite and maybe, because of genius of Goebbels.


I am a supporter of EU and would love it to last long. But trust me, if someone responsible for budget of EU decided that money spend on these ads (only few hundred views on youtube) should be spend on poor children in Romania, or Bulgaria, it would not make EU weaker, it would make EU stronger. 


And just a short explenation. Pens I wrote about are just an example, I do not know if they cost $10 and if Costco sells them. Similarly I am not advocating for or against Catholic church or atheism I am just mentioning these as examples. Lastly I am not compering EU to III Reich and am a supporter of cooperation between european countries.
