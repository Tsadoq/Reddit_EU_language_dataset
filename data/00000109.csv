296,"&gt; The Netherlands has produced a more ambitious carbon plan for 2030 and recently passed a law to end all coal power generation by that date.

This is probably even a bigger issue. A lot of houses (~1.5-2 million official estimates) still use gas for things like cooking, heating etc. But government wishes to change this. However this switch for most households will be very expensive (easily 30.000 euro, which is like the median annual salary here pre taxation). 

&gt; The unfortunate thing is they postponed [it] for too long. They could have started in 2015…

With barely any economic growth, cuts and hitting your industries would've been a smart thing? 

&gt; Public opinion in the Netherlands will undoubtedly play an important role. Van Berkel said the initial 2015 judgment “really changed the political debate” in the Netherlands and made it more difficult for the government to avoid action.

What? Institutions shape this public opinion by enforcing rules and legislation on climate. The population mostly cares about their wallet in all of this, only a tiny minority protests climate policy with the goal of enacting stricter policies or guiding policies towards something. As was shown in earlier polls, around 85-90% of the population supports farmers protesting government decisions to make rules and impose stricter regulations on them making many farming businesses unprofitable.

Some of these policies are really ineffective on a global scale as well, for example the ones targeting farms. Dutch farming has high standards and is much cleaner than other places in the world. So you reduce farming output -&gt; farming output goes somewhere else that has more lax standards leading to an overall increase in emissions. Also, reducing your own agricultural sector would make you more reliant on other nations which brings its own set of undesirable problems (hence why farming is heavily subsidized by local country governments as well as by EU).",,/r/europe/comments/fa2bwh/the_netherlands_faces_pressure_as_global_test/fiwlf4v/,Neo_Metalsonic,1582790925

There is no evidence that this article was written by communists, nor that Wikipedia is controlled by communists. In fact, Wikipedia contains copious material critical of communist regimes.

In the Netherlands, there is general consensus between left, center and right that this happened. 

It is mostly you, hearing about this for the first time, apparently, who cannot bring himself to accept this as historical fact. You can always come here and talk to the surviviing family members of the 9 people who were murdered, the 24 heavily wounded or the large number of people arrested by the German occupier and imprisoned. 300,000 people participated in the strike, organised by the communist party CPN. There are more than enough witness accounts. 

But I don't think you will. I don't think you care. Judging by your name, you're here to spread far-right propaganda.

As for Nazis and ""commies"" being allies: the Molotov Ribbentrop pact was a brief period where Stalin intended to protect the Soviet Union from a German force he knew to be superior, and after he, paranoid as he was, had many of his most competent officers executed. Hitler absolutely despised communists, and in fact, the Reichstag Fire which cemented Nazi rule, was deliberately blamed on Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe so Hitler could claim Germany was being besieged by communist enemies. This was a pact between two deeply hostile powers which soon dissolved. The ensuing war between Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany on the Eastern Front was perhaps the most brutal war in historical memory. You can tell by the enormous number of Soviet and German casualties there:

330,"&gt;unlike the flu, there are no vaccines or herd immunity to coronavirus, so could potentially infect far more people.

There are no vaccines *yet*. We will most likely have a couple in a few months.

There will be herd immunity, gained naturally by infected people.

There isn't much of a herd immunity for the flu either btw, because an astonishing number of people don't get vaccinated. The antivax movement *really* needs a solid kick in the teeth.

&gt;Remember: [the Spanish Flu had a death rate of 3% too](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/44123/9789241547680_eng.pdf); it was worse than WWI because our lack of immunity allowed it to run rampant in populations and reach far greater numbers than the seasonal flu.

Actually there are mostly other reasons that exacerbated the results of the Spanish flu, among other the fact there was a war on. Not only did the war reduce possibilities for treating dealing with it properly; limited resources meant additional hardship like malnutrition, filth, which contributed to weakened people and secondary bacterial infections. The movement of troops greatly increased transmission. The way they handled sick soldiers further contributed to the auto-selection of the tougher strain. Last but not least it is unclear how many deaths were caused by the flu and how many by the war since both affected young people disproportionately and numbers were reported bundled together.

And btw there was immunity to the Spanish flu, since the virus suffered only minor mutations. People who survived previous waves did not get sick again, and China largely escaped it because they had immunity from a related virus a few years earlier.",🇪🇺,/r/europe/comments/f9rkw8/corona_virus_megathread/fiwelqk/,kare_kano,1582783111

It is dangerous to the future of their economies and to the belief in the next generation in both democracy as social democracy.

People wait till the last minute and panic. Stores are not setup for this and neither are their supply lines. So even if everything  runs 100% as normal (it won’t) there will be shortages. 

Stores do not stock 100% of their inventory each truck so if there is panic buying it will be tough if not impossible for stores to catch up. Especially during the types of lock downs that will come to contain this virus. It has an R naught of at least 5 even during containment situations. (R naught is the expected number of people to catch the virus from 1 carrier) this is pretty insane. 

Modern supply chains assume nothing crazy will happen. Because it’s the most cost effective and rarely do crazy things happen.

I would ask translation for this?

&gt; Wikipedia is not a source of academic knowledge

So much wrong with this. We are talking on reddit, not writing papers. Wikipedia is often full of nonsense, but is also often full of perfectly accurate information supported with references. So if you have problem with that, argue with the content. Finally, I was able to provide SOME evidence, you haven't. For now, the fact that proto-slavic word for mud is nowhere close to word Slovan or Slovien is good enough for me.

&gt; but I forgot that we slavs are stronk, deadly serious about ourselves, and we love our propaganda. That's because we are sad, little muddy people, witch makes perfect sense.

This has nothing to do with this nonsense and everything with you spreading bullshit. And when someone point it out you are ""meh sources meh propaganda"".

Wake up. There is no ""proof"" in empirical sciences. Just sufficient evidence. So what is more probable? That the word ""Slovan"" which is part of names of two nations (Slovaks and Slovenians) is derived from word ""slovo"" which holds the same form in almost all slavic languages and thus is either very new or very old, or from word gliba for mud that looks nothing like that?

Sure, there are other interpretations. Glory for slava is pushed by many Russians which claim at the same time that ethnolinguistic group would not call themselves ""people of the word"" (while Germans are still Mutes and many groups call themselves ""humans"").  I have even read that it comes from name for river (but thats a bit strange for such large dispersed group connected mostly by language). But given that some hypothesis suggest that Slavs were not really tightly genetically related and the slavic ethnolinguistic group formed through usage of proto-slavic language as linguia-franca, the interpretation of ""Slovan -- Word"" is just the most meaningful one out of available evidence.

&gt;Nazism was a diabolical ideology. But communism was even worse.

[Really? What ideology looks like it was worse for Poland?](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Population_of_Poland.svg/2560px-Population_of_Poland.svg.png) The one which murdered 10 million, or the much worse, much eviler and murderous one in which population growth rates largely recovered until the reintroduction of wondrous capitalism?

May I ask what was the literacy rate in your wondrous high standard of living country that apparently existed before communism? What was it afterward? I assume it was probably significantly higher? Funny how that works. The evil ideology which is probably the only reason you even know how to write this post.

As for standard of living, did it at any point actually decrease in Communist Poland? Besides in 1989, when it fell and shock doctrine neoliberal policies were applied in droves that drove people into poverty?

Of course just nurse those resentful wounds all you want while you constantly elect evil fascist ideology to power in Poland. We all know that [Poland celebrated Munich](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%88%D0%B0_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0_%D0%98%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%83_%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE.jpg) and[ fed on Czechoslovakia along with your friends Germany and Hungary like vultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Czechoslovak_border_conflicts#World_War_II), really it should be no surprised that you'd eventually find yourself going down this path and returning to old patterns.

Oh yeah, as for freedom, your post full of lies will probably stay up, while the wondrous enlightened neoliberal mods who constantly bend over and enable fascism will inevitably censor this for wrongthink, for telling truths that are out of line with the neoliberal/neofascist mainstream thought. So much for freedom. Europe has five years at this rate until its going to be a fascist Nazi dictatorship. The fall of the Soviet Union was the biggest mistake in human history.

Congratulations. You disagree with the official scientific and etymological explanation of the term ""embryo""

&gt;And the DNA of the virus also shows its distinction from the mother. Still they're both dependent on her body. No mother, no embryo.

A virus isnt a human. period.

&gt;Alright, I guess you're just a hypocrite then.

The sad moment you realize your arguments are fading one by one. 

&gt;But I am a very complex lump of cells with its own consciousness. Unlike the fetus I'm also able to survive on my own. Pretty different.

But you are still just a lump of cells. Consciousness isnt part of what makes something alive or not. But hey I am going to use your logic: So its perfectly fine to kill somebody who is going to be in a coma for a known duration of 9 months. Alright got it. 

&gt;So if the child dies within the first few months of its life because its conditions of living are so horrid,

Nobody will suffer this fate in a civilized and progressive society. But hey even if the human has only 1% chance of survival its still worth it. Rather have 1% chance of survival than 100% chance of instant certain death. 

&gt;You have to be either uneducated or fooling yourself if you don't think a pregnancy comes with massive health detriments. But from the rest of your arguments, I'd say you're just misogynistic.

I don't understand why the EU is entitled to self-preserve for its own sake, it only exists by the leave &amp; consent of the member states and at root, their electorates, the people of Europe. 

The EU is therefore morally obligated to hold the view that its own dissolution/collapse would be the best outcome *if* it comes about as a result of the wishes/freely chosen actions of the people of Europe.

If countries start wanting looser trade deals and less integration, and so many want it that the EU in its current form ceases to exist or evolve to something else, then how is that not completely legitimate?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The legislation endorsed Wednesday also would extend the definition of criminal hate speech to include threats of rape or property damage and expressing approval for serious crimes.    
&gt;  
&gt;The bill would make showing public support for crimes, including threats of harm to people or their homes, a punishable offense. In practice, retweeting hate speech to a wide audience, or explicitly condoning it on a public forum, could be subject to prosecution if the new measures become law.  
&gt;  
&gt;Officials said it would be up to the courts to decide which posts or shares meet the threshold of “disturbing public peace.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Jurists estimate the number of online hate speech cases in Germany each year to be in the six figures. Hundreds of additional police officers and prosecutors will be required to handle the workload.

1329,"Ah ok you wrote about overlap between Linke and AfD, not Linke and CDU. My bad. That being said outside of them both being protest parties I don't think Linke and AfD have any overlap.

a) It supports my argument because the AfD was willing to cast their vote in favor of another candidate. You think of the AfD as a single block, but in reality the AfD just as any other party are a bunch of people making their own decisions and need to be convinced by their respective leader to run into the same direction. There isn't necessarily unison between them (as shown when the right won wing against Lucke and Petri) and the fact that they could cohesively cast their vote in favor of a FDP candidate shows that he's not unacceptable for them. 

b) The AfD had their own candidate and voted for him first, but then switched. Which is perfectly normal, if you don't think you can get your own one through you pick the one most acceptable for you. It's f.e. how von der Leyen got elected recently, when parties stalemate you start looking for third choices that are acceptable.

c) The outrage was about FDP and CDU voting for their own candidate instead of the left one, which is an extremely stupid expectation. The FDP going for a minority government instead of CDU or FDP voting for a left candidate shouldn't surprise anyone. There wasn't a coalition, the FDP wasn't reliant on the AfD specifically, they were reliant on other parties working with them. The party I'm most mad about in the whole affair are the SPD, because they could have easily pushed a candidate forward that would have been electable by most of the parliament.

Reporters have been asking about red+red+green for ages, they have been asking about blue+black for long. They ask because these parties have overlap in positions, which is the base for forming a coalition. Red+red+green was long sneered at as well and now it's fairly common on state level despite the fact that the left have some points the SPD would never agree to.",,/r/europe/comments/f8c7vm/exit_poll_of_the_hamburg_regional_elections_spd/fit90oi/,r43n,1582710124

Not possible. The industry is hanging by a thread. Maybe if the oil price reaches an all time high, but that's not happening any time soon. The oil in the North Sea is growing ever more difficult to extract - the easy stuff has been used up. Oil will soon be a thing of the past in the timespans that are important to countries.

That logic is so bad to me. It can literally be applied to any safety item. 

- “Oh you wear safety helmets? That must mean you’re willing to take more risks because your head is safe!”
- “oh you have seatbelts in your car? If you need that to be safe you’re driving too recklessly!”
- “oh you need to chlorine rinse your chicken to get rid of remnant bacteria, if you need that then the rest of your processes must be bad!”

It’s flat protectionism.[it’s why Europe has significantly higher campylobacteriosis cases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462680/) which is the main cause of food sickness and is eliminated with chlorine rinses... 

“The U.S. Food-Borne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (1996 to 2012) reported an annual incidence of 14.3 per 100,000 population for Campylobacter infection” 

“Europe. The most current evaluation of the epidemiology of campylobacteriosis in 27 European Union (EU) state members indicated the incidences of Campylobacter infections to range from 29.9 to 13,500 per 100,000 population in 2009 (with the lowest incidences in Finland and Sweden and the highest in Bulgaria) (46). Overall, this equated to 9.2 million cases, compared to 6.2 million cases of salmonellosis, in 2009 (46).”",,/r/europe/comments/f96w9m/eu_demands_uk_keeps_chlorinated_chicken_ban_to/fisobed/,randocadet,1582689090

1631,"“How often does the holodomor come up on this subreddit”

It comes up regularly, but not as much as the holocaust for several reasons.

The Holodomor was also a significant event, but not quite as well documented and resulted in several times less deaths as the Holocaust by most estimates. In addition to this, there is dispute over whether the holodomor was the result of an unintended widespread famine, or over how much of it was pre-meditated.

With the Holocaust though, there is no dispute, except from neo-Nazis, white nationalists, etc., you’re not one of those are you? The Holocaust without question was the most significant, pre-mediated, well planned, and systematic genocide ever in human history. It was also more or less the only truly industrialized genocide, so it warrants the attention it gets. 

“You’re not respecting the tragedy by using it to police people. You’re just not.”

With respect, I disagree. I believe genocide denial is actually a small step in the direction of normalizing similar acts in the future. For example, I admire Germany’s current approach towards non-tolerance of intolerance, and believe it should not only be maintained, but re-doubled. 

Regarding Poland, I don’t disagree with you. I don’t think it’s fair at all to criticize the Polish people’s conduct during the war, and if anything they collaborated with the Nazis far far less than any other European nation that fell under German occupation. I disagree with the current right wing Israeli government’s (which has found lots of support among other right wing European governments like Orban in Hungary) ridiculous insinuation that the Polish nation/people were somehow even a little bit responsible for the holocaust. So on the whole Poland taking responsibility for the holocaust on Polish territory I firmly agree with the Polish government/people’s position, and think the Israelis selfishly created an issue out of literally nothing. 

All that being said. Poland and polish people which have suffered so much in history for their race, culture, etc. (especially during WW2) have interestingly come under a pretty right wing and often xenophobic government which has difficulty empathizing with others. 

What does any of that have to do with talking about the holocaust though? If anything the Holocaust isn’t talked about enough. That’s how bad it was. My understanding is that you are connecting discussion about the holocaust to Poland’s responsibility for it on Polish soil, but the two are not connected.",,/r/europe/comments/f9bzuy/the_polish_national_hero_who_willingly_became/fisq52u/,Babl1339,1582690374

1657,"&gt; With respect, I disagree. I believe genocide denial

Who was talking about genocide denial? 

Look at the title of this thread. “The Polish national hero who willingly became Auschwitz prisoner No. 4859.”  Why would Poland need such a national hero? *To play defense.* Polish honor is relentlessly attacked *in the name of* preventing another holocaust. It’s not just wrong, it’s disgusting. Note that when I say “in the name of,” I don’t  mean “in the service of.” I don’t buy—in fact, I explicitly reject—a functional connection between unfairly maligning the Poles and preventing a genocide. 

It’s a cudgel. That’s all it is. 

Everyone likes to think they would have been like Sophie Scholl (google her, I don’t have time). Yet we find ourselves in a situation today where the powerful are unfairly attacking a smaller group, and who will come to their rescue? No one. Cowards, all. Pathetic, sniveling cowards. Their morality isn’t tied up in genocide prevention; it’s tied up in the same damn thing that got people to join the SS. They’re playing follow the leader. That’s what cowards do in violent times: they seek shelter with the powerful, and they prove their loyalty by abusing the powerless. No lessons have been learned. No moral progress has been made. 

I would want to let them off the hook. I would want to say, “Hey, it’s not their fault that they’ve confused the aesthetic parallels of Nazism and immigration restriction.

Poland will launch six new laboratories that will run tests for coronavirus, in addition to the two already operational, PM Mateusz Morawiecki said on Monday.

Earlier on Monday, the prime minister held consultations with all province governors and province sanitary inspectors in order to align policies aimed to limit the spread of the virus in Poland.

Morawiecki said the six additional labs were being launched just in case, as there was no immediate need for them.

""However, we want to be prepared (...) should the virus appear in Poland and affect a greater number of people,"" Morawiecki said.

The prime minister also said the government had prepared mobile text messages with coronavirus instructions for all Poles coming back to the country from abroad.

1907,"&gt; Well, yes. That's my point.
&gt; 
&gt; You're using ratios of prices per unit of energy supplied to estimate ratios in installed capacity. You're confusing energy with power.
&gt; 
&gt; Nuclear and wind power have very different capacity factors. You can't compare capacity based on energy supplied without taking that in consideration.

No, I'm estimating *investment cost*. That's why they use kWh: it doesn't matter what the nameplate capacity of the installations is, just how much kWh they delivered over time.

&gt;It's a bit early to say that PTG is an adequate solution to the problem of renewable intermittence then, isn't it?

Did I say that then? It's a promising solution, solving several problems at once. Therefore the price can be pretty high and it will still be useful, if not for general purpose then for niche uses certainly.

&gt;The link I've provided explicitly accounts for all of those things. It's a 223 pages-long report from France's Court of Audit). I'm not sure how it can get any more transparent.

~~Ok, but that's not for tonight.~~ 
edit: skimming the table of contents. It has headers for:

- running costs (fuel, personnel, etc.)

- maintenance costs

- future costs (dismantling, waste, etc.)

- taxes and provisions

- other budget expenses (some R&amp;D, some security, and that's it)

- nuclear risks

It does *not* seem to account for initial investment costs, which is the bulk of the cost. Nor does it evaluate whether there are items in the military budget that ended up subsidizing the enterpirse, in particular relating to the nuclear missile capacity. So that's a really big hole, and it's only good to estimate the cost of the existing fleet, ignoring sunk costs of the past. That's somewhat useful to compare to new capacity, but it's not useful at all to decide what the total lifetime cost of nuclear is. And that's assuming it's possible to average out the cost of large accidents, which it isn't.

&gt;State support is often required to build NPPs because, since most of the costs are due to construction, time to ROI is very long. Not very attractive to most investors.

That would be acceptable. But the problem is that the state support also covers risks like meltdown risks, and by necessity, risks of mishaps with waste storage. Insurance for that on the private market would triple the price.

Another reason is that renewables are making such advances that the private market expects that nuclear plants will be obsolete, and they don't like their capital getting stranded in an unprofitable investment.

&gt;It's a bit like investing in renewables when your electricity grid was built around fossil fuels. You need a substantial amount of state investments to accommodate intermittent renewables' particular needs, and public subsidies (like fixed tariffs) to ensure competitiveness with competitors.

Obviously renewable energy needs support to catch up with the suport other energy sources have been getting over the years, to get to a level playing field.

You mean fixed tariffs, like the Hinkley Point NPP is getting? But Hinkley Point is getting tariffs that are substantially higher than the price of wind energy... https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/10/uk-windfarms-become-cheaper-than-hinkley-point-c

&gt;I have my doubts. It takes more than a hunch to establish a viable energy transition. Do you have concrete figures regarding this guess?

The link I gave earlier has an outline of the needed steps on a timeline. And a lot of links that I didn't all follow either.

&gt;It's pretty much just hydro. Even then, hydro storage capacity is pretty low AFAIK.

The current fraction of renewable energy on the German grid is already higher than expected, so it seems to be working out fine.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/f67sv5/two_weeks_of_wind_power_production_in_germany/firld16/,silverionmox,1582666579

1920,"&gt;It was an interview and reporter justified it by his party demonizing LGBT people during campaign (eg just week ago chief strategist of Smer party went to telly discussion with under-secretary of libertarian one and pulled a photo where she is with someone in drag on PRIDE and started saying how she should tell children if that is a man or a woman).

Given the amount of shit his party has thrown over the past couple years at everyone who doesn't agree with them (whether it's liberals, gays, immigrants) I would say it's a quite an easy softball (and valid) question that he should've been prepared to lie about.

His answer wasn't exactly convincing (to no one's surprise) so they called their buddies (who own the paper) and that part of the article wasn't printed, after that Editor in chief quit, and how this guy ""voluntarily quit"".

Also it's important to understand that this guy is not a PM by a standard definition, he's essentially a puppet to Fico (who is the party leader), who's been in the govt for almost 12 years but was forced to step down after murder of a journalist and following links of those involved with him and others in government. He's not calling any shots, he's only there because he wasn't involved in any major scandals and was a ""pretty face"" for ads.

What's sad is this is what seems to anger him and his party more than everything that happened in this country in past years, including murder of journalist and his fiancee, ton of shit that flows up to the highest levels of government, police, justice (it's really quite a story).",,/r/europe/comments/f98dsp/slovak_journalist_loses_his_job_after_asking_pm/firlley/,Airf0rce,1582666705

1925,"How part of it works in laymans terms:

We all got a set of immuno genes (google hint: MHC). These genes get (sloppily) translated in molecules which will bind to other molecules in your body and set off an immune reaction by doing so. This in turn will lead to the (sloppy) duplication of the binded molecules and different types of immune response molecules. Sloppily means there will be many different versions created, some of which may bind better.

Eventually there is a bit of evolution going on within your body, molecules binding the best will set off the strongest reaction and get duplicated the most.  Until you've got a lot of those molecules binding really tight to the foreign viral/bacterial/organic/(sometimes even your own body -&gt; autoimmune disease) obliterating whatever they are binding to.  A couple of those molecules will go to 'sleep' and keep guarding your body until they find something they can bind to again, and start the cycle once more. (google hint: Adaptive and acquired immune response)

&amp;#x200B;

But you may be out of luck in the gene department, or in the translating department, and there are no molecules created that bind (well) to a certain danger like a virus. So  that virus, can replicate as much as it wants. And your body has a hard time fighting it off.

Sometimes you are a bit out of luck, and most molecules created bind weakly. And that tiny evolutionary cycle, of duplicating those few molecules,is going to take, what feels like, forever to evolve and find a very effective molecule or create enough weak binding ones to fight of the virus.

Sometimes you may be very lucky, and there is already a very effective molecule created, and it  binds, replicates and obliterates the virus really fast.

And sometimes you may have come across something similar, and some of the molecules that are 'asleep'  will become active again and set of a reaction really fast.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course being fit and well fed will help to to give your immune system all the resources it needs to create an effective response and react as fast as it can.

It seems to be transmitted mainly via droplets that land on surfaces that people touch, and then touch their faces. So try to train yourself not to touch your face in public until you have washed your hands.

Also - carry sanitiser and clean your phones, pens etc with it.

Wash your clothes at a high temperature (55 C kills the virus).

There is also a suggestion that there is some airborne transmission, but that can be reduced by opening windows.

If the entire community practices hygiene (and sick people stay at home), there is every chance of getting through this.

You're preaching to and atheist, and so was your teacher. Chinese people don't care about religion by majority.

They shouldn't mistreat them at anyrate, just expel them, but that's fantasy I suppose.

Watching a protest to see what the angry mob is saying about you seems pretty normal, what embassy/country wouldn't.

Every country spies, a lot. You might be prejudiced since China is known for making copies (non identical) of things cheaply, but it's not illegal, and capitalism in the west is what favours these actions since they're the ones buying. 
China makes lots of it's own technology, their better at it often. We can't know what is or isn't stolen, probably no single person (even within intelligence organisations) knows. It's pretty cut throat, I think you're right in saying Chinese steal from eachother.
All large companies, including Americans, have dubious use if people data. It's a modern reality. 

Investments and contracts with single EU countries is extremely dangerous in my opinion. It's divisive. 

I imagine you have it in for Huawei just because it's a hot topic, but their not the first shady company and won't be the last. They probably want to get back on peoples good side now anyway, and will make changes to this end.

2000,"&gt; Those are some of the things that come with doing international business though. Why should services being sold to consumers somewhere else not fall under VAT.

Because they aren't taxed domestically. What's worse, they wouldn't be taxed domestically in those _other_ countries either, if they were actually a domestic business there. And that's just the legal side of it. The absurdity of paying tax to a foreign country that amounts to a couple of euros, where the cost of compliance is higher than the taxes owed is what takes the cake.

&gt; The systems can be better of course, but that is not a reason to me to throw the whole idea away.

That's the logic that essentially lead us to that very same point. ""Screwing over thousands of small creators is fine as long as we get Amazon!""

It's also the reason why some people are becoming extremely skeptical when the government says ""just trust us"". 

&gt; But I think that corporations not paying taxes and abusing the loopholes hurts us more.

2110,"It's true that there are plenty of leftwing echo chambers, most of reddit for one, but I don't think they're equal. The extreme end between a leftwing and a rightwing echo chamber is quite different.

What are some opinions that someone who hasn't left his leftwing echo chamber for years might have? For example, calling others transphobic for not believing there are more than 2 genders. Or calling others racist for only wanting a limited number of skilled/educated immigrants every year. What about someone who hasn't left his rightwing echo chamber for years? They might express actual racist or homophobic views.

So far these are all simply opinions, you're free to disagree with those opinions, you can even call them idiots, but those opinions don't physically hurt anyone. Then you go deeper, and what do you get?

We just had a guy in Germany kill 10 people out of hatred for foreigners, and last year an alt-right guy killed 50 people in New Zealand. When is the last time a leftwinger was radicalized online and killed people? One echo chamber seems far worse than the other.

Depends on how you want things to function. With a lot of things it is better to pool the money and then spent it, since then cheaper prices can be negotiated for example. And if you let people pay out of pocket for more things on their own, that impact lower income families more.

Yes, since then you would have political parties running with a program of lowering taxes, which gets them votes.

2161,"&gt; I used the price per kWh in the studies I linked, not per MW. 

Well, yes. That's my point. 

You're using ratios of prices per **unit of energy supplied** to estimate ratios in **installed capacity**. You're confusing energy with power.

Nuclear and wind power have very different capacity factors. You can't compare capacity based on energy supplied without taking that in consideration.

&gt; It's too early for the numbers on that, for the reasons I already outlined: we relied on fossil gas to match supply and demand. I know that some research projects end this year so we'll have more numbers soon. 

It's a bit early to say that PTG is an adequate solution to the problem of renewable intermittence then, isn't it?

&gt; So I give you these calculations to show that there is substantial financial breathing room. 

You'll need to redo them properly, then.

&gt; So then you must include that capacity on both sides of the equation when comparing. 

Sure. My point was about the differences in required capacity. Not about arguing that nuclear required none.

&gt; The cost of nuclear power in France especially is hard to assess, as you run afoul of military secrecy, monopoly benefits, tax benefits, and non-financial benefits or hard to quantify benefits like the implicit or explicit liability for damage caused by meltdowns and storage problems in the future. 

The link I've provided *explicitly accounts for all of those things*. It's a 223 pages-long report from [France's Court of Audit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Audit_(France)). I'm not sure how it can get any more transparent.

This just sounds like an excuse. I keep seeing this argument come up again and again, unsourced.

&gt; The only thing that is certain that no nuclear plant has ever been built without substantial state support. 

Now [that's an odd remark to make from your position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Germany#Energy_transition):

&gt;The 2010 ""Energiewende"" policy has been embraced by the German federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables, particularly wind power. \[...\] **Producers have been guaranteed a fixed feed-in tariff for 20 years, guaranteeing a fixed income.** \[...\] Nuclear power plants were closed, and the existing 9 plants will close earlier than necessary, in 2022.  
&gt;  
&gt;The reduction of reliance on nuclear plants has so far had the consequence of increased reliance on fossil fuels and on electricity imports from France. However, in good wind Germany exports to France; in January 2015 the average price was €29/MWh in Germany, and €39/MWh in France. **One factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure (SüdLink) to bring the power to market.** **The transmission constraint sometimes causes Germany to pay** **Danish wind power** **to stop producing; in October/November 2015 this amounted to 96 GWh costing 1.8 million euros.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The German states have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines. **Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the Energiewende have been passed on to consumers, who have had rising electricity bills. Germans in 2013 had some of the highest electricity costs in Europe.**

State support is often required to build NPPs because, since most of the costs are due to construction, time to ROI is very long. Not very attractive to most investors.

It's a bit like investing in renewables when your electricity grid was built around fossil fuels. You need a substantial amount of state investments to accommodate intermittent renewables' particular needs, and public subsidies (like fixed tariffs) to ensure competitiveness with competitors.

There's nothing wrong with a power source requiring state support to function. But you should at least recognize that it's not specific to NPPs and look at the investments that were required for renewables rather than gloss over them like you did.

&gt; The study does make a distinction between new nuclear and old nuclear, too. 

And why do you think new nuclear costs more than old nuclear, despite technology having improved since then?

&gt; France's cost structure is hazy, as mentioned above. 

Again, citation needed.

&gt; They also *do* have 30% non-nuclear support which is used heavily as dispatchable power, so if you want to use that as point of comparison with renewables, then you have to include the same flexible capacity. 

That's fair.

&gt; I'm pretty sure you don't need very much more storage and flexibility if you already have that 30%. 

I have my doubts. It takes more than a hunch to establish a viable energy transition. Do you have concrete figures regarding this guess?

&gt; Yes, there will occasionally be holes in baseload. But it remains to be seen to what degree existing capacity of hydro and others can cope with that already. 

It's pretty much just hydro. Even then, hydro storage capacity is pretty low AFAIK.",,/r/europe/comments/f67sv5/two_weeks_of_wind_power_production_in_germany/fiqwm9g/,Perett2822120,1582652958

This is why people patting themselves on the back for this is so frustrating. Iceland had to offer deposit insurance to all EU depositors to have access to the European market. They revoked this coverage for non-Icelandic citizens the day before they nationalized banks, leaving their European depositors high and dry. These depositors then had to be made whole by their own governments instead of Iceland.

It's not. The virus is not related in any way to the common flu, it's related to the SARS, of which is a less nasty strain. It still has a death rate that is (at least) ten times higher than the flu. And while young, healthy people don't usually die if they receive proper care, they can get in very serious conditions, like patient 1 in Italy (38 years old, did sports, perfect health, now in critical condition). As long as you have enough space in the ICU, you can cure everyone. But if the contagion spreads like it did to China (where young people *have* died, starting with Li Wenliang) and the infected become tens of thousands, then you won't have enough places in intensive care for everyone.

2293,"Ok, this is pure propaganda, and basically none of this is true. There was no point in the dualism when it was forbidden to speak minority languages anywhere in the country. In fact there was a law in effect (1868. XLIV), which compelled law courts and municipal offices to conduct business in minority languages.

The Cernova massacre wasn't ethnic violence - five of the seven gendarmeries were Slovak, including the commander who gave the order to fire. See Roman Holec: *Tragédia v Černovej a slovenská spoločnosť*, Matica slovenská, 1997.

Gendarmerie was known for its brutal methods in general, between 1891 and 1910 they killed 61 people when supressing socialist or socialdemocrat protests, and injured more than 800. If anything the brutality of the gendarmerie was inspired by class-ideology, not nationalism.

Magyarization did exist, but it only gained steam after 1890 (and especially after 1906), and what it mostly meant was that the government tried to turn the teaching language in schools into Hungarian. With Slovakian and German-speaking schools this policy was actually pursued, with Romanian schools it wasn't.

Between 1890 and 1914 around 800 Slovakian-teaching schools were turned into Hungarian-teaching ones. Also new schools built in these two decades started teaching in Hungarian.

Wouldn't call it a discussion since you are only insulting me in most of your comments and saying senseless things. 

&gt;Sure sure. GoebbelsTV is showing pis politicians 80-90% of the time but it’s all in a not so positive light haha.

Not even true, funny how you are crying about their propaganda and calling them GoebbelsTV, and then in the exact same comment you are using anti-PIS propaganda. Once again you proved your hypocrisy. Imagine trying to fight propaganda with propaganda. 

&gt;Edit: you’re afraid to take the bet. Ok. But let’s make one thing clear: from your dumb statements one can infer that if I showed you proof that PO led TVP gave 40% of time to PO politicians and PIs gives 80-90% to itself - it would mean nothing, right?😂😂😂

The 80-90% is bullshit so you won't. But if we would imagine it's true and you showed me proofs of it, it still would mean nothing. Just random numbers out of context. No wonder you are biased if you believe every random number you see out of context. 

&gt;And anyway, one of the analysis clearly stated that there were about 50 reports about PO on GoebbelsTV and none! of them even neutral - all negative. But sure, go ahead make up some other excuse.

2.Pretend you know someone living there who knows better than anyone about the subject

3.Pretend it's a relative or *honorable* elder who was *there*

6.Accuse people of being American

Hell the more conservative wing of the CDU and the less radical wing of the AfD could probably work together without any problems in terms of family, agrarian and security sector. The CDU is more a worldview than a collection of similar opinions.

Naturally people like Höcke are way more radical and have positions that are non-negotiable for democratic parties.

You’re also ignoring the shift in the English name over a near 300 year window from *Kiou, Kiow, Kiew, Kiovia* to *Kiev* - surely we can accommodate a simple request to use the romanised version the Ukranians deem correct?

2822,"&gt;Practically speaking, the public have 0 say in the decision.

By ""*practically*"", you're actually refering to *immediate* decisional power of the public. *I.e.* pure direct democracy, again.

I could argue, again, that it isn't even remotely a prerequisite for full and practical democratic exercise of power by citizens, but merely one framework amongst others, which are just as equally functionally democratic.

But because you're taking such an extreme and idealised (thus unpractical, unbalanced and simplistic) stance about democracy and its fundamental mechanics, we won't be able to agree on even the basics. You're simply not interested in contrasting views, and yours seems to be the only way you can conceive it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Again, which I want changed to a direct democracy - only possible after leaving the EU.

And it simply won't happen, because it's flat out unrealistic. I honestly don't mean to be patronising, but I don't think you fully apprehend the **staggering** intricacy of the reality of government and the legislative process.

Incidentally, the EU didn't inherently prevent you from making such a change nationally. And you simply would have had to convince the rest of us in order to have it applied at the highest institutional level aswell: the EU. And that, too, is democracy, which you circumvent by advocating splitting off when it doesn't go your way, rather than finding mutually beneficial compromises.

The principle of ""*educating the public with your message if you believe it to be so self-evidently good* [that] *you will be successful*"" is sound, but it also applies to you. If your only solution, when it doesn't work, is to split off from the group, your ""*demos*"" will rather sooner than later be limited to your neighbourhood. Or your family. Or even just yourself.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;If you are scared of the will of the people, you are scared of democracy.

I expected that kind of comment when I wrote that specific part, and it reinforces my impression that your views are overly candid, naive and lacking perspective.

I'm sorry, but bluntly put, that's just a ridiculously simplistic mantra. As a matter of fact, yes, you should be scared of the will of the people. Counterpowers and safeguards emerged in nascent democracies precisely because the ""will of the people"", when given free rein, transforms into [mob rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority). 

Modern democracy isn't simply about being the majority. It's first and foremost about building political and societal compromises, through thorough investigations and debates, to ultimately balance out the various interests within society, with as much clarity, knowledge, fairness and rationality as possible. Otherwise, your regime is little more than a fancy avatar of the principle that might is right.

A succession of crisises, trials and errors slowly and incrementally made European democracies what they currently are. By now, we have fairly good clues about what works and what doesn't, what is safe and what isn't, and the virtues, hazards and limits of ""the will of the people"".

&amp;nbsp;

Overall, yours is a purely theoretical view. It may be good-willed, but I'm more interested with how democratic mechanics behave when they're *actually* put into practice in the real world, than with intangible abstracts, regardless of how attractive they may sound.

And a final note regarding your plea to ""educate the masses"" against populism: the reason Brexit was controversial at all is precisely because it was widely deemed, both within the UK and abroad, a campaign riddled with gross misinformation and manipulation, which led --*regardless of the now known outcome*-- to an overall misinformed decision from the British people, in one of those direct democracy votes that you're adamantly calling for.

You, of course, probably don't see it that way, because Brexit was apparently the outcome that you expected. Which is convenient for you, but also precisely my point: for a lot of people, your choice may have been grossly misinformed. But regardless if it actually was... *you* don't see it that way. And thus, you decision, informed or not, still have direct and long-term consequences for several dozen million of your countrymen.

1. The chances you get infected are tiny. Especially as the outbreak is in Milan, not Rome. Zürich, Lyon and München are all closer to Milan than Rome.

2893,"ok as i come from the region of Dijon and i dont want to go to sleep, i will add my touch of mustard in this thread, i can't resist sorry. 

In the burgundy families mustard is always on the table, but only the hot and not sweet one,  either plain or with seeds. The only traditionnally-made brand left is ""Edmont Fallot"" (from Beaune but also present in Dijon) if ever one day you guys happen to visit one of these cities, go and visit the boutique  Fallot , you'll be able to choose among lots of natural flavors added above the basic recipe.

So... we use mustard with steak indeed but we dont flood the dish or spread it on the meat , we dip the steak chunks in it with measure. 

It's also very good with pork coldmeat, or even with cooked ham in a pan with mustard, white wine, and mushrooms.

We also often use it to make the ""vinaigrette"" sauce that can feet pretty much any vegetables usually raw but sometimes also cooked ( leaks or artichokes vinaigrette mmm) , and we add  mustard ine the recipe of mayonnaise.

Also we have a few traditional recipes where you add mustard to the meat juices as in ""Lapin à la moutarde"" (Rabbit with mustard, i can hear people ticking on the word ""rabbit"" hehe) , or ""poulet à la gaston gerard"" (chicken with a sauce made of comté cheese, white wine and mustard), that one is a double killer : killer taste + and killer fat

Start putting the tomatoes in the pan on the side they were cut, the flame has to be lively, but don't burn them! After some time you can mix them, add some pasta cooking water to avoid them to burn (the cooking of the sauce takes 10/15 minutes, you can do it while cooking the pasta). Add salt and, if you like it, a little bit of chili pepper. Mix the sauce and the pasta and put it on a dish. If you want you can add basil cut in pieces by hand, grated cheese (Parmigiano and pecorino are obviously the best choices, but probably if you have something else it's ok) or another bit of oil on top of the dish.

3023,"No problem with a late reply, and I'll do my best to expand, thought to be fair many of these issues are pretty wide-spanning in their underpinnings ( Which is why there are experts who dedicate years just to study elements of the conflict ), but I'll try to be concise.

&gt;To me it's this incredibly naive thing that especially communists and socialists apply to the conflict because they believe in a ""classless, stateless society"" and so what better place to start than Israel-Palestine?!

The primary obstacle to the utopian vision of the perfectly melded, borderless society, be it a communist or socialist one, and specifically in the context of Israel-Palestine or the Middle-East ( For Europe or North America, perhaps unification steps would be easier, as they were not embroiled in vicious wars for many decades now ), is that as the famous communist saying goes, yet some fail to heed - ""The revolution is global"". In the economical sense, you might always need imports from a board such as oil, rare minerals and so on, and if you have to trade for them with capitalist enterprises while adhering to communist production at home, the two might clash, even *if* hypothetically the system might be viable were everyone to follow it. And needless to say, every citizen would likewise need to participate in good faith in order to prevent stagnation.

Point being, everyone has to play by the same rules, or else the rules end up backfiring on those who follow them. Israel, and the Palestinian Territories, are currently both home to demographics which express very strong nationalistic sentiments, and feelings regarding who is 'legitimate' and who is not, as can be seen in every poll, street interview, or other form of communication conducted on the matter. Even if there were those who wanted it, such a state would not last long if there was a sizeable percentage which did not desire it. I'm not sure I have much to add to what you've said, since you put it very accurately - Hamas and the IDF dropped in together, and both now carrying arms in the joint military? Countless people who think they have a 'blood debt' to fulfill for a slain relative? Settlers along with the radicals, not to mention all socioeconomic differences - largely uneducated/impoverished Gazans or West Bank residents, many of whom cannot speak Hebrew, many of whom hold to very traditional ideals ( Including about how the state level should operate ) according to data, just tossed up with the far more wealthier, more statistically secular Israelis at Tel-Aviv whom they might perceive as sworn enemies?

It just seems like every single ingredient primed for a civil war or societal chaos and even more stratification ready to boil. And what of the neighboring states, many of which are still classified as Arab Republic or else naturally have their intact nationalistic tendencies? You have Bashar Al-Assad in Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and it's hard to tell which dictator might seize control in Egypt at some point, what guarantee is there that they won't try to exploit any fragmentation or disintegration to their advantage? The 'revolution' is not global, which means that not everyone has to play by the same rules.

All of this is very well-known to most diplomatic experts, which is why the two-state solution is international consensus, and why the US, the EU, Asia, even the Arab League have always been prone to keep repeating ""two-state solution, two-state solution"". Because the key to responsibly managing major conflicts of this nature ( As history tells us ) is de-escalation. There first needs to be a peace agreement, a period of calm, of development for the Palestinian side and quiet for the Israeli side, where both sides are independent and get to shape their social fabric, before everything else is on the table. One-state solution would be analogical to trying to force two enemies straight into bed with each other before they even made up their differences. It's not very realistic, and most governments acknowledge that.

&gt;Do you believe in the long term it's going to end up as a 2 state solution, or is there any case in which the Israeli people would be forced into a 1 state solution?

I'm honestly not sure at this point, but I don't think it can reach a state of being forced without escalating into a full-blown war. A forced 1-state solution from the Israeli perspective would essentially entail enabling any militant in the territories who's hostile to Israel ( Hamas, Islamic Jihad, independents, etc. ) in addition to everyone who doesn't think that Israelis should be permitted to stay or that Israeli society should exist at all alongside them to just march straight into every Israeli city and civilian center. At which point, either they just become immediately friendly, or if not - then it would get very bad, so I don't think that *anything* could pressure Israel into accepting that, because they would see it as the worst scenario possible, similar to being outright conquered.

The two-state solution is a much safer, more stable option, but the Israeli government currently has taken a hard turn right as you know and are even more content to simply insist on Trump's plan, which the Palestinians are not interested in. And there's also been an increase in rhetoric from the other side, though not so much the Palestinian government itself as a lot of supporters abroad about how Israel should not be a country at all, etc, and it's been feeding into each other.

&gt;Is there any meaningful political group in Israel that supports a 1 state solution?

Not really. Even the Joint Arab List's official manifesto calls for a two-state solution. 

&gt;Do you think if a 1 state solution looked all but inevitable for whatever reasons, Netanyahu (or another right-wing PM) would just unilaterally disengage from the West Bank to the separation wall for a shitty two-state solution for the Palestinians?

Absolutely, and then do whatever else it takes if that doesn't work out. 

&gt;Do you think there's a hope for a two-state solution if Bernie Sanders is elected US President?

Unfortunately not. In an effort to coax votes from Netanyahu's camp, Gantz ( Who is more of a centrist to begin with ) has been moving to the right, promising to never allow a Palestinian capital in Jerusalem, to keep control of most of the West Bank, and distancing himself from any possible collaboration with the Joint List. Politicians in Israel typically value their domestic approval ( And re-election chances ) much moreso than foreign policy, even when it comes to the USA. There is generally no scenario in which an Israeli PM at this point is likely to violate a campaign promise or lose all future voters in order to do something that an American president asks him to, even if it results in a crisis and repercussions. And usually the strategy is to stall, offer token gestures, or try to stay under the radar until another president is elected. Labour and Meretz could work out, considering that rejecting the classic two-state solution isn't vital to their campaign or bases, but they do not have a remote chance of garnering enough seats.

&gt;why is Israel so obsessed with having the Jordan Valley in most peace plans they offer?

I suspect it might have to do with electoral considerations, given that many demographics assert it's an historical Israeli land that should be retained, it's partially a matter of pride, there are economical considerations to it ( Tourism, water rights, resources, etc. ), the fact that plenty of Israeli settlements and establishments have been built there, and some insisting that a civilian presence is absolutely necessary for adequate security control too.

Personally I'm of the mind that the most reasonable request in a negotiation would be for Israel to be allowed to have some security provisions specifically along the border itself, like observations posts, or the way American bases might be present in certain sensitive areas abroad, as well as a defensive treaty that allows Israel the freedom of movement for troops and authority to defend the eastern border if there's ever like, a foreign army marching on it with hostile intentions toward Israel, or the Palestinians as well.

3025,"&gt;why the rejection of so many border lines because they're ""indefensible""?

There are several reasons at play, which I'll try to lay down briefly since I'm probably typing too much as it is. First of all, one of the main barriers for the 2SS to begin with is mutual distrust. In the middle-east generally, and in this conflict particularly, there are few people who think that signing a peace treaty, which is ultimately just a promise made by two leaders, means that eternal peace has been achieved and nobody would attack or plot against the other any longer. Regimes can change, especially autocratic ones, treaties can be broken, subterfuge can be attempted. This is especially true in regards to any peace deal which has been made between Israel and unelected, unpopular Arab dictators - it wasn't made between the peoples, relations weren't normalized, and polling shows that a large percentage or the majority of the Arab street does not consider any agreement signed between their dictators and Israel to be valid in their eyes, with many expressing support for renewed hostilities in the liberation of Palestine ( 48' borders ). 

There are even regular calls in the parliaments of both Egypt and Jordan to just casually 'cancel' the treaties or parties that advocate renewed conflict with Israel, and this is just what I can find from a quick Google search, but it is not out of the ordinary for those keeping track of middle-eastern politics: [1](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4418907,00.html), [2](https://www.haaretz.com/1.5022301), [3](https://www.haaretz.com/1.5022301), [4](https://www.timesofisrael.com/jordanian-parliament-demands-ban-on-gas-imports-from-israel/), [5](https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Jordan-Israel-peace-treaty-under-threat-Jordanian-parliament-speaker-604689), [6](https://www.jewishpress.com/news/middle-east/jordan/amman-parliament-urges-government-to-reconsider-jordan-israel-peace-treaty/2019/08/19/), [7](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-politics-expulsion/egypt-parliament-expels-mp-for-dining-with-israeli-ambassador-idUSKCN0W42FE).

Everything which happens in the Middle-east can change at a moment's notice of a popular revolution or renewed Pan-Arab zeal, and in addition to that, there's the threat of unaffiliated militants groups infiltrating places to ferment terrorism, which Israelis generally do not think the PA would be competent enough to stop or root out even if they trust them to do so ( To be fair, most Palestinians think the PA is very incompetent and corrupt themselves ). I wouldn't say Hezbollah is outside the scope of Palestine, considering the majority of their propaganda is centered around championing the Palestinian cause and being part of the resistance axis of liberating Palestine from Israel's existence, which means there are potential sympathizers to be recruited, and the same goes for Iran which funds Hezbollah. Furthermore, regimes such as Iran's or Syria's could always try to pressure future Jordanian or Egyptian regimes to collaborate with them in undermining Israel.

And although Israel did win the war in 1948, it was far from guaranteed, and not without cost. The Arab nations had by no means drafted even so much as half of a quarter of their populace in the war effort, they had very bad communication and conflicts of cooperation at the time, and there were certainly some moments of luck for Israel too. A similar war today would probably be more devastating than it was in 1948, and Israel would not necessarily have the upper hand despite all the technological advantages - In recent years the USA has been supplying Egypt, Saudi Arabia and so on with equally advanced equipment, and the Gulf states buy even more of it than Israel does. In addition, all of Israel's enemies have access to modern missiles and bombs, and Israel's defense systems can only intercept so much. While they have vast territories and can always spread out to avoid Israeli attacks, Israel today is just as much as a tiny, urban sitting duck as it was in 1948, except back then there were hardly any missiles involved. It's understandable that even if victory was the outcome, obviously no Israeli wants to relive the 1948 war, with every single place under attack and barrages of missiles raining down day and night too. 

&gt;does the Israeli general public not understand Palestinians just want East Jerusalem as their capital?

They do, but some have religious reasons, nationalistic reasons, and so forth to oppose even that. I've heard a lot of people citing security reasons - The fear that again, the Palestinian government would utterly fail ( deliberately or otherwise ) to root out radical activities in their sovereign side, and that in turn it would mean a suicide bombing or attack on Israel in western Jerusalem coming out of east Jerusalem every single day, reminiscent of the second Intifida. This would be the main secular argument in opposition that I'm hearing.

&gt;Would secular, centrist, and left-wing Israelis be ok if Palestinians got the Muslim Quarter of the Old City and the Temple Mount including the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque while Israel got all the other quarters of the city plus the Wailing Wall?

Yes, though some centrists might wish for the Temple Mount specifically ( Not the mosques, but the courtyard ) would be moreso under some kind of joint custody since it's the most important historical and religious site in Judaism, and not so much distinctly Muslims as the mosques themselves are. ( Historically the grounds of the Temple Mount itself were built and paved by King Herod ).

&gt;**Would Israelis find it more agreeable if Jerusalem, or at least just the Old City, was made an international city administered by the UN with freedom of movement for all peoples?

No, the Israeli public doesn't trust the UN any more than they do the Palestinian Authority. Which is pretty logical, since UN peacekeepers have been known to stand idly by during massacres, civilian conflicts, and generally not show too much initiative in going above and beyond the call of duty, and for the UN secretary-general, it would just be another place out of many to 'manage' and solve any attack that occurs in retrospect, as opposed to the Israeli government which would naturally be far more strict and spend 24/7 of their time worrying exclusively about the stability of the Israeli part.",Israel,/r/europe/comments/f54wia/israel_fears_eu_member_states_set_to_recognize/fiop60d/,Pingerim,1582587764

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtsenthebung

According to the German Judges Act, a judge can be removed from office according to Section 30 of the German Judges Act (DRiG).

(1) A lifetime judge or a temporary judge can only do so without his written consent

  in proceedings about the judge's charge (Article 98.2 and 5 GG)  
     in judicial disciplinary proceedings,  
     in the interest of the administration of justice (§ 31 DRiG),  
     when changing the court organization in Germany (§ 32 DRiG)  

transferred to another office or removed from office.

(2) The transfer or removal from office - except in the case of paragraph 1 No. 4 - can only be given on the basis of a legally binding judicial decision.

(3) It is equivalent to transfer if a judge who holds several judicial posts is removed from office.

&gt;That flawed nomination method is based on spain method so why no one is criticising spain ?

As I said, nomination is only part of the process. And in a such system of checks and balances, one part can make up for the flaws of another. We always have to look at the complete system and see to what results all the processes combined lead to.

&gt;People didnt vote expecting getting shitty reforms, they believed they voted on someone who will do proper reforms. I dont see how people can change anything since no one other political offers to do proper reforms, at most political parties are offering to restore status quo by reversing changes back to how it was before. 

I'd say, when all parties fail, you need a strong civil society to take matters into its own hands. Sure there are at least some people with no ties to certain parties but with enough expertise to express critique and propose better solutions.

Also, I never specifically referenced sucrose. I stated that sugars, plural, are useful to your body in a survival situation. I directly implied more than just sucrose, and if you had basic knowledge as you imply you would instantly have thought of glucose and its importance in the body. 

And besides, you're still ignoring the whole context of this conversation.

When the 38yo started to feel really ill (he's in intensive care now) he went to hospital, but as he only had fever he was sent home - in the meantime, he infected several hospital personnel, who in turn may have infected other patients. Then a few hours later he began having respiratory problems, went back to the hospital, and was admitted and tested for the coronavirus, which sparked tests on all people he had been in contact with, and isolation of Codogno (his hometown) and neighbouring towns.

In Veneto it seems to have started from a bar in Vo Euganeo, where the first victim (pensioner who played cards there) lived.

3180,"&gt;I mean, tbf (especially cross-country) skiing has a completely different status in Norway than it has in any other country.

It has a relatively similar status in at least Sweden and Finland. 

&gt;while for most other countries it's more the odd guy/gal that decides to try something ""exotic"".

There are a bunch of countries where it is a normal sport, not particularly ""exotic"". This can be seen in the results as well, while the Nordic countries + Russia are dominant, there are a lot of other countries that have good skiers too. Looking at the olympic medal list: Italy, Germany, Czechia, Switzerland, Estonia, Poland, Austria. It's pretty obviously tied to the amount of snow a country gets, haha. 

But Norway is the only country where it is *the* most popular sport (except football). Both Sweden and Finland have hockey as well. So you might have a point. 

But I think it has much more to do with political/economic investment into skiing. Especially when you compare Norway to other top performing countries in the sport (Sweden, Finland, Russia, etc.). 

---

In terms of public interest (watching TV and so on) skiing is pretty damn big in Sweden (football, hockey, and skiing are the most popular sports). I don't think there's a big difference in Norway in that regard. Norwegians are most likely way more personally active in the sport though, stereotypically being very outdoorsy people and what not.

3195,"They said that these words ""bamboozle"" them.

They also said, ""This doesn't mean anything either, marinara is a pizza."" Which I thought was funny because the sentence contradicts itself. It says ""it doesn't mean anything, it means this"". How does it not mean anything and mean something at the same time?

That is HUMOROUS.

I was pointing out the HUMOR of the statement. And clarifying that yes, we know you don't call it that. But we do. And there's no reason it should bamboozle you. The words have an evolutionary process of becoming what they are here. Marinara means something in Italy... it's a pizza covered in sauce. Well here we would say ""oh hey, what's that pizza with the sauce on it?"" ""It's a pizza marinara."" ""Oh can I get some of that sauce on the side? Some of that marinara sauce?"" ""Sure, here you go, some sauce of the pizza marinara on the side for you!"" ""Why thank you. Hey, can I get more of that sauce from the... oh why am I using so many words? The sauce, the marinara sauce, yeah can I get some more?"" ""Sure thing, marinara sauce coming right up!""

Just as you're NOT saying  ""dumb Americans no kno how things call"". I'm also not saying ""dumb Italians..."". I'm just highlighting the humor and the language because well, language is a topic I rather enjoy.

After meeting hundreds of people who crossed the Schengen border without documents, I've learned there is a huge difference between refugees and people who are illegally entering Europe for the purpose of better economic situation.

Refugees are those who seek safety and shelter in the nearest safe country that's willing to accept them. 

Going on a planned, arranged trip to a country of your choosing that you find to better suit your personal needs has nothing to do with being an asylum seeker, no matter how risky and dangerous it is.

Taste is quite subjective. What you consider bad taste, some people just consider a cheese children's play. But that gives you no justifications to claim racial discrimination of any sort.


&gt;I don't get why people feel like it's so important for people to do blackface in Europe...

That's irrelevant to your argument and I'm not going to comment


&gt; It's not a tradition, it's not an hommage, it's like dressing kids in auschwitz prisoner uniforms to bring awereness about the holocaust...

Again, it doesn't have to be important because it's not universally a touchy subject. Even the holocaust, a touchy subject, still doesn't mean dressing up kids to bring awareness or whatever is a negative/racist act.

3404,"&gt; Why not? When calculating the harm the USSR did to Latvia the historical committees IIRC calculated also the benefits of occupation. Economic stimulus and investments does not nullify other occupation aspects - otherwise, just as a hyperbolic example, Poles couldn't complain about the Nazis, just because they built military infrastructure (for their invasion of the USSR). 

Well, I had no problem with this consistency. Problem is that Crimea is treated as ""Ukranian"" territory only when bad stuff happens according to their view (after all for Russia it was just excavating on their soil). After all, nobody posts here how Russia builds infrastructure across Crimea basically for free for Ukraine. But when it is stuff which can be blamed on Russia, people become principled on ""it is Ukranian soil"" and thus looting.

&gt; At the mean time, if we look at Americans, you're seeing a large part of the population recognizing the criminality of people like Colombus in his participation into genocide and enslavement of native Americans. The trend, in my opinion, is shifting towards recognition of past crimes and not viewing them through relativism (i.e. it's okay because it was the norm at the time OR just an outright refusal to see crimes for what they are), but seeing it from a, sort of, ''consequentialist'' lense (i.e. it wasn't okay then and not okay now, and hence we also should seek ways how to repay the exploitation of other peoples that has directly led to the world being as it is now). I mean, at least in the West.

Well, I'm pretty sure, most Europeans also think that. The problem is that the general knowledge or interest doesn't go further than ""oh yeah, it happened, that was bad, but it was the past"". That is why, if we somehow could magically stop Russia from looting, nothing to the other countries would happen.

&gt; I am a 100% sure Churchils name, as time goes, will be more and more tied to his actions against e.g. Bengal, as those who suffered (or their descendants) get a louder voice.

Sure, maybe in India. But I doubt it will somehow change the perception in Europe. It's not like European care particularly much about others, except when it is convenient. In the future, his importance will simply wane even more, because WW2 can't be ""less than 100 years ago"" forever.

&gt; I'm genuinely not the best example as I'm rather leftist in my views in critique about the neo-colonialism of countries like Britain, France and, especially, the US. If you're talking about the average Latvian, however - you are right, they do care about Russian crimes more. I just don't see how it fits into what we're talking about?

Well, because Latvians and by extension other Eastern Europeans were the only Europeans who really suffered under colonialism/imperialism. All others either didn't really have an empire, or they were the colonizers and imperialists. There aren't really enough people who would care enough to complain about the Western European colonizers, except for getting some sort of browny points. And most Eastern Europeans don't and probably won't care about what Western Europeans did to others. Thus there won't be any dealing Europe's colonial legacies with it tomorrow.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/f8o24v/russia_has_looted_more_than_a_million_artifacts/fin94bw/,CDWEBI,1582558610

3500,"&gt; Problem is that it's only looting in the context that it is still Ukrainian territory. I mean, you can have that opinion, but then, if one were to be consistent, one would have to regard all the Russian infrastructure projects in Crimea as Russia directly building stuff for free for Ukraine.

Why not? When calculating the harm the USSR did to Latvia the historical committees IIRC calculated also the benefits of occupation. Economic stimulus and investments does not nullify other occupation aspects - otherwise, just as a hyperbolic example, Poles couldn't complain about the Nazis, just because they built military infrastructure (for their invasion of the USSR). 

&gt; Because in the end, the West only mistreated ""some savages not in Europe"".

Well, that's what those we (internally) fight against think - which is why, as I said, this process is still ongoing. At the mean time, if we look at Americans, you're seeing a large part of the population recognizing the criminality of people like Colombus in his participation into genocide and enslavement of native Americans. The trend, in my opinion, is shifting towards recognition of past crimes and not viewing them through relativism (i.e. it's okay because it was the norm at the time OR just an outright refusal to see crimes for what they are), but seeing it from a, sort of, ''consequentialist'' lense (i.e. it wasn't okay then and not okay now, and hence we also should seek ways how to repay the exploitation of other peoples that has directly led to the world being as it is now). I mean, at least in the West.

&gt; Similar how, people like to bring up the fact that USSR caused or enhanced famines, but somehow never do it with the UK and India where several famines were enhanced by the UK, so that several 10s of millions people died (each time).

I am a 100% sure Churchils name, as time goes, will be more and more tied to his actions against e.g. Bengal, as those who suffered (or their descendants) get a louder voice.

&gt; For example, you as a Latvian, probably have a much worse historical opinion about Russia than, let's say, UK, simply because the UK only abused people who are far away and not relevant to you. Nor do you probably care that the US abuses various countries around the world till this day, by either sustaining or creating war zones, after all you aren't really affected by it.

I'm genuinely not the best example as I'm rather leftist in my views in critique about the neo-colonialism of countries like Britain, France and, especially, the US. If you're talking about the average Latvian, however - you are right, they do care about Russian crimes more.

They don't understand the political messages, the subtle references or in this case the mockery of political correctness. In fact they forget all about them after a week, at least I did. I have never memorised a single float, so how could these things have indoctrinated me? 

I ended up as left leaning, not because I was indoctrinated by Carnaval but because my dad is very left leaning. The same will apply to these kids.

Yes, mostly the elderly, with pre-existing conditions are more likely to result in cessation of life functions. 

""Patients who reported no pre-existing (""comorbid"") medical conditions had a case fatality rate of 0.9%."". Remember this is the overall rate, by age it varies quite a bit.

If you're a healthy person, between 9 and 39 years of age, with no pre existing conditions your chances of dying are 0.2%.

3803,"&gt; Why would I say such idiotic lie? Diversity in not bad or good in itself, religious approach to it is, when you allow heinous crimes to continue and spread, this is the problem here, authorities knowing and allowing it “for diversity”. 

To accuse authorities of allowing crimes to happen is quite messed up. You say diversity is ""not bad or good in itself"" but you claim it's the reason why people have allowed the sexual abuse of children to happens.

How can diversity be good, in your view? 

&gt; We know from other articles and accounts ethnic and religious hatred towards hosts was and is at the bottom of this, victims, often 12-13yo were “white infidel whores” for them, ca 19 000 a year and who knows the real number. 

There was religious hatred by Muslims, therefore diversity is a religion?

&gt; There are most likely other Muslims who don’t do that but we know accounts of Pakistani girls and women from the area defending rapists and blaming these “white whores”. 

That is bad. But what does that have to do with diversity being a religion? Nothing.

He literaly was reffered to as Polish by other Germans, specificaly Sarmation which was the ethno national identity of Poles.

We don't know if he wrote in Polish just that no Polish wrighting of his survived but Polish was not a common language to write in back then, even Jan Dlugosz wrote in Latin. so this in not unusual for a Pole at this time.  His family actually had a feud with the King about his uncles appointment as bishopric of Warma. Yet his uncle served as the advisor to 3 consecutive Kings, and both him and his uncle supported closer integration of Prussia and the Rest of Poland. Not only did Copernicus command Polish troops in the siege of Olsztyn, after the way he repopulated the region with Mazovian settlers. He did so much for Poland, even his final publication has the coat of arms of Poland, Krakow, and Lithuania on it. 

We dont know if he wrote in Polish just that no Polish writhing of his survived but Polish was not a common language to write in back then, even Jan Dlugosz wrote in Latin. so this in not unusual for a Pole at this time. 

As for culturaly German, do you imagine a bunch of people running around in lederhosen and buckets of sourkrout? Poland was a multicultrual state, dont forget that. Every region was influenced by some culture from different people. 

And for you to try to portray him as nihter Polish or German but then say Dansk was not a Polish city untill after the 20th century is disengenious, although German was the dominent language Polish was still widely spoken there and the Danzigers did not want to be seperated from Poland, even after the partions they tried to be reincorporated into Poland but Prussia would not alow it. The archetecture wasnt even German but built by Dutch Architects. Goldwasser the famous ""German"" gold vodka from Gdansk was actually invented by a Dutch immigrant. How much more multi cultural can you get? A Dutch guy making vodka in Poland for Polish kings. So its fair to say it was actually a Prussian - Polish city.

It is nothing like Carlmagne, by this time Poland had been its own country for half a milenium, unlike when France was just beginning to emerge from the Frankish Empire. He was related to the Polish nobility, he was ethically mixed German Polish ancestry, but as a nationality, how can you deny it was Polish? 

If you are born in a country, and you have ancestral ties to that country, and you speak that countries language, and you faithfully act in that countries intrest your whole life, how can you not be of that nationality? Germany had nothing to do with his life.

Two points:

* The WHO has not recommended cutting off travel to and from China as a whole.

* Realistically, if the virus spreads throughout China, I doubt that it can be contained.  China is just too large.  Like, drawing a quarantine around China as a whole seems unlikely to me to be very effective *in the long term*.  Sure, it might reduce Italy's chances of picking someone up in the immediate term, but point is, the battle line that matters is the one around the quarantined places in China -- if the world loses there, it doesn't have the means to cut off China as a whole.

Some decades back, there was a Royal Navy Sea Harrier -- another vertical-landing-capable plane -- pilot who got himself lost, was almost out of fuel, thought that he was going to have to ditch at sea, but then saw a Spanish cargo ship and [landed on top of a cargo container on the ship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm-_Ga6nms).

That number is simply misleadingly calculated dividing the number deaths by the number of reported cases, but the fact is that until now those are mostly Chinese numbers which could be affected by several biases. South Korea and Italy have been doing extensive tests and because of that are catching cases quicker and getting lower fatality rates. The 2% was a hunch based on early data, but will need to be updated.

Furthermore, it seems people take that number as meaning you have a 2% chance of dying if you caught it, which could be wronger. That number doesn't take into account asymptomatic people (as they aren't usually tested) and, again, doesn't count the cases that pass as the common flu (again lack of testing). Besides, it doesn't seem to affect everyone the same way, either, so one needs to account for several other factors too. Seriously, 2% only helps to fearmonger and most of the times there's really no point in touting it, even worst to start an argument with it.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/f8fsly/austria_stops_train_from_italy_due_to_suspected/filrsm0/,DelightfulGoo,1582508773

https://thediplomat.com/2020/02/will-the-united-states-develop-a-new-type-of-nuclear-warhead/ 

&gt;The NNSA’s budget release describe the W93 warhead program for the first time in its budget release in a single sentence: “The W93 warhead program was recently endorsed by the Nuclear Weapons Council and the Deputy Secretary of Defense to support the U.S. Strategic Command-required replacement for the Navy’s Trident II D5 submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM).”

-

&gt; One concern with the W93 designation is that the designation itself suggests something grander than a modification, or “mod,” like the recently fielded W76-2, which is a primary-only, lower-yield derivative of the W76-1 warhead. Calling the new warhead the W93 may imply an all-new design.

https://www.defensedaily.com/planned-w93-warhead-will-contribute-new-u-k-nuke-dod-officials-say/nuclear-modernization/

&gt; As first reported on Tuesday by *Defense Daily*, W93 will begin life as a ballistic-missile warhead, but will be designed for rapid upgrades that would allow the Navy to quickly shift it to other types of sea-based weapons, according to a source familiar with the proposal for the weapon.

4254,"&gt;E European immigration has been falling for a couple of years already and the decrease will continue with legal Brexit.

The *rate* of inward migration is falling - in absolute numbers it is still positive. If the GBP/EUR rate holds close to 1.20, or even breaks above it, I would if anything expect inward migration from the EU to *increase* from current levels, despite Brexit. Labour-based migration is generally from countries with lower wages to countries with higher wages, and the UK continues to have one of the higher post-tax average salaries in Europe, and a more flexible labour market. If you look at the years when inward migration from the EU was highest in the 2010-2018 years, it correlates quite well with the period when GBP was at its strongest vs the EUR.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The UK does not have any special relationship with non-commonwealth countries it would be very difficult for a Japanese worker or a Mexican worker to come to the UK

Hypothetically if they are fluent English speakers the difficulty in being employed in the UK is the same as any other nationality, assuming an equivalent skillset. The whole point of the new migration system is that it doesn't prioritize ""special relationships"" with certain countries and disregards an applicant's nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;After the EU the most immigrants come from South Asia. It would be the most convenient place from which the UK labour pool can be replenished.

The UK Labour pool has not decreased since 2016 - both absolute numbers of EU and non-EU immigrants have gone up, just the *rate* has increased amongst the latter group and decreased amongst the former group (whilst still remaining positive).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And they will definitely not go through all the hassle to replace seasonal berry pickers and labourers.

These jobs will likely be filled by making exemptions to the salary threshold rules and language fluency rules, with migrants classified as ""seasonal workers"". Generally seasonal workers are only employed for a few months or so, before being required to depart - thus it is quite likely they will come from the same places they already come from (A8 accession nations + Romania and Bulgaria), and if those numbers are insufficient, from other nations on the fringe of the EU which have regular cheap air travel to the UK (e.g. Morocco, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Turkey, Moldavia, Ukraine). There aren't cheap flights to/from any airport in a South Asian city to the UK so it is impractical to get workers from so far afield at short notice, and given that flight costs from that far can be 5x as much from the ""EU fringe"" countries I mentioned, many prospective seasonal migrants would likely expect a significant proportion of their costs (rent, transport) to be paid for it to be economically worthwhile. UK employers generally don't like to pay those costs, so I expect it will be far more convenient to recruit from locations where the migrant's transportation costs are substantially lower. I suppose you could get cases of South Asian people who migrated to the UK recently on a family visa (these may not remain post-reforms) who are ""temporarily"" provided access to the labour market.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;since we will have borders separating us from the child buggering rings in the UK I don't have a problem.

4264,"Yeah, tell me about it lol. There's straight up no end to all the stuff they try to pull. To add on to the previous comment, they had a frontman of a known neonazi band be one of their candidates for parliament. There are also straight up people who posted stuff on facebook where they praised Hitler, saying that he was a (paraphrasing) man with his heart in the right place, who tried to end alcoholism, give people jobs and whatnot.

If you're interested, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eAQp6D0onk) is worth a watch, particularly from around the 13:40 mark. The young bald man beating his chest is one of the most well-known party members. He was removed from parliament for some racist comments in a radio discussion. He, along with other party members, used to deny the holocaust (or maybe not flat out deny, but they had comments doubting it) and then they defended themselves by saying that they're not historians, they can't have an opinion on every single historical event.

Furthermore, their current spokesman is another neonazi singer, there are videos of him starting songs by yelling ""Sieg heil, sieg heil!"" and such.

Recently (within the last week), a 4-5 or so years old video of one of their members became popular from when he was campaining for some local government position. In the video, he talks about how at 18 years old, the Gypsies (which is a word they use, it's generally seen as somewhat derogatory in Slovakia, though it's not always the case; the PC word is Roma) in their village could only go as far as the small river that divided the village, if they tried to go further, the nazi party member would push them off the bridge. Mind you, this isn't something he was hiding, or some secret camera or whatever, he's saying this vile stuff in front of his voters in the town square.

And the party leader, Marian Kotleba, is no saint either. Upon first getting elected to parliament in 2016, one of his first propositions was a minute of silence for Jozef Tiso, who was the president of the WWII Slovak state. They view him as the first president of an independent slovak country, and I guess that's right, but current Slovakia is not a historical continuation (I think that's the term for it, I'm not sure though) of the state. Anyway, [this](https://plus.rozhlas.cz/sites/default/files/uploader/jozef_tiso_berlin_181031-203027_lac.jpg) is Jozef Tiso with Hitler. He agreed to collaborate with Nazi Germany which resulted in about 70,000 people being deported from Slovakia to concentration camps.

During Kotleba's time as a head of the Banská Bystrica region (I can't translate the word), he used to put up black flags on the building of the office on August 29th, the day of the Slovak National Uprising. He's not only a nazi, he also can't accomplish anything. While he was the head of the region, he employed lots of his close friends and family, which was something he was campaining against. He also promised to give Gypsies about 15,000 jobs in his ""Pickaxes and shovels"" program, but only employed 90 people... for 3 months. Currently he's facing criminal charges for the 1488€ donations, among other things (I believe the donation value is the main reason, but obviously there is more proof). We should hear the verdict a couple days after the election, so he may actually be in prison soon.

However, this doesn't change the fact that there is potentially a possibility that they might form a coalition with the current ruling party Smer-SD (social democrats), which has been the strongest party for some 12 years. Many members of Smer have had ties to mafia and so on and while they keep saying that they wouldn't team up with Kotleba, nobody really believes them. There have also been ties between Smer members and the [murder of Ján Kuciak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_J%C3%A1n_Kuciak). One of the most bizarre connections are that the current party leader and at the time Prime Minister Robert Fico lived across the hall of a well-known criminal in a very luxurious apartment. The criminal was one of the main people behind the murder, there's an ongoing process against him right now.

I'm not naming most of the people because I believe that they don't deserve it. I got a bit carried away, but honestly, this whole Kotleba situation is very upsetting to me. It's not just that they are popular, but I hate the fact that people either straight up deny that they're nazis, or they don't care. One of the main reasons people voted for Kotleba before was that he was the against-the-system candidate. However, in the last 4 years, they voted with Smer several times and many people accept are okay with the fact that Kotleba wouldn't mind forming a coalition with Smer, which people defend by saying that ""Kotleba would keep Smer on a short leash"".",Slovakia,/r/europe/comments/f8f8al/the_real_wall_against_the_extremism_in_slovak/filims6/,SnoopySVK,1582502444

4304,"They didn't win it outright so much as give the two major parties a kick in the teeth. They're tied at 37 TD's with Fianna Fail (though technically Fianna Fail has 38 due to the Ceann Comhairle currently belonging to FF, but he only votes on to break a tie). A party needs at least 80 to form a majority government, or organise a confidence and supply agreement with another party to make up the numbers and have a minority, which is how Fine Gael ran the last government with FF propping them up.

The problem is FF and FG both swore off forming a government with SF before the election. Add in that SF ran on a campaign of being an alternative to the back and forth of FF and FG (which has dominated Irish politics almost since the very beginning), and the three parties a but deadlocked.

Should also note that it'd be in SF's best interest for another election soon, to run more candidates (in many constituencies SF candidates got more than double first preference of the minimum requirement, where as FF and FG candidates struggled to make it on the first count).",,/r/europe/comments/f8c7vm/exit_poll_of_the_hamburg_regional_elections_spd/fil5399/,irishgoblin,1582493825
4305,"Caution, controversial: The Green party's core stance is eco-friendly politics. Now what this is is already open to interpretation. For example, the capital of BW, governed by the Green Party, Stuttgart, having a Green mayor, is Germany's most polluted city. 

Apart from them being eco-friendly, the Green party is what you call ""morally flexible"". They have no clear (or opposing stances) to different topics, and when it comes to taking responsibility (power), the environmentalism is sometimes the only stance they won't give up, everything else will be in the hands of their coalition partner. So, apart from the more right-wing CDU, the Greens are becoming the new big left-leaning party of ""nothing"". ""Nothing"" in this case means that you can always kind of identify with them and you can vote for them because they are not clearly ""against"" your own causes. I hope you get my point.

Also they're doing a good job marketing their top personnel to a very wide liberal-leaning part of the population. So they might basically steal votes from every party, CDU, SPD, Linke, even FDP, except the AfD, because the the Greens are like the AfD's construction of an arch-nemesis.

Finally, some kitchen psychology: the Greens stand for ""saving the world"". And Germans like to vote for ""saving the world"" because it seems like the right thing to do, with all the guilt and everything, you know? And thinking as simplistic as that, who wouldn't wanna vote for ""saving the world"" except for some FDP ""I just want it all for myself"" narcissists and all the AfD ""I wanna see the world burn"" misanthropists?",,/r/europe/comments/f8c7vm/exit_poll_of_the_hamburg_regional_elections_spd/fil53k3/,AJL912-aber,1582493830

4408,"&gt;French doctrine calls for two carriers.

It was decided to rely on just one for the foreseeable future. So, no, it obviously doesn't.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They just can't afford it.

France and the UK have [very similar military expenditures](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.CD?locations=FR-GB). They just use them differently, because, as I pointed out, they are different countries, with different future prospects.

A couple billion euros are not a negligible amount, but it's not something a country like France inherently cannot afford. If France actually deemed two carriers to be of the utmost necessity for the defense of its vital interests, it would have been decided to build two. It was assessed that that money would be best employed elsewhere in the French military. It's as simple as that.

The land-based component of French nuclear deterrence was dismantled following the collapse of the USSR and the Warsaw Pact for the exact same reason: because it lost its purpose, and wasn't deemed cost-effective enough anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

Regardless, two carriers (and their respective and mandatory escort flotillas) are always better than one. Four are better than two, eight are better than four. But given a specific budget, countries make cost-effective choices, based on what they assess their actual needs will be. That's rather... logical?

The US could easily field 20 supercarriers. But they don't, because that would be an utterly stupid waste of money, given their actual needs. A dozen is already pushing it, and they only field that many because it's a doctrinal legacy of the Cold War, because a federal law forbids having fewer than 11 (if memory serves me right), and because the defense sector (that includes both the military industry and military personnel+family) is intertwined with the US economy to such a great extent that downsizing is economically problematic.

And for your information, the decision for the UK to build two of them may not be as sensible as you seem to believe. It has been [highly controversial](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/aircraft-carrier-defence-budget-hms-queen-elizabeth-royal-navy), not because of their sheer cost, but because of what their actual usefulness and purpose will be in the decades to come.

Now, maybe that was the right choice, maybe it wasn't. Only time will tell. But down the line, France and the UK simply reached different conclusions regarding their needs.",France,/r/europe/comments/f7gupm/charles_de_gaulle_french_navy_flagship_in_cyprus/fikstei/,Orravan_O,1582486619

4418,"&gt; This is the most comprehensive table of transmission that we have

So most people that died are......old people with pre-existing conditions? 

&gt; You will notice that the flu does NOT usually have a 0.2% mortality rate (the rate for the youngest age group), let alone higher numbers.

look at the total number of cases.... you cant infer shit from that. 

&gt;Well, they are the only numbers we've got that are reliable and not guess work.

and theyre useless. 

&gt;And sure, China might have a lot of smokers, but did they have similar levels of mortality for the regular flu? I somehow doubt it.

its beyond your ability to comprehend that a different virus might affect people differently? and this one will fuck up people harder than an average flu IF they fucked themselves up with a couple decades of smoking? all this means is that they functionally died to their pre existing condition, not the flu. just because smoking is popular doesnt mean these people arent ""sick"". 

Also ""somehow i doubt it""? you were asked to provide evidence for your claims. Drop your claim or provide evidence, its simple. 

&gt;It is a mixed bag. There are some issues (like wet markets and spitting) but also others where it does better. Have you ever traveled to China? Sick people were wearing masks even before this and it is the only place in which I saw elevators being disinfected during the day (again, not during this pandemic).

its not a mixed bag. those masks people wear do practically nothing, an elevator being disinfected is also irrelevant - and this type of shit only happens in the main cities anyway where most people dont even live, and spitting/wet markets are the least of chinas hygiene issues.

In the study published Feb. 18 in the China CDC Weekly, researchers found a death rate from COVID-19 to be around 2.3% in mainland China. That's much higher than the death rate linked to flu, which is typically around 0.1% in the U.S., according to The New York Times. ""

Erected in the 13th century, Ksiaz castle was home to many noble families such as the mighty House of Hochberg. Between 1509 and 1941, the Hochberg’s expanded the castle and significantly contributed to its splendor. During World War II the castle was taken over by the occupying German forces. Under their reign, numerous historic chambers were destroyed. The Nazis created a system of tunnels underneath the castle, in which the function still remains a mystery. Recently the Ksiaz castle made news as a rumor of a lost Nazi gold train was believed to be buried in the vicinity of the castle.  

After systematic looting committed by the German occupiers and later by the Red Army, in 1952 the renovation work was undertaken to restore the Ksiaz Castle to its previous grandeur.

Today, visitors can admire the majesty of numerous chambers, terraces and surrounding gardens. The underground tunnel is also available to the public.

4631,"Yeah, no, that’s not how it was.

Czechoslovakia was formed in 1918 with the collapse of Austria-Hungary, as a union between Czechs and Slovaks (Czechs lived predominantly in Bohemia, Moravia, and a small part of Silesia (the rest of Silesia was part of the German Empire) all of which being part of Cisleithania), whereas historically Slovak-speaking parts of Austria-Hungary belonged to Transleithania, aka the Lands of the Crown of St Stephen. 

Czechoslovakia existed as a sovereign state until 1938, when Germany annexed parts of Bohemia and Moravia that were predominantly German-speaking, which was known at the time as the Sudetenland. The Sudeten Germans had lived in the Czech lands for centuries but were unable to join Germany or German-Austria following WWI (the newly created Republic of German-Austria claimed German-speaking parts of Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, but were unable to hold onto them). After 1939, most of Czechoslovakia became administered by Germany as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (Reichsprotektorat Böhmen und Mähren), and also separately as the independent Slovak Republic, which was an Axis country and ally of Germany.

In 1948, Czechoslovakia became a communist country following elections, and in 1956 joined the Warsaw Pact. Despite this, Czechoslovakia (along with East Germany) was the best Warsaw Pact country to live in and had better quality of life than most of the Eastern Bloc nations. Czechoslovakia would remain communist until the Velvet Revolution in 1989. Since 1993 Slovakia and the Czech Republic have been independent of each other. Both countries later joined the EU (in 2004) and NATO (Czech Republic in 1999 and Slovakia in 2004).

Technically speaking, Czechoslovakia between 1948-1989 was a sovereign country and was never part of the Soviet Union. That being said, it was part of the Eastern Bloc and was a satellite state of the Soviet Union and maintained close relations. However, Czechoslovakia was invaded by most of the Warsaw Pact (excluding Romania and mostly excluding East Germany) during the Prague Spring in 1968, due to the Soviet Union viewing the reformist policies of Alexander Dubček as a threat.",Austria,/r/europe/comments/f84tm7/prague_czech_republic/fik4mgq/,Sturmgewehr_44,1582472636

4694,"&gt;What is exactly your argument or question, so we don't have to go through the explanation of complete economic processes one by one? Because that can take a while otherwise.

My point is asking those simple questions is to make you think about whole chain of events.

Every-time someone says ""companies makes shitload of profits"" or ""rich people make too much money"" they go further and ask what they do with that money.

Companies don't want to hoard money nor rich people, they want to invest that money because not investing that money means inflation loses. Those investments are directly jobs in economy.

Even the most annoying bloody rich man who uses golden paper in his toilet is best friend of poor people. Because someone has to make that paper, someone has to make those golden doors in his bedroom, someone has to create everything that rich man spends money on which gives work directly to people and well paid jobs in return those people buy themselves something good and this is how whole chain operates.

Case in point. US and China. Yes US income stayed mostly flat in last 30 years. IT is true. But thanks to Rich people in US Chinese took 500mln people out of poverty into some modern life. Those people now want products that US people sell.

Growth is very hard and confusing subject that is often taken by ideology instead of realism.

Best example of that is when people talk about jobs. Productivity is not important for them, amount of jobs is. To understand how stupid such line of thinking is you only need to use simple logic. If someone can be done by one person like creating 1l of water in bottle then 10 people working together would be better no if end product is same 1l.",,/r/europe/comments/f7f5ts/the_benefits_of_the_single_market_largely/fijv05t/,europemodsareshit2,1582464975

4850,"&gt;Explain to me how that is a joke. He called a work trip to the USSR a ""honeymoon"". The source you linked didn't even explain how that was a joke, in fact, it backed me up.

The fact he called it 'very strange'? It is quite obviously a joke.

It is also quite obvious from both your sources that Bernie recognized the flaws of the Soviet Union, but also recognized the things the Soviet Union did better then the US. Eg. Free healtcare, paid maternity leave, free education. All thing that Bernie advocates for, that is no secret.

From the article in The Hill:

&gt;Another person who accompanied Sanders on the trip, Howard Seaver, told the Post that he saw the visit as influential to the senator — an experience that showed him “the downside of the Soviet system” while shaping his views on social welfare and economic equality.

&gt;“I suspect that what Bernie saw in Russia probably affected his views that you see today, where he is not anti-free-enterprise or capitalism but he wants to have a safety net and give a fair shake to all, but certainly not to have a command economy we saw in the Soviet Union,” Seaver said.

From the Washington Post article:

&gt;“Let’s take the strengths of both systems,” he said upon completing the trip. “Let’s learn from each other.”

&gt;I think [Sanders] saw and we all saw the downside of the Soviet system,” Seaver said. “Yes, they may have had low-cost apartments, but things were very out of whack — there were food shortages, no political freedom. I suspect that what Bernie saw in Russia probably affected his views that you see today, where he is not anti-free-enterprise or capitalism but he wants to have a safety net and give a fair shake to all, but certainly not to have a command economy we saw in the Soviet Union.”

4897,"Boris Johnson’s Brexit team has been ordered to draw up plans to “get around” the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit withdrawal agreement so the prime minister can play hardball with Brussels over trade.

Officials in Taskforce Europe, run by Johnson’s EU negotiator David Frost, are working in secret on proposals to ensure that there do not need to be checks on goods passing from Britain to Northern Ireland.

They believe the new attorney-general, Suella Braverman, might have to give new legal advice to justify the move. Insiders say she was appointed because her predecessor Geoffrey Cox was not willing to countenance action that will be seen in Brussels as a breach of the exit agreement.

“There is deadly serious internal work going on about not obeying the Northern Ireland protocol,” a senior source said. “Taskforce Europe are looking into that. That’s why they had Suella put in there.”

The details emerged as Frost plans this week to spell out Britain’s demands for a trade deal with Brussels, insisting on the same rights as Canada. Officials have not ruled out an attempt to try to claw back money from the EU divorce bill if the EU will not play ball.

Johnson’s Brexit war cabinet will meet on Tuesday to sign off the plans, which will be published online on Thursday and laid out in parliament.

In a move that will delight Eurosceptics, the “mandate” for trade talks with the US will be published the following week, allowing the UK to negotiate with the EU and the US at the same time — something they believe will give Britain more leverage.

A source accused the EU of dragging its feet: “The EU seem distracted by other issues. The new plan is for them to approve their mandate on February 25, but it’s anyone’s guess whether they will.”

With the first round of formal negotiations due to start on March 2, a Downing Street source taunted Brussels: “As a wise man once said, please don’t waste this time.”

That was a deliberate echo of the words used by Donald Tusk, the former EU council president, to put pressure on Britain last year.",EU federalist - Lisbon to Vladivostok,/r/europe/comments/f8725y/brexit_team_seeks_to_evade_irish_sea_checks_on/fijjfix/,le_br1t,1582450801

* It is not the place of Hungary to change the West liberalism, but it is its duty to voice and fight for its identity
* The EU will not be able to compete unless a philosophical and practical solution will be found to encapsulate the 2 very different cultures and directions

What I like about this guy is that he stands for something, he has energy, conviction and pushes the things he believes in and trust to work long time, unlike the fainted Western European leaders saying whatever it takes to please the crowds and not upset anyone.

4981,"Kosovo's independence is not a recent event. I will summarize some main events through the past century to explain how the conflict started and how it ended. This is a long post.

Kosovo was defined as [part of northern Albania](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Kossovo) in the Encyclopedia Britannica in 1911 (even though Albania did not officially exist as a country). Kosovo was the center of Albanian nationalism and fight for independence from the Ottoman Empire, with many revolts in Drenica, [Kacanik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_revolt_of_1910) and [Skopje](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_revolt_of_1912). The Albanians won after the 1912 rebellion in Skopje and made demands to the Ottoman Empire. As soon as the Ottoman Empire agreed to recognize Albania's autonomy in August of 1912, a coalition consisting of Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece, with the backing of Russia attacked the European part of the Ottoman Empire in September of 1912. Albanians were caught between this, and virtually all of the land that was promised to Albania in August was occupied by December of 1912. In 1913, in the Conference of London, the Albanian territory was split between the Balkan coalition. Kosovo was split between Serbia and Montenegro, even though it had overwhelmingly Albanian majority. Albania's independence got recognized, but with only 40% of the territory that had at least 70% Albanian population.

After occupying Kosovo, Serbia decided to ethnically cleanse and colonize it. Some noteworthy events are the [massacres of Albanians in 1913](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_of_Albanians_in_the_Balkan_Wars), [population exchange and colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_colonisation_of_Kosovo) in three big waves, 1918 to 1941, 1945 to 1966 and then 1990 to 1999.

In 1941, Kosovo became [part of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Albania). In 1944, Albania and Yugoslavia signed an agreement to give Kosovo to Albania if the communists win WW2. Tito felt like he was breaking a promise until the split between Yugoslavia and USSR, and Albania sided with the USSR. This made Albania enemy. Yugoslavia did not want to give territory to an enemy, and this is how Kosovo remained in Yugoslavia after the war.

Kosovo gained its current shape in [1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Yugoslav_Constitution), when it became a constitutive member of the Yugoslav federation and earned the right to veto decisions of Serbia's parliament for issues that weren't even related to Kosovo. Basically Serbia had 3 units, Serbia proper, Kosovo, and Vojvodina. All had equal power within Serbia.

In 1989, Kosovo's 1974 autonomy was suppressed illegally, since Kosovo did not agree to give up its autonomy. Its Albanian members of the parliament were simply dismissed and replaced by Serbs loyal to Milosevic, in an illegal act. Kosovo retaliated by [declaring independence in 1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Kosova) and running parallel institutions.  Serbia did not recognize it, but de facto Kosovo was independent. Serbia then sent its army and made the Albanian language illegal, closed the university, schools, everything else. It also beat random civilians, and it started to bring Serb colonists from Croatia and Bosnia. This all led to resistance, which eventually led to the [Kosovo war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War). 

In 1999, Serbia decided to expel every single Albanian from Kosovo and replace them by Serbs. This created a humanitarian catastrophe, and NATO decided to bomb Serbia. After the end of the war, Kosovo was put under UN administration and since 1999 it was de facto independent from Serbia again. In 2008 it officially declared independence, after Serbia refused to allow the population of Kosovo to hold a referendum for independence. They knew that over 90% would vote in favor of independence.

So no, it is not a recent thing. This is a conflict that has lasted for over 100 years. Kosovo should not have been part of Serbia to begin with. A decision by the great powers in 1913 led to everything that followed, but it is just for Kosovo to be independent after all this. So 2008 is the most recent big event, but it is the culmination of 100 years of resistance and attempts to separate from Serbia.",Kosovo,/r/europe/comments/f79g43/jamaica_rejects_thacis_claim_it_has_recognized/fijkkc1/,FWolf14,1582452345

And in last place, I think it's a cheap shot and fairly dishonest to equate the different schools of thought that fall under the umbrella of socialist thought to Nazism. The whole ideology of Nazism relies on racial superiority, eugenics and systemic extermination of races deemed as inferior in order to purify the world.

&gt; EU made it impossible for Germany to declare war on France. I will grant you that! 
For starters, it does not make it ""impossible"" for germany to declare war. If they wanna roll tanks in BE for the third time for good ol' times sake they can definitely if they accept the consequences. 
&gt; Thanks for not starting a war with your neighbours Germany. I'm glad you had an alternative outlet.

Waw since when do we have to defend economic/peaceful solutions? Since when is that not the ideal situation we all long for? You make it seems as if it's not a good thing or as if without it Germany would just start wars for the sake of it. You also make it seem as if EU is a way to keep Germany under control. How about we put general wellfare and the people before ego-tripping governments (unlike many countries in 2020) and managed to make people cooperate instead of shoot guns at each other.

To completely repudiate the historical experience of the Soviet Union, to repudiate the history of the CPSU, to repudiate Lenin, to repudiate Stalin was to wreck chaos in Soviet ideology and engage in historical nihilism. It caused Party organizations at all levels to have barely any function whatsoever. It robbed the Party of its leadership of the military.

&gt;Not if the server is yours. Which is possible with Matrix because it's a federated protocol.

Actually, Matrix leaks even more metadata:

1) they do none of the sealed sender stuff

2) anyone that messages you from their server, knows exactly where your server is because they need to connect to its IP address to send you the message in the first place

3) all of this is logged on all the matrix servers your messages pass through

&gt;Again, they ""promise"" that's the code they are running.

Part of the point of Signal is that the security of the cryptography does not matter on what the server is running.

And for some functions, like the [private contact discovery](https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/) stuff, the [open source] client itself performs remote attestation on the [open source] server software to verify that it is what is expected to be running.

&gt;But we are talking about state security here. You can't run your country security by believing

Well, the Signal folks have done a pretty good job of securing everyone's instant messaging for the past few years. And the EU embracing them for their external messaging is better than not using crypto at all.

Here are also some examples of other states using Signal as well: [India](https://theprint.in/india/telegram-signal-whatsapp-what-gandhis-kejriwal-badals-use-to-keep-their-calls-private/329578/), [Australia](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/25/the-weekly-beast-malcolm-turnbulls-got-a-new-app-hint-its-not-tinder), the [US](https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/333802-sen-staff-can-use-signal-for-encrypted-chat) itself, the [US military](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/01/23/deployed-82nd-airborne-unit-told-to-use-these-encrypted-messaging-apps-on-government-cellphones/) and a [British political party](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/17/tories-switch-to-messaging-app-signal-to-curb-whatsapp-leaks).

&gt; some US company they will do all they can to secure you.

They're actually a non-profit organisation and all their stuff is open source on GitHub. You can also read a bit about their history and efforts to go more mainstream in this recent article  [here](https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/).

&gt;If signal has their server code open, then why not take that code and run it ourselves?

You can totally do that, it does not support federation out of the box but nothing about the Signal protocol means that it can't be decentralised like that. But you'll find that most people prefer convenience over running software themselves.",,/r/europe/comments/f7a0dr/eu_commission_to_staff_switch_to_signal_messaging/fii3akl/,xbrotan,1582416915

5506,"&gt; Technically speaking, you'd need to oversize it several times over because renewables have a rather low capacity factor.

That doesn't matter. Nobody except grid operators gives a fuck about the nameplate capacity of a certain installation - total produced kWh per invested amount of money is all that matters.

&gt;Another factor is that 60% of energy is most during a power-to-gas-to-power, so some more capacity needs to be installed to compensate.

In the unoptimized process, yes. Up to 70-80% round-trip efficiencies have been demonstrated already, so that's probably feasible, and a 20% loss is very reasonable.

If we take the [latest numbers](https://www.lazard.com/media/451086/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-130-vf.pdf) of cost per kWh, and we take the *worst* of the wind fork, and the *best* of the new nuclear fork, then we see that even under those constraints it's *effectively possible* to put up *double* the amount of wind production for the same money. So we actually *can* overproduce enough to cover a 50% round trip efficiency and it won't even cost us a cent extra compared to nuclear, under this conservative estimate even.

&gt;The real, main problem though is that power to gas is not industrially viable at this point. Without a viable, scalable storage infrastructure, we'd have to rely on what's already there (like hydro, which is already close to capacity in most countries), this means there probably won't be enough storage around to compensate for intermittence.

But that's a big advantage of power-to-gas: we can make use of the existing storage and distribution networks of gas, and just expand them using already existing production lines and construction expertise. Power-to-fuel is also an option for liquid transport fuels.

&gt;What's the source on this? Is it more expensive than renewable + the required storage for a renewable-based grid?

This goes into detail: https://www.lazard.com/perspective/lcoe2019

As you can see, renewables + storage is already cheaper than nuclear without storage.

Do also keep in mind that nuclear power enjoys things like night tariffs that encourage consumers to adapt their consumption patterns to the production patterns of the nuclear power plants. The same can be applied to renewable production, with smart metering.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/f67sv5/two_weeks_of_wind_power_production_in_germany/fih9u5h/,silverionmox,1582408014

They do it out of empathy, which makes them the best people to actually make such a decision, apart from the obvious technical knowledge of the functioning of the human body that makes them the best suited to make a judgement on how the condition of the patient could possibly evolve.  
Sometimes the only option left to ease pain and suffering is by granting the relief of death, because we don't have yet the tools to alleviate them through other means.  
I think it's a natural extension of their role, but I understand that it brings the already massive burden they take by exposing themselves to all that pain and suffering to the ultimate degree, and it can create some enormous internal conflict with the assumption that death is the enemy that they defeat in their daily work, when instead it's those pain and suffering.

5834,"&gt; Bigger powers decided about that and Poland gained nothing, lost territory in fact, Poland was just shifted westwards and Germany lost some land colonized in the past. 

Colonized? Are you even serious? This land was part of Germany and the HRE and long before for thousands of years. 

If i remember correctly the Slav tribes first appeared around 800 in a piece of land much farther in the east. You took this region in the east after it was ravaged by Attila. And you never owned the piece of land you got after WW2 for a longer period. So how can we colonize a place we lived at for thousands of years. The PiS really fucked your brain, dude. Almost no reality left there.

&gt; Germany erased multiple countries from the map, expected to keep 100% of land, did torture population to near extinction and you complain about some lost land

The land you call ""some lost land"" was fully industrialized and pretty rich. It was not just some lonely desert. Again: it's worth trillions today and was one of the richest regions in Germany back then. And it's not our fault Russia - who also were among the nations that started the war btw - took away a junk of your country in the east. Blame Russia, not us. 

We paid more then enough, for decades. At some point this has to stop. And i think 75 years later it's about time. Nobody responsible for this war is alive anymore. 

&gt; you conquered during your Drang nach Osten earlier?

Show me a map when poland owned that land before Germany. And i show you a older one where it was owned by germany. Polish history lessons seem to be nothing but nationalistic gibberish these days. Seems like the PiS learned a lot from the Nazis about propaganda and indoctrination. 

&gt; Germans got to keep their country and freedom despite all death and destruction they caused, they were allowed to rejoin the West and thrive. It’s a marvel you should be grateful eternally.

Oh we are grateful. Grateful to the people who made that possible. Eternally. Which are for sure not polish radicals. Because if it would've turned out like those radicals back then wanted a lot more people would've been killed. More then a million civilians died already, when people with German roots were driven out of the east after the war was over. And without the help of the US the polish and czech mob would have killed even more. And why do you think another Versaille-like treaty would've ended any better? Most probably we would already mourn the victims of WW3.

&gt; After what your country did in the East fact that Germany didn’t suffer fate of Eastern Prussia is a marvel. Appreciate that and stop being arrogant obnoxious prat if you want to build any future between both nations.

As long as you cannot differentiate between modern day germany and nazi germany, there will be no such future.

5840,"&gt;That depends a lot on how large a geographical area they are spread onto. And meteorological phenomenon also vary on a macro scale, so you only smooth out local variations. Overall you'll still have variations in production on the same order of magnitude as what is shown in the OP. You'll never rely less on gas than nuclear does in that respect.

The gap is a lot smaller though than when you compare individual production units.

&gt;That just sounds like really bad scaling to me. Power-to-gas-to-power is an pretty wasteful process. Oversizing your production capacity several times over will inflate costs, along with the ecological and carbon footprints of renewables.

Why several times over? When it's established that we have power to gas, we just need to produce the required kWh in total, and the only additional capacity needed is to cover the storage losses. We'll still be able to use the same things we use for nuclear to balance the load, hydro, demand management, and the like.

If we build more renewable capacity, it will be because we use it to produce gas for industrial and heating use.

&gt;With that line of thinking, you might as well oversize your nuclear production capacity and use power-to-gas to do load following and produce fuel for non-electrical uses (like heating). That would save on cost by quite a margin.

Nuclear power is more expensive per kWh, even without accounting for the disaster insurance, which is taken on by the government.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/f67sv5/two_weeks_of_wind_power_production_in_germany/fifa5q8/,silverionmox,1582387568

&gt;It  doesn't matter. The West's entire edge is air and naval power. The  Russians' missile array poses a formidable threat to both of those  assets.

Good point.

&gt;The fear is very real. 

Fair enough, I live far enough away, but all the material in the world doesn't change the dangers from political interference, as you've mentioned. Armies and funding won't change that the same problems remain. Mitt Romney also said quite a few things about Trump, and the latter is to be re-elected in all probability, because his electorate wants to.

&gt; NATO, politically, is not at a stalemate 

NATO is based on civil societies, it won't function if the population loses all trust for it, as seen in the past few years and popular verbal attacks on officials. After all, the exercise of ""Defender Europe"" is I suspect because the questioning of Article 5, among other things. 

&gt; The overall goal right now concerning Russia is reassuring our NATO allies and deterring further Russian aggression 

Which explains why the first time Trump said he wouldn't honour Article 5 a brigade was quietly sent to Estonia from the EU.

&gt; Within 3 years, Al-Qaeda had conducted 4 complex, co-ordinated, and  lethal attacks in Africa, Asia, and North America, that had killed 3,500  Americans alone. More Americans died on 9/11 than on D-Day. Let that  sink in. The attacks were not stopping, Al-Qaeda had to be stopped. 

That's almost equal to the deaths from coalition forces.

Perhaps I don't remember, I was still a teenager during the Bush Era. However, your rebuttal on Afghanistan neglected to address what the Afghanistan papers revealed.

There's another topic to have about the effectiveness of the ""war against terror"", how much it actually reduced terrorist attacks, the links between the Taliban and Al Qaeda versus other countries, 

There is no strategic vision on what to do now, even if Afghanistan had a better cause of war than Iraq. Officials *lied* about how this war was going to the general public. For all of our ignorance, we don't appreciate being lied to.

&gt;First  of all, Afghanistan was an Article 5 mission. We all signed onto NATO  and one of our allies was attacked. It was our duty to go in the first  place.

Which is why countries should exit NATO if that's how it's going to be used. The US is all over the world, it's a liability. 

&gt;Well, for one: it was for the prevention of future terror attacks from being launched from Afghanistan. That threat hasn't gone away, and it likely won't anytime soon. You're going to be looking at a long-term deployment of around 5000 troops for several decades, protecting Kabul until Afghanistan gradually becomes a more stable country in the lawless rural areas. That process hasn't been slowed, despite what the media would tell you otherwise.

As if the generals are more truthful with how much they lied, as shown by the papers. 

Well, I can't make any policy changes about this nation-building mission anyway.

&gt;As for Cost Plus 50, well America is mad now. And can you blame them? While all of their allies have committed to spending 2% of GDP on defense, they instead fucked off the US to promote social services, while simultaneously depending on the US for defense. George W Bush politely asked for this to stop. Obama begged for it to stop. Now Trump is Trump so he is going to be very abrasive in making us, the allies that have been incredibly delinquent in our defense funding, pay our fair share. 

Oh? The US is mad. We wouldn't want, after all they can do what they want to who they want, but god forbid their torturing, murdering politicians don't get money for their mercenary force. Fuck them being mad, they can pay for all the soldiers, all the civilians they got killed in their wars.

""50%"" plus for their army, right? It's a protection racket. I'm in France, but that strategy milked the most pro-US countries for all that they're worth. It's to become a dependent like South Korea.

I'm in France, it goes from 1,9% to 2,4% of total GDP based on what's measured, so it's not about money. It's about how they can demand whatever they want, and we all have to dance to please them, and we can't stop them even if they want to do something.

&gt;It's simply wrong to not spend what we agreed while simultaneously criticizing the US for their massive defense budget.

I don't criticize the US for their massive defense budget, I criticize them for blaming us for it and managing to not be anymore trustworthy for it. I would prefer a US with a smaller budget, if I knew they wouldn't be risking a political shift every so often because of it, ranging from isolationism to pro-war at a moment, because it's always unilateral.

It's why operation ""Defender"" has (at least among my family) convinced no one. We all know the US has money, we just don't think it will mean anything. 

&gt;This is totally incorrect. Yes, Russia, Assad, and Iran have all been fighting ISIS. But their primary goal was always to support the Assad regime. What we mean when we say ""Caliphate"" is the physical territory-the quasi-state-that ISIS controlled through the monopoly on the use of force. ISIS literally had its own, pretty much functioning, country. This was not what Russia, Syria, and Iran were fighting.

It's obfuscating the fact those forces fought and retook territory from ISIS. Whatever their motives they were on the ground before us, one cannot take away their role in the defeat of ISIS.

&gt;That caliphate was not destroyed until the NATO air coalition started hammering it along with the Iraqi Army.

There were airstrikes since 2014 and was of aid according to allies on the ground, but it's as simple a historical fact as saying that ""the Japanese didn't capitulate until the Soviet Union declared war on them"". 

&gt;I don't know what else to tell you to convince you of it, that's just simple historical fact.

I truly don't know what there is to be convinced of. It's a historical legacy that it took a coalition from most of the world's powers to destroy the Caliphate. NATO screaming victory by itself sounds hollow, especially when it was done on the backs of Iraqi and Kurdish allies who took key cities such as Mosul and Raqqa.

&gt;I'm totally on board with blaming the ""West"" for that one. I am extremely critical of Obama's decision to prematurely leave Iraq, among his many other foreign policy disasters. I am a firm believer of when you see a decisive mission that could help global security, with a clear exit strategy, we should take it. Destruction of the caliphate was one such mission.

Obama, Bush, the French and British Empire, whichever the case.

about the dna part: i just referenced a dna study which states kurds and zazas are so similar that the claim of a seperate zaza identity is not supportable. about the facebook part: having reasonable admins does not mean facebook groups are unbiased, if you clear all opposing ideas, there wont be any opposing ideas there. in my surrounding, people who read and are reasonable enough don't use facebook. i can't trust an media which is controlled by government.. you can give me some articles if you want. i gave mine in upper post. and notice that my claim was not even based on dna study, still i did give you some. my claim is based on sociological analysis.",,/r/europe/comments/f7pfr8/star_in_european_languages/fieiixx/,paterseraph,1582379187

&gt;That was very shitty, I'm critical of that as well. I will say that the Kurds would have been abandoned eventually when Assad finished up with Idlib Province and turned his sights on his Eastern and Northern borders.

I know, I agree. I think that will haunt us, even if some predicted it as early as 2015.

I only wish they could have been proven wrong.

&gt;With all due respect, the public don't have a clue when it comes to defense or global security. I sympathize with the frustrations, but the average person doesn't know a damn thing about the consequences of withdrawal from the Middle East.

The public is tired, the public is very tired.
The public will one day get angry.

Well if isn't already. I think some are just resigned that there will be wars forever, as the ones who yell about toppling governments for it are just the fringe.

&gt;The flare-up with Iran has only marginally and temporarily impacted the anti-ISIS coalition which is still working very well.

Seems so after a few weeks. We were lucky.

&gt;It's very simple. Should Russia cause tensions in the world by, say, supporting a murderous regime in the Middle East, conquer their neighbours, or threaten NATO, the Bosporus is the only access they have to the ocean via their warm water ports. If NATO wanted to, in an extreme case, they could bar Russian access through the Bosporus, massively crippling their ability to project force.

I suppose you're right. All frustrations aside there's a reason Turkey is in the alliance.

&gt;We won't move into the conflict regions but we are very much involved in western Ukraine. I can almost guarantee as soon as the conflict is ended, Ukraine will fast become a NATO member. They currently have one of the closest relationships with NATO of all non-NATO partners. They will almost certainly not get their land back, but they will get a guarantee against future incursions.

Hopefully.

&gt;This is categorically false. Maintaining a presence in the Middle East and Asia has never been more important than now, but that's a separate discussion entirely.

Maybe, that's a geopolitical discussion for another day which would need to be presented more as an article. 

&gt;This is hyperbole. One, France has a volunteer army. Nobody has to join if they don't want to. Two, we've only ever had one NATO war where people were obligated to participate by Article 5. That was the War in Afghanistan following 9/11. That was an incredibly legitimate war to participate in. 

No, but that doesn't fellow citizens don't go to war for it. 
Afghanistan was the more legitimate of the war, or at least one can't complain because it did follow all of the agreements.

&gt;Three, the US does not really need NATO to keep its hegemony. US naval and air power is eons beyond the rest of the world combined. 

Good point, you're absolutely right. Most of NATO needs the US, but it's not the reverse, hence the current situation.
