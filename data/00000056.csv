1. Yugoslavia was artificially conjured up in posh parisian salons after WW1 and consisted of nations with a totally different historical and cultural background. Slovenes actually never had any contacts with other south slavs whatsoever prior to 1918.They actually starded getting contacts in the 60's and 70's with the arrival of economic migrants from other yugoslav republics. They couldn't and to an extent still can't tell the difference between a Serb, a Croat and a Bosnikak. It was all the same to them...peoples south of the river Kolpa (which is a historical border between Francia, HRE and Cisleithania and the rest)  who speak the same language which we can't understand unless we learn it in schools, in the army or on the croatian seaside. 
2. We speak a south slavic language with some similarities with west slavic languages and tons of german loan words.  We can't understand croatian/serbian unless we learn it intentionally. 
3. Oh honey, we don't share the same cultural backgrownd wih the rest of the Balkans because we were never part of the Ottoman Empire but an integral part of Austria for 1000 years, we don't speak the same language and were never part of the same state prior to 1918. Even in second Yugoslavia we were a seperate republic.

274,"&gt; Do you mean it was invented by Germans in 1941?

No, I mean it was invented by Russians. Starting with tsars in Russian Empire and continuing with bolsheviks all of them are occupants for Belarusians.

&gt; Do you realize that it happened after war was lost? Otherwise Poland would take entire Belarus.

First of all Belarus can decide for itself, we didn't give right to communists to decide our future. Considering that we were living in Confederation with Poland (GDL+Kindgdom of Poland=Rzeczpospolita) before that and were occupied by Russian Empire 3 times (1772, 1793 and 1795) maybe we wanted to continue living with Poland in the same State. We proclaimed independent country BNR in 1918. 

Also as history show us countries that avoided communism like Finland now developed much better than those that were occupied by red plague.

&gt; Also are you aware that the same communists returned that land 18 years later?

So sweet. ""returned that land"" = reoccupied it. Uniting the state is only good when it's independent state. Are you aware that after this return level of life of people who were forced to join USSR worsened? Here they are talking about it. USSR basically robbed them, took away land and property:

The former typically follows the 'damn foreigners taking our jobs' rhetoric, while the latter openly entertains the conspiracy theory of white replacement. 

Concerning the cabinet formation of '10, there was much more at play than immigration. VVD had won the most seats, with PvdA coming 2nd, PVV 3rd and CDA 4th. CDA, VVD and PVV in a cabinet together wasn't going to happen, so they proposed a minority government of VVD and CDA, with confidence and supply from PVV (meaning PVV would vote with the government on proposals of confidence/budget). A large portion of CDA was however strongly opposed to cooperation with PVV, because of their anti-islam rhetoric, the desire to pass legislation banning headscarves in public service and making social security harder to obtain for those in the process of becoming citizens (among others). This bogged down negotiations significantly, and when a cabinet was agreed upon the tensions were high; no one was really satisfied or agreed on anything. This all became painfully clear 2 years later, when PVV withdrew their support over a disagreement concerning austerity measures. New elections had to be called, wherein PVV weakened; 15.4% in 2010 compared to 10.1% in 2012, losing 9 seats in Parliament.

That's what I alluded to; PVV's unwillingness to seek compromise (which is kinda necessary for any party hoping to do well in a parliamentary system) saw them squandering long-coveted positions in government, and then causing that same government to fail, the aftermath of which turned out only worse for the party. On top of that they've gained a reputation of being unreliable partners, so they're isolated in Parliament.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/jvxxu5/dutch_prime_minister_rutte_mr_wilders_tells_me_to/gcokh3t/,Wampderdam98,1605668738

Curious. Because in Greece the Prespa Agreement was seen in a very bad light, and there were so many protests in Thessalonica and Athens, with millions of participants. It seems that the Greek populace saw that as treasonous and a defeat, while the politicians and the beaurocracy wanted to end this long lasting issue. I mean, is it not officially accepting them as ""Northern Macedonia"" basically allowing them to use the name, albeit not directly referring to Macedonia as a historic and topologic location? 

&gt;What goes around comes around - Turkey is having a field day with Greeks these days, Karma is a bitch.  

Interesting statement. How is that the case? I mean, heck, now Greece has been buying war weapons like crazy, many of them even being focused on the attack, because it wanted to ouballance those of Turkey. And see now, how Turkey has a great problem, as on one had she only has F-16s which have few pilots, because they have been purged by Ergodan's regime, and on the other Greece has been supplying the superior Dassault Rafales and F-35s. 

&gt;Macedonia is the real Macedonia, and always will be.

So they claim to be something that they aren't. A normal person would say: ""Well, they overestimate their appeal in the population.

""Antifa is sabotaging us!""

Rule of Law: European Commission launches infringement procedure to safeguard the independence of judges in Poland

Today, the European Commission launched an infringement procedure by sending a Letter of Formal Notice to Poland regarding the new law on the judiciary of 20 December 2019, which entered into force on 14 February 2020.

The new law on the judiciary undermines the judicial independence of Polish judges and is incompatible with the primacy of EU law. Moreover, the new law prevents Polish courts from directly applying certain provisions of EU law protecting judicial independence, and from putting references for preliminary rulings on such questions to the Court of Justice. After carrying out an analysis of the legislation concerned, the Commission concluded that several elements of the new law violate EU law:

First, the Commission notes that the new law broadens the notion of disciplinary offence and thereby increases the number of cases in which¬†the content of judicial decisions can be qualified as a disciplinary offence. As a result, the disciplinary regime can be used as a system of political control of the content of judicial decisions. The new law violates Article 19(1) of the Treaty on European Union read in connection with Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which establish a right to an effective remedy before an independent and impartial court. It is incompatible with the requirements of judicial independence as established by the EU Court of Justice.

Second, the Commission notes that the new law grants the new Chamber of Extraordinary Control and Public Affairs of the Supreme Court the sole competence to rule on issues regarding judicial independence. This¬†prevents Polish courts from fulfilling their obligation to apply EU law or request preliminary rulings¬†from the EU Court of Justice. The new law is incompatible with the principle of primacy of EU law, the functioning of the preliminary ruling mechanism as well as with requirements of judicial independence.

Third, the Commission notes that the law¬†prevents Polish courts from assessing, in the context of cases pending before them, the power to adjudicate cases by other judges.¬†This impairs the effective application of EU law and is incompatible with the principle of primacy of EU law, the functioning of the preliminary ruling mechanism and requirements of judicial independence.

Finally, the Commission notes that the new law introduces provisions¬†requiring judges to disclose specific information about their non-professional activities. This is incompatible with the right to respect for private life and the right to the protection of personal data as guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU and the General Data Protection Regulation.

Next step

The Polish Government has two months from this date to reply to the Letter of Formal Notice.

Background

The rule of law is one of the fundamental principles and values upon which the European Union is founded. It is enshrined as such in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. The Rule of Law is also essential for the functioning of the EU as a whole for example for the internal market and cooperation in the area of justice, freedom and security, which is based on mutual cooperation and recognition. It also ensures that national judges who are also 'EU judges' can fulfil their role in ensuring the application of EU law and can properly interact with the Court of Justice in the context of preliminary ruling procedures. The Commission, together with other institutions and the Member States, is responsible under the Treaties for guaranteeing the rule of law as a fundamental value of our Union and making sure that EU law, values and principles are respected.

Events in Poland led the Commission to open a dialogue with the Polish Government in¬†January 2016¬†under the Rule of Law Framework. The process is based on a continuous dialogue between the Commission and the Member State concerned. The Commission keeps the European Parliament and Council regularly informed.

Due to lack of progress through the Rule of Law Framework, on¬†20 December 2017, the Commission triggered the Article 7(1) procedure for the first time, by submitting a Reasoned Proposal for a Decision of the Council on the determination of a clear risk of a serious breach of the rule of law by Poland. There were already several debates and three hearings on the Rule of Law in Poland in the General Affairs Council.

On¬†29 July 2017, the Commission launched an infringement procedure on the Polish Law on Ordinary Courts, on the grounds of its retirement provisions and their impact on the independence of the judiciary. The Commission referred this case to the Court of Justice of the EU on¬†20 December 2017.¬†On 5 November 2019, the Court of Justice issued a final judgement in the case, confirming in full the position of the Commission.

In addition, on¬†2 July 2018, the Commission launched an infringement procedure on the Polish Law on the Supreme Court, on the grounds of its retirement provisions and their impact on the independence of the Supreme Court. On¬†24 September 2018, the Commission referred the case to the Court of Justice of the EU. ¬†On 17 December 2018, the Court of Justice issued a final order imposing interim measures to stop the implementation of the Polish law on the Supreme Court. On 24 June 2019, the Court of Justice issued a final judgement in the case, confirming in full the position of the Commission.

On¬†3 April 2019, the Commission launched an infringement procedure on the grounds that the disciplinary regime undermines the judicial independence of Polish judges and does not ensure the necessary guarantees to protect judges from political control, as required by the Court of Justice of the EU. On¬†10 October 2019, the Commission referred this case to the Court of Justice of the EU.¬†On 14 January 2020, the Commission decided to ask the Court of Justice to impose interim measures on Poland, ordering it to suspend the functioning of the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court. On 8 April 2020, the Court of Justice ruled that Poland must immediately suspend the application of the national provisions on the powers of the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court with regard to disciplinary cases concerning judges, confirming in full the position of the Commission. This order applies until the Court will have rendered its final judgment in the infringement procedure.

A new law of 20 December 2019 amending a series of legislative acts governing the functioning of the justice system in Poland, entered into force on 14 February 2020. Today, the Commission sent a Letter of Formal Notice to Poland regarding this new law on the judiciary.

Again, this is almost EU federalist fan fiction at this point, the EU isn't going to invade Poland (it can't, it wouldn't want to, it'd face massive issues if it did, The international response would be entirely on Poland's side, for what I hope are obvious reasons) but above all, it's not a thing, never mind the EU not having an Army, or any ability to act in that way..

every single indepedent entity states that eastern europe is lagging behind in rule of law and democracy.

wtf is there to like about your part of europe? all i see are whiny choosing beggars in the grips of a fervent and racist nationalist mentality.

which btw, if the west were to adopt in the 90's and early 2000's would never have seen your part of europe ever in the EU.

Finland has been part of Sweden for centuries, so for all intents and purposes it has been part of what we understand Scandinavia to be - for a long time. The idea that Finland is not part of Scandinavia is as recent as the Finnish independence. Estonia shares a similar story, being colonized by Germans and ruled by the Teutonic Order, Denmark, Sweden and Poland.

Despite both Finland and Estonia not having been imperial superpowers like Sweden or Denmark themselves, they definitively have been essential parts of them. This includes culture, trade, religion and politics.

You could argue that Estonia has a much more strong relationship to the Germanosphere and specifically German and Prussian culture, but since the russification and the expulsion of the Germans that is a thing of the past - whereas the scandinavian culture persists until today.

1249,"&gt;My point is that political considerations are impacted by historical and cultural precedents, in this case Croatia being admitted into Interreg CE.

And not admitted into Initiative MittelEuropa. Interreg is just an economic grouping in order to access EU funds, as I said, it has no other purpose other than that. Learn about EU funds. 

&gt;Considering it has nothing to do with Balkans prior to 1918, I fail to see how it can be ""transitional"". It was an integral part of CE right up until the end of WW1.

Considering it's a full Balkan country in the last century, I see no reason to dismiss it. The modern concept of nations based on ethnicity is born in the 19th century, so you deciding to get closer to Balkan nations rather than others is telling. 

&gt;Middle Ages? ""Central Europe"" emerged as a concept at the start of the 19th century and was appearing on maps by the 1840. And yeah, if we're going to split hairs, culturally speaking, only the Austrian-influenced northern half of Croatia should be considered Central Europe, with the Italian-influenced Mediterranean half being a better fit for Southern Europe.

You mentioned Catholic vs Orthodox, that's a thing that stopped being relevant for a long time now, that's why I brought up the Middle Ages. As for MittelEuropa, it was more of a catch-all term for territories under German rule/influence. I understand that you take pride in being ruled by Germans as opposed to your people actually choosing who they want to be close with, but this is not an opionion that everyoneshares. 

&gt;Kajkavian still exists, bro. So does Chakavian....albeit it barely.

So do other dialects of the South Slavic continuum. What's the point? That connects you even further to South Slavs aka Balkans and not Germans or West Slavs. 

&gt;Religious doctrine isn't the point here, cultural legacies are. Catholicism left a huge mark on historical architecture and design, for example, which greatly affects the visual character between regions.

Huh? Catholicism and architecture have not much to do with one another. A Bavarian town and a Spanish town will look completely different, despite both being in Catholic regions. If we go by architecture, then there's even less reasons to consider Romania Balkan, we've never had the typical Ottoman architecture here. 

&gt;And because it was not part of the original Balkans.

No such thing as ""original Balkans"" exist. It is not a geographic term, just a political one that evolved over time. Initially it refered to the Balkan mountains, then to the Ottoman territories in Europe, later on it was adopted by Yugoslavia. In the modern version of this term, Croatia is definitely Balkan, more precisely Western Balkan. 

&gt;Actually, the trend in modern geo-cultural academia is a return to traditional cultural paradigms, the UN published a working paper on just this a while back:

Yeah, it just so happens that a UN 3-page paper doesn't change much in the public perception of stuff. Apparently, neither it does to the UN itself since Central Europe is not even a thing according to them. This is the classification of Europe according to the UN: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Europe_subregion_map_UN_geoscheme.svg/1024px-Europe_subregion_map_UN_geoscheme.svg.png

1262,"&gt; Women can't be priest, and no one decided that except the men who made this rule, not god, not anyone else. Men made most if not all of the rules that the church  abides to. 

Are you aware that some of the most prominent figures in the early church were women? The doctrine the Catholic Church follows was commanded directly by God, if not through in the scriptures, then through the teachings of the apostles which were given authority to preach and lead the Church in His name. Let us also remember nobody has ever had the authority to change church doctrine in 2000 years, as only God can.

&gt; The position of the pope itself shouldn't exist, because according to your religion everyone is made equal and no one is closer or farther from god, and no one should be. Namely, the church and their immense hirearchy system. 

You are aware that the first Pope was appointed so by Christ directly right? And you do know what exactly the title of Pope means? Because we don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs any closer to God or God speaks to him or anything like that. Also the Church‚Äôs hierarchy exists as upon His resurrection, Christ commanded his Apostles to go out into the world and preach. The Priesthood today are their successors going back through a traceable unbroken line.

&gt; Which was made by men in times where some saw this and thought to exploit the weak minded and ascend to higher mortal powers. Unfortunately the position of pope and whatever is bellow him stayed throught the centuries, but it's just a remnant of past full of greed and selfishness.

Then why are the clergy bound by vows of celibacy, and in many cases personal poverty, when you argue they were only in it for money? The Priesthood is not an easy life. I won‚Äôt deny there have been clergy, and even some Popes who have abused their positions, but this was always pointed out, even in contemporary times. Contrary to your statements, the people were never stupid, and could see corruption in the church when it happened. The church was never institutionally or fully corrupt, in almost all cases it was limited to the perpetrators alone, with the exceptions of the indulgences scandal, because it was common knowledge these were never licit.

&gt; Women not being able to be priests is just a sign of ancient bigotry that belongs in the past where men and women could not think for themselves, but alas even with modern education it seems like most still can't.

Because this is a fallacy. People weren‚Äôt ignorant idiots 2000 years ago. It‚Äôs just that very little survives from so long ago and so we lose clarity on what their societies were like.

That's pretty much the same thing I'm saying. Except that something is not morally correct because we call it a ""human right"" and agree on it or not. It's morality is inherent.

&gt;What my initial point went against though was that by labeling those values ""morals"" one can put any arbitrary value in there and defend those as if they were non debatable.

A value is not equal to a moral, but values are usually connected to morals. But obviously someone needs to have a reasoning why something is morally correct or not, I don't think that there's anything that we consider to be right or wrong which shouldn't require some form of justification.

&gt;The abortion topic is an example. It is ethically a very complex dilemma with a large variety of different constellations.

Within the EU, close to three fifths (57.7%) of all graduates in 2018 were women. 10.9 % of all tertiary education graduates were men graduating from engineering, manufacturing or construction courses, compared with 4.3 % women, a difference of 6.7 percentage points. ICT studies was the only other broad field were more men than women graduated with a share of female graduates that reached 1% of the total of tertiary graduates. In contrast, 10.2 % of the tertiary graduates were female health and welfare students while 3.5 % were men, representing a gender difference of 6.7 percentage points in the opposite direction for this subject. Also for business, administration and law, more women than men graduated in 2018 with 14.4% against 10.2% of all tertiary graduates.

France (796 000) had the largest number of tertiary graduates in 2018, some way ahead of Germany (565 000), Poland (470 000) and Spain (461 000). The proportion of graduates in business, administration and law was below 20% in Sweden, Italy, Finland and Spain, while it was particularly high in France (34.3%), Cyprus (39.0%) and Luxembourg (42.5%). For engineering, manufacturing and construction studies, there were relatively low shares of graduates in this field in Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Ireland and Malta (the only Member States to record single-digit shares), whereas relatively high shares were recorded in Lithuania (19.4%), Portugal (19.6%), Austria (20.6%) and Germany (21.4%).

1517,"( My apologies to the anonymous Redditor I‚Äôm stealing this from ‚Äî as they wrote this idea down in a far more concise and intelligent way than I‚Äôm paraphrasing. )

I read a comment on here recently that essentially explains any conservative presidential candidate can expect 25-30mil votes simply on the basis of two single-issue voters in the US: the pro-gun and anti-abortion groups. They would rather see the country burn down before voting for a more liberal candidate, even if they are clearly more qualified. 

Then you have the ‚Äúreligious right‚Äù extreme types who have been brainwashed to think the party of ‚Äúfamily values‚Äù is still somehow that. They‚Äôd rather elect a cheating-with-porn-star, doesn‚Äôt even go to church, holds the Bible upside-down type just because the R next to his name. (Plus Biden‚Äôs a Catholic, or godless heathen in their view.)

Finally, you have the my-team-must-win-at-all-costs type; this is the Republican faction who doesn‚Äôt fit neatly into any of the above categories, but still has the same sort of mentality / unwillingness to even consider qualified non-GOP candidates. Because ‚Äúowning the libs,‚Äù I guess. Even if they are voting against their own interests (and quite frankly, unless they‚Äôre clearing $250k+/yr... they are).

That‚Äôs before you get into the smaller factions, like the folks who thought electing a reality tv star in 2016 would be a laugh, people who straight-up hated Hilary (on both sides), BernieBros having a hissy fit, etc. 

I don‚Äôt have a good idea of what the 2020 demographics looked like compared to 2016, but I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs proportionally much different (besides the higher voter turnout overall). There are probably a lot of folks who also subscribe to the ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt change horses mid-stream‚Äù logic, even as abysmal as the current ‚Äòhorse‚Äô has done. 

It‚Äôs not unfathomable that you could reasonably pick up 60-70mil votes with the groups above.

It was just too much. The first thing I did when coming home was falling onto the sofa and sleeping for a while because I was so goddamn tired all the time.

I then asked for a 4 day work week for a few years and finally got it like 2 years ago. And with that I instantly lost 11 of that 55 hours to a mere 44. And now in 2020 with homeoffice mostly I again gained 2,5h every day so my total working hours is now only 32.

Amongst those who identify as independents, a full 60% of them opted for the centrist label.

Among Democrats, 42% of respondents claimed to be on the left. Another 42% of Democrats identified as centrists.

2023,"&gt;I would suggest these NGOs stop their  activities. The coast guard we have return the boats to where they set  off from.   

There are three problems with this:
- But what happens to the people that have the right to get asylum? How do you make it possible for these persons to come to europe?
- Neither a NGO nor a civil rescue mission is allowed to bring these refugees back to where they come from. This is non-eu area and landing these people there is basically like a military intervention to a foreign country. This only works if there are bilateral deals which usually involve the EU paying money to e.G. Tunesia.
- The motivation for the NGOs was, that the coast guards stopped the rescue of migrants: The reason why Sea-Watch was founded was the end of the MareNostrum operation. Wikipedia states:

&gt;The operation ended on 31 October 2014[3] and was superseded by Frontex's Operation Triton, which operates a smaller search and rescue capability. Unlike Mare Nostrum, Operation Triton focused on border protection rather than search and rescue, and operates closer to the Italian coast.[5] The termination of Mare Nostrum has been criticized as a cause of the increased death rate among migrants to Europe in the Mediterranean, which increased tenfold between 2014 and 2015.

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mare_Nostrum)

&gt;And the politicians should get around to setting up proper  funding for refugees in need and a system where countries can take in  people voluntarily from refugee camps, and where citizens who want to  can sponsor such a family or even take them in if they have the  appropriate accommodations and means for it. That way the Germans who  want to can take in all the people they want themselves.

I basically agree with all of your points here (ignore the fact that it is not easy to take refugees if the government/other EU-governments don't support it for mostly political reasons)",,/r/europe/comments/junkif/germanys_seaeye_adds_fourth_migrant_rescue_ship/gcios8n/,jounathaen,1605550802

As an economic block, even with the level of political union currently in play, the EU can't effectively counter the US, China or even other regional power. However to step up and integrate to the point where it can make use of the size of the EU more generally it needs buy in from member state governments and citizens. 

That said, I don't think it is entirely reasonable to say that the world stage is dominated by the US and China either, they both have broad interests and are quite capable of advancing their interests in some parts of the world, they certainly have more capacity than the EU does in that sense, but their influence is still quite limited.

Their ancestors though called themselves Bulgarians and the first signs of the new Slavic Macedonian ethnicity emerged around 1840.

We don't want them to recognize all of this on official level, because it's a very hard pill to swallow and they are not ready to do it as a nation yet. I can put myself in their shoes. It's hard to change fundamental parts of how you perceive your ethnic identity and even more so when the changes are related to another ethnicity that you were conditioned to think of as ""enemies"". 

I agree that some Bulgarians are very intolerant on the issue with the direct ""you are Bulgarians and Tito created your fake country"", and although I can also see where they're coming from, that's not the right approach.

Yes but still you don't call Polish uncultured swine, but you call Turkish that pretty often in this sub. Spain banned divorcing after ww2 and abortions.

Italy is basically led by a neo-fascist no one tries to kick them out. Serbia did literal genocide on your backyard, Netherlands army even helped them, nobody tried to kick Netherlands out.

But I read here, every single day, kick Turkey from nato, they are not european, they do not share our values etc.

For example lowest levels are for parish under 1000 people. Parish priest pays at most 1559 zlotych (around 350 euros) every quarter of a year which is around 1000 euros/year. Vicars at these lowest populated parishes pays at most 503 zlote which is around 110 euros. It is paid every 3 months. The lowest tax in Poland in 2019 from church was 434 zlotych (around 100 euros) from some really small parish so around 300 euros in whole year.

2366,"Well European states are kind of failing...

Appart from that I think that most european cultures were stomped on for the sake of globalization, and by americanization, and that has created a big empty space in people's culture and identity. 

People want to feel like they belong to a group, a community in the cultural sense, rather than to a huge and bland free trade region. And since states are failing at recreating a feeling of patriotism, and we have to cohabit with strong communities who are slowly changing our way of life and questionning every aspect of our culture (be it some muslims who hate Christmas or extreme american leftism that refuses to understand, say, how the French perceive laicite or gender equality), people are turning to regionalism. 

Maybe it is easier to preserve a culture by retreating into a smaller community than by holding on to a failing nation.

There is also the economics aspect of it. I'm from northern France for example. We used to go down coal mines (both men and women) and most of the industries were here. 

Now with China taking over everything, we're left with unemployment, alcoholism, poverty and illiteracy. Meanwhile, Southern France gets to be the tourist hotspot, as it always was, and mediterranean culture is preferred over the more germanic cultures of North-eastern France. Add to that a bunch of Maghrebis and Africans inspired by the US racial theory claiming that ""they"" built our country, and you get an infuriating mix. 

I remember getting enraged when I heard a Moroccan man telling me ""we mediterraneans have culture, you northerners are the hard-workers"".

2619,"2/3 of American abortions are performed before 8 weeks gestation, and 51% (in 2017) of the women had been using contraception previously but it failed. In 2017 39% of abortions were performed by medication, not surgically. So, I fail to see a problem. Should a failed contraceptive mean that a woman is forced to carry a child (which in case you‚Äôve never done it, is super fucking hard on your body - my last one nearly killed me, literally) because someone decided it was against her rights to have an abortion? ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt have sex‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work when you‚Äôre in a relationship, using protection, and it fails.

Religion means ‚Äúthis is against my religion so I can‚Äôt do it‚Äù not ‚Äúthis is against my religion so YOU can‚Äôt do it‚Äù. 

Everyone cries late term abortion this and that, but that is rare and fucking heartbreaking. Abortions performed later are most likely of fetuses that were *wanted*.

2715,"&gt; The only way to actually solve the Transnistria problem is to give the region back to Ukraine 

I don't think the Transnistrians will consent to this, ever. In 2006 they held [a referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Transnistrian_independence_referendum), which showed overwhelming support for integration with Russia, and since 2017 the Russian tricolour (albeit in 1:2 proportion) is the s[econd official flag of Transnistria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Transnistria). Taking into account Ukraine's attitude towards Russia, I don't think that a Transnistrian-Ukrainian union is possible, unless there's an arrangement similar to an autonomous republic.

&gt; (same as they did with Crimea) 

Eh, nobody thought that Ukraine would ever want to secede, and Khrushchev, who was Ukrainian, gave Crimea to Ukraine in 1954, officially to ""celebrate the 300th anniversary of the [Pereyaslav Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pereyaslav_Council)"", and to ease infrastructural questions. 

The reason behind the fact that Transnistria is a part of Moldova isn't some malicious intent, it's quiet simple. From 1918 to 1940, Moldova proper was controlled by Romania, with the de-facto border running across the Dniester river. However, Moldovans also lived east of this river, which is why the Moldovan Autonomous S.S.R. was a thing, as a part of Ukraine. When Moldova was under Soviet control, the Moldovan S.S.R. and the Moldovan A.S.S.R. were merged. 

&gt;patch of land full of russian soldiers 

That are there as peacekeepers with permission from the Moldovan government. Afaik, 2160 soldiers are allowed, and only half of that number are stationed there.

2763,"Since clearly nobody in this comment thread has been a teacher before: death threats from students, at least in some schools, are exceptionally common. I taught in an inner city school for a full year, and received death threats weekly at a minimum. Know how many times those threats were ever genuine? Zero. I was never physically harmed by a student, nor did a student ever genuinely attempt to harm me. Note that this was a high school, so the kids I taught were several years older than this kid in question.

The fact that many people are calling for this kid and his family to be deported is downright psychotic. Even with the article giving us some info, we don't know what was going through this kid's mind at the time of the incident. We don't have a thorough idea of his home life, of his relationships with other students, teachers, etc. Hell, it might not even be a deeper issue, he's fucking 11 years old. Maybe he was just tired, or antsy, or bored. 

Yes, I know that Paty's murder was a horrendous act of terrorism. I do not dispute that. But that was an act committed by an adult. I find it extremely unlikely that an 11 year old kid, barring EXTREMELY exceptional circumstances, would have the fortitude of will and maddening ideological drive necessary to commit an act of Islamist terrorism via beheading their teacher.

‚ÄúPhotograph of nine European sovereigns standing or sitting, facing three-quarters right, wearing full State Dress. Taken at Windsor Castle during the funeral of King Edward VII. Standing (left to right): King Haakon VII of Norway, King Ferdinand of Bulgaria, King Manuel of Portugal, Emperor William II of Germany, King George I of the Hellenes, King Albert of the Belgians. Seated (left to right): King Alfonso XIII of Spain, King George V, King Frederick VIII of Denmark. King George V was related by ties of blood or of marriage to most of the sovereigns of Europe, some of whom gathered at Windsor for his father's funeral in 1910. Here he can be seen with two uncles (the Kings of Denmark and of the Hellenes), a brother-in-law who was also a first cousin (the King of Norway), another first cousin (the German Emperor), a first cousin by marriage (the King of Spain) and three distant cousins, all descended, as he was, from branches of the Saxe-Coburg family (the Kings of Bulgaria, Portugal and the Belgians).‚Äù

2831,"&gt;Someone who screams at a police officer who has literally nothing to do with lawmaking and only stands his/her guard passively is not just an idiot but an utter disgrace.

Police are an extension of the law. You don't see any politicians and lawmakers in riot gear lobbing tear gas grenades do you? If there were then I'm sure people would focus their attention on them.

&gt;She isnt standing up for anything or changing the situation,

She is in fact standing up for her reproductive rights by turning out with many of her fellow citizens and protesting. Protestests, especially ongoing protests &amp; strikes will sometimes lead to changes in governance and/or laws.

&gt;That is not how protests work.

Getting out and protesting against draconian laws...even if it heaps shouting a slogan at a cop, the public extension of the law, is exactly how protests work.

&gt;A police officers job is not to be screamed at but to protect citizens and deescalate the sitiation. 

Yeah in an ideal world maybe, but as we've seen over recent months they are more interests in protecting businesses, corporate profits and property. They keep just enough of the peace that their job doesn't become too hard. Police almost always escalate first in protests.

&gt;And before you start accusing the police of anything, you have no idea who this particular women is and how she does her job. The only thing this picture shows is that she is being screamed at and endures it calmly.

I'm not accusing the cop of doing or being anything other than a cop, who's job description may from time to time include being yelled at by protestors as they are, again, the physical representation/extension of the law in a public setting. I'd hope she's calm, angry or upset cops tend to shoot unarmed civilians when they panic.

&gt;By your logic it is okay to insult and harass cashiers and service personal as well because ""they are being payed to be there"".

Are cashiers making laws that control women's reproductive right? No? Then what the actual fuck is this supposed to mean?

&gt;This officer could very well have the same political views as the protestors but still goes to work to feed her family and do her job. A job that, if done correctly, is one of the most important jobs you can have.

I agree. But that doesn't mean they need someone sticking up for their feelings on the internet because they had a hard day. They're adults, they can manage just like the rest of us if they have a difficult job.

&gt;This is the last comment I will write and I have no intention of reading your answer. I will mute my inbox because your line of argument is not only completely illogical but also just straight up disgusting. Have a day.

Let's look at your side of this. Why would you push for laws that don't reflect the actions of citizens? Why would you push for laws that allow the state to punish people for making decisions? It sounds like your state is ""pro-choice"" in practice and ""pro-life"" in the letter of the law. That's asinine. If people have the freedom of choice, laws should reflect that freedom. In the U.S., the people pushing anti-abortion policies want to punish women for having abortions or prevent women from having them. Why would we want that law? It produced terrible results last time. People, as they apparently do in Brazil, had abortions anyway. They were unsafe and unsanitary. This cost a lot of lives and caused a great deal of suffering. Now, in the U.S., because of that terrible period, we have laws that say abortion is allowed. This is not an endorsement of abortion, but a guarantee that people cannot be targeted by the state for exercising their freedom. 

So again: Why should people accept laws that unjustly govern their bodies? You're saying they should accept these laws because, in your country, these laws are not enforced? Again, that's asinine. If your laws aren't insane, the people don't have to break the law.

It doesn't work that way, because laws don't decide moral truths, moral truths ideally are what influence the law.

2881,"This is the thing with those conflicts, it was never ""superpower vs. Minor nation"" it's more like ""Superpower vs superpower using population of minor nation as military force""... 

Obviously such large conflicts are complex to untangle and analyze. For example, a not insignigicant factor here, which is often overlooked, was Kruschevs de-Stalinization. 
The de-Stalinization alienated the Chinese who felt the Soviets were betraying the ideology and Kruschevs admiration of the west even further allienated these two countries, that on paper, should be natural allies, this in turn made the Chinese support the Mujahideen by training and arming them at first in pakistan, and then just shamelesly in China itself, had Kruschev not done this, China could well have been supporting them and changing the outcome.

the British armed, funded and trained the Mujahideen as well, and so did the U.S, so did west Germany, so did Saudi Arabia, so did Pakistan and Egypt... along with providing logistics support and inteligence services. 3 major military powers and several smaller ones at the time were heavily supporting the rebbels in Afghanistan, while the Soviets were loosing support by their own citizenry and slowly going downhill economically due to the expenses of this war.

With Vietnam, it was an eerily similar story, but in this case, China was along with the Soviets supporting the Viet(at first at least).. The Soviets were the ones providing the weaponry responsible for the staggering ammount of U.S aircraft/helicopters that were shot down, and similarly, the people at home in the U.S grew weary of the war and demanded it's end.

In both cases though, this was not quite conventional war, In Afghanistan even more so because it included terrorism, but in both cases nonetheless, there was no clear distinction between combatant and civilian. Guerilla war is what gets these large armies to their knees.

When you think about it, these little struggles and proxy wars in smaller nations were perfect for kicking in teeth of major military powers... what good is all that arsenal if you have no idea who to fire it at... all those nuclear weapons are no good either.

This is maybe witnessed by the widespread use of Egypt (for what its citizens call al-Misr), India (Bharat) and Albania (Shqip√´ri), in addition to Greece and China mentioned above. Whatever the reasons for these names, it's fairly difficult to see how they would change in people's speech to those transliterations (or indeed anything else). Maybe if the official names would be used in schoolbooks and other such materials, within a generation or two they would stick? It seems like a huge effort, but maybe I'm just too pessimistic.

There are also some corner cases that have the potential for political or practical difficulties. Which one of the three fairly similar names of Belgium should be used?

Not as good as N95 or better - but far better than I expected.

I shared your sentiment prior to reading these studies. Visors being effective is a very good thing, as it's very hard to make excuses for not wearing a visor.

This is a case of green grass. I‚Äôm from New Zealand and lived in Australia for a number of years. I have lots of family there. Now I‚Äôm living in Denmark and have friends from the UK. Australia is far closer to America‚Äôs work culture than the UK. It has *far* longer hours, far worse work-life balance, and far weaker employer rights and protections and benefits. I don‚Äôt agree it‚Äôs a better place to raise a family. Housing costs are astronomical compared to anywhere outside major UK cities, and public transport doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to the UK. But yes, doctors are paid more, and the weather is better, and on balance, that‚Äôs enough for many people. It should be noted that Australia has exactly the same issues as the NHS: reliance on foreign doctors because they don‚Äôt pay enough relative to the high cost of living, and, crucially, *they don‚Äôt train enough, just like every developed nation.* It‚Äôs almost impossible to get into medical school in Australia/NZ.

3174,"That website is satire, right? It's hard to tell with ""science"" bloggers these days.

With regular cloth masks and surgical masks as people wear them there is no measurable effect if you compare all the actual studies that were done in an empiric manner with a control group. The only studies that found that those do anything at all are ones where they didn't test them in real life situations but fixed them to a breathing machine and counted the virus parts that made it through (big surprise, the mask reduced them). However, when one checks if more people get infected if they don't wear cloth/disposable masks vs mask wearers there isn't a single study that finds a significant difference. This has been studied in multiple locations around the world and the results are all the same - no statistically meaningful difference. Some papers do speculate they might help and suggest more research is needed, but that's all. 

Let's not forget these mask aren't worn by doctors to protect patients from getting the flu, they're worn during operations so that large spit droplets don't enter the wound and cause problems. They were never intended to protect against RNA virus infections. We have masks that do help with this, they have filters in them and have to form a seal over mouth and nose which the masks everyone wears in the streets don't do. And even then it's only some protection, not 100%.

However, I'm sure that if we were talking face to face we would have all sorts of unfamiliar accents; it would still bring our communication to a level much closer than any alternative involving only our native languages, even if not as perfectly as our writing.

Similarly, everyone writing the exact same word for a place is a tremendous step forward. As for the spoken part, requiring a bit of language proficiency for pronouncing a place's name is already required, as I said, for the places with no exonyms. I don't think it's a huge deal, regionally it might create ""quasi-exonyms"" because a group of people who is only reading the name might pronounce it wrong, but eventually as they come across natives and their own pronunciation we can learn the right way, and spread it around. Learning about different languages and cultures is great.

I think these benefits outweigh the comfort of having exonyms that are more adapted do a single language but detached from the original place's language or even all other languages. The fact that there is no rule for exonyms and no logic, only sporadic tradition, makes them very annoying in my opinion on a global scale.",Italia,/r/europe/comments/jumcoh/name_for_germany_in_european_languages/gcetuc4/,MrAlagos,1605464988

Covid has been in Italy since September 2019, according to a study by the Milan Cancer Institute
Antibodies found in a lung cancer screening group

---

The SarsCov2 virus was circulating in Italy as early as September 2019, therefore well before what has been thought so far. The confirmation comes from a study by the Cancer Institute of Milan and the University of Siena, which has as its first signatory the scientific director Giovanni Apolone, published in the Tumori Journal.

Analyzing samples of 959 people, all asymptomatic, who had participated in lung cancer screenings between September 2019 and March 2020, 11.6% (111 out of 959) of these people had antibodies to the coronavirus, of which the 14% already in September, 30% in the second week of February 2020, and the largest number (53.2%) in Lombardy.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/julyts/covid_has_been_in_italy_since_september_2019/gcefryt/,Dara17,1605457319

It was pretty far from everywhere, there was just a camping place (needed to charge my e reader, otherwise I‚Äôd have camped in the wild) and this restaurant.

As I said in another comment: I was traveling by bicycle, so needed &gt;4000kcal per day (basically food for two). A few factors which probably contributed to my high costs in Norway: I was traveling from the very north, so didn‚Äôt have much choice regarding shops (and maybe they are also more expensive up north). I wasn‚Äôt familiar with the currency and products, so didn‚Äôt know how to shop on a budget (for example here in Austria different (but comparable) kinds of bread or pasta can easily differ by 300% in price, I didn‚Äôt know that in Norway). I was traveling by bicycle with a camping stove. So I couldn‚Äôt do stuff like buy 5kg of flour and bake my own bread. I had to pay exchange fees at the ATM, it‚Äôs been some years, I think the ~1000‚Ç¨ was after exchange fees (i.e. I just looked at my bank account after I came back). I think I also bought some apple juice or ice tea.

In central and southern/eastern Europe spending during traveling was never an issue at all. In London, Brussels and Switzerland I regularly went to restaurants and was surprised that it wasn‚Äôt as expensive as I‚Äôd thought (everything except beer of course).

I had the money, it didn‚Äôt bankrupt me. It just surprised and annoyed me. I also had to buy some spoke nipples for my bicycle and they charged me like 20‚Ç¨ for 10 of them (you can get 100 for 10‚Ç¨ here, I actually somewhat expected them to give them to me for free and not bother typing those few cents (or so I thought) into the cash register).",,/r/europe/comments/juh118/3_am_drive_in_the_lofoten_islands_norway/gceg8th/,ImprovedPersonality,1605457583

Europe plans for a new long term legislation about digital services in the Common Market: the Digital Services Act (DSA). That of course isn't that good for Google, that being a nearly monopolistic actor of digital services on multiple markets, may have a lot to lose.

Well, Le Point newspaper revealed an internal memo about lobbying for high-ranked execs of Google, called ""DSA 60-Day Plan Update"". This memo describes a strategy to weaken the legislation. The problem isn't that Google is lobbying against the text, it's the methods proposed. Basically, asking the US administration to intervene, and using unorthodox methods to create internal discord through moles in Brussels administration.

No he just uses Polish left/right - in such political view your parties for sure are left leaning - adoption for homosexuals, homosexual marriage, pro-abortion and pro-imigration stance - only big polish party that comes close to that is ""the Left"" which is coalition-party led by SLD which was founded by former members of PZPR (comunnists).

What you are calling right is more like center-left to left (with some things closer to far-left) from Polish point of view. By the way current polish government is only right-wing - far-right is used only to national radicalism.

**If the EU is concerned that countries such as Hungary and Poland are not respecting EU values, it has a legal mechanism it could trigger. Find out about Article 7 of the Treaty of the EU.**

Rule of law is a key principle in democratic states. [Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012M002) mentions respect for the rule of law as one of the values the EU is founded on. A breach of EU values justifies a reaction at EU level and this is what the procedure under [Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012M007) aims to achieve.  


**Hungary**  


On 12 September, [MEPs decided to ask the Council](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20180906IPR12104/rule-of-law-in-hungary-parliament-calls-on-the-eu-to-act) to determine whether Hungary is at risk of breaching the EU¬¥s founding values. The procedure is in accordance with Article 7 of the Treaty on the European Union. MEPs raise a number of concerns about the functioning of the country‚Äôs institutions, including problems with the electoral system, independence of the judiciary and the respect for citizens‚Äô rights and freedoms.  


**The Article 7 procedure**  


The [Article 7 procedure](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2016/573922/EPRS_BRI%282016%29573922_EN.pdf) for protecting EU values was introduced by the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997. It includes two mechanisms: preventive measures, if there is a clear risk of a breach of EU values; and sanctions, if such a breach has already occurred. Possible sanctions against the EU country concerned are not clearly defined in the EU treaties, but might include suspending voting rights in the Council and the European Council.  


For both mechanisms, the final decision needs to be taken by representatives of member states in the Council, but the thresholds to reach a decision are different. For the preventive mechanism, a decision in the Council requires a majority of four fifths of member states, whereas a determination on the existence of a breach requires unanimity among EU heads of state and government. The EU country concerned does not take part in either vote. Check out our infographic for all the details.  


**Parliament's role**  


Under Article 7, Parliament is one of the institutions that can initiate the preventive mechanism by calling on the Council to determine that there is a risk of a breach of EU values. The plenary vote on Hungary was the first time that Parliament took the initiative of recommending that the mechanism should be triggered.  


To be adopted, the proposal needs to receive the support of an absolute majority of MEPs, namely 376, and two thirds of the MEPs who take part in the vote.  


[MEPs supported in March](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/bg/press-room/20180226IPR98615/rule-of-law-in-poland-parliament-supports-eu-action) a similar Commission proposal that sought to activate the preventive mechanism in the case of Poland. In that case, Parliament backed the concerns of the Commission about the separation of powers, the independence of the judiciary and fundamental rights in the country.  


MEPs urged EU governments to swiftly determine whether Poland was at risk of a serious breach of EU values and if so, to propose solutions. The Council held a hearing on the matter in June with Poland‚Äôs representatives explaining their position.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/juisw7/poland_threatens_to_veto_eu_recovery_fund_over/gcdffhs/,Hematophagian,1605435559

3637,"&gt; Montevideo Convention on Rights and Duties of States 1933

Ugh, the mindless missuse.

&gt; If Scotland is a nation state, why can't it leave the United Kingdom under international law, without hter UK deciding?

International law doesnt govern such things, or a lot to be honest, and the UK decided that Scotland doesnt have that right. While the EU has decided that states do have that right and established that in treaties.

You are trying to argue from authority, already a fallacy, without any authority mate.

&gt; The reason is they gave up their rights either by force hundreds of years ago, by shifting borders or by, in Scotland's case, the act of the union.

""They"" did no such thing, it was never decided by plebicite and the parliament at the time was not a modern representiative government. And the Acts of Union never stated anything about needing to ask the UK government for permission to leave, let alone hold a referendum to leave, hense why the Edinburgh Agreement was needed between Cameron and Salmon.

&gt; The UK is the nation state, Scotland is a nation.

3725,"1. WRONG

We have all nationalist organizations banned, Russian marches are also banned, which Navalny complained about when he did not hide his nationalist views and hatred of Jews

2. WRONG

Is Assad's support bad? why? it was necessary as NATO did in Libya and where are the slave markets now instead of a prosperous country? What's wrong with Kadyrov? he is the head of the Chechen Republic, and what's wrong with that? in Crimea, it is better not to say your views for sure, the people there are especially patriotic

3. WRONG

All the sanctions and hostility came precisely from the West and Ukraine, we always answered. if you are old enough and remember the Maidan shouted there that it is necessary to kill the Russians, remove the Black Sea fleet from the Crimea, etc. our sanctions are every time a response to the sanctions of other states, we have never imposed sanctions first.

4. WRONG

and still it is less than spending, for example, Saudi Arabia, and if you have seen a map of the world, then we have borders with the world's nuclear powers and NATO.

Victory Day is necessary so that people remember how terrible the war was, and that you always need to remember that it can happen again.

In Crimea, there was an uprising of the people, they proclaimed independence. Russia recognized independence and it was the right decision, because Russian language is gradually banned in Ukraine, yet another ban will come into force on November 17.

How did Armenia end up here? Azerbaijanis and Armenians do not even mention Russia in this conflict, but since you hate Russia for no reason, it does not even matter to you, you did not even take an interest in the question.

Georgia? Are you serious? even an international report is about the fact that the war began because of Georgia:

4099,"Now you're just pulling things out of your ass. The ""plans"" of Napoleon here seem more like the aspirations of the German General Staff in World War I. Furthermore, my trusty friend Wikipedia begs to differ, though if you want, I can get you more... analytical and pointed resources.

&amp;#x200B;

""Napoleon hoped to compel the Emperor of All Russia, Alexander I, to cease trading with British merchants through proxies in an effort to pressure the United Kingdom to sue for peace.\[19\] The official political aim of the campaign was to liberate Poland from the threat of Russia. Napoleon named the campaign the Second Polish War to gain favor with the Poles and to provide a political pretext for his actions.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, 1. Solidify Continental System, 2. Liberate Poland

&amp;#x200B;

Poland was at that time still a quite recent, if mostly dead state. It was NOT Russia, and at that point, it had ample pretext for being a sovereign state back then with the Duchy of Warsaw.

The balance of power is a practiced way of ordering the world, and it was made in Europe. This is what made it ideologically impossible to go out and conquer other nations. If any rulers became too ambitious he would quickly be turned upon by coalitions of enemies. This is because trying to conquer another country would bring the whole system out of balance. States were supposed to be sovereign in their own lands, so no other state had the right to conquer wholly. This believe in nation states and their sovereignty kept wars limited. Because no war could ever have the goal of destroying another nation. 


This obviously was not the case in Africa, and in large parts of Asia. Because there was no such thing as a nation-state there. And without this basic unit of the international order, there could not be any laws that applied there. For Europe Africa was the equivalent of an anarchy, a place where only force ruled. 


That is why conquest happened outside of Europe. Inside it was mostly illegitimate, and any ruler who engaged in it was put down. Outside though, it was legitimate. And more, since every nation was competing with others it wasn't only legitimate to conquer it was necessary as well.

I'm not going to STFU, bro. My keyboard is clattering right now.

&gt; This happens everywhere. There is gang fighting using knives but violent crime especially death and wounding is so much higher in USA than London, and even THAT is the capital and one of the most populated cities in the world.

And what evidence do you have that this gap is caused due to a lack of gun control?

Looking at UK statistics, knife crime in Surrey has increased by 559% between 2010/11 and 2019/20. What do you think caused this, since apparently you think you are the one who can solve violent crime, what happened in Surrey bro?

&gt; Disregarding your attempt to label me authoritarian, you hold on to your gun ""rights"" like anything ultra-destructive humanity has made is thereby a human right to wield.

Do you think humanity will ever lose the knowledge of firearms technology? Is that a realistic goal?

&gt; Firearms are an incredibly dangerous tool that should not be in the hands of ANYONE 

What about the police and the army?

&gt; because society has markedly less murder in all countries that don't have them including Australia who HAD firearms and removed them in the same way that USA will if there is any hope for the future.

That is not how data collection works. For every Australia, I can give you [a Czech Republic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Vra%C5%BEdy.png). It turns out that gun laws aren't the only things that have changed since the 90s.

&gt; I'm glad you mentioned ""treating symptoms instead of the disease"" because the disease here is the insatiable desire for firearms because of their arms-race ability to make the individual feel like the most powerful as long as they have *it*, and the latest of it.

https://gaslab.com/blogs/articles/oxygen-enrichment-ventilators-fire-risk

&gt; Hospital Oxygen Ventilators Increase Fire Risk
&gt;
&gt; The rapid increase in ventilators used in hospitals due to the COVID-19 outbreak has increased the risk of fires due to oxygen enrichment in enclosed areas.
&gt;
&gt;Ventilators are used to both provide mechanical breathing assistance and supplemental oxygen to patients who have difficulty breathing is a common occurrence in late-stage COVID-19 patients. The oxygen used with a ventilator may be supplied by stand-alone pressurized tanks or by connection to a hospital-wide bulk oxygen source. In either case, the oxygen ventilator, tubing, and connections to the ventilator have the potential to leak oxygen into the room resulting in oxygen enriched air.
&gt;
&gt;Because oxygen is required for fire, increased oxygen levels in an enclosed room means fire can start more quickly, spread faster and burn hotter than in rooms filled with fresh air.

4285,"&gt; The only country that does so.

That is literally my point. Turkey decided to go *against* the international thing and commit to it. Unlike Armenia, literally says so in the very next text after your quote.

Good job at stating the obvious, captain!

&gt;NK had piece until Turkey greenlighted Ajerbaijan to attack it.

Shows how little information you have. NK attacked surrounding Azerbaijani lands and Azerbaijan attack NK in individual cases all the time in the last decades, there was never a lasting peace. Did you learn about this conflict like just this month?

&gt;TCs don't accept modern principles of functional democracy. They want veto rights and such. Noone ever denied political power in TCs

Blabla, you are clearly not aware when it was even in the treaty to ensure the rights of Turks that made Cyprus...exist in the first place as a state, Greek leadership tried to make multiple policies that restrict Turks rights in the state already. This is before any military was involved mind you.

So again, did you learn about that conflict just this month as well? Without equal rights, we've seen what Greeks do already. 

&gt;That's why TMT had smuggled 10000 weapons. Because they wanted peace.

TMT was formed against EOKA. What are you even on about? Lmao.

Tiny self sufficient types growing crops for themselves and earning tiny sums when they have a glut of crops or commercial growers who grow specific cash crops on a much larger scale.

4375,"&gt; The Soviets stopped building like that after Khrushchev came to power, as he found it too ornamental, and unsuitable for a Communist state.

I'm a little suspicious that it has something to do with broader contemporaneous trends in architecture.

[Khrushchev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev) entered office in 1953.

Nobody is going to accuse [Ayn Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand) of being a communist, but *The Fountainhead* (1943) waxes on about modernist, functional architecture -- out with the Baroque and all that.

It looks like there was a resurgence in Baroque, [Baroque Revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_Revival_architecture), that ran until the end of the 1800s:

&gt;The Baroque Revival, also known as Neo-Baroque (or Second Empire architecture in France and Wilhelminism in Germany), was an architectural style of the late 19th century.[1] The term is used to describe architecture and architectural sculptures which display important aspects of Baroque style, but are not of the original Baroque period. Elements of the Baroque architectural tradition were an essential part of the curriculum of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, the pre-eminent school of architecture in the second half of the 19th century, and are integral to the Beaux-Arts architecture it engendered both in France and abroad. An ebullient sense of European imperialism encouraged an official architecture to reflect it in Britain and France, and in Germany and Italy the Baroque Revival expressed pride in the new power of the unified state.

Then it looks like from that point early in the 20th century, there was a shift heading towards more-functional and machine-like-looking styles.  I'm guessing that it had something to do with the shift from handmade, organic goods making up much of daily life to machine-made goods and synthetic stuff forming an increasing part of the modern world.

Ukraine is a democracy. It deserves to be an independent sovereign state, just like Belarus is currently trying to do. Russia broke international law and the Budapest Memorandum. A shame upon our great country. We've got so much land already - why do we need more when we can use our economy and culture to make ties with our neighbors, so we Slavs can finally learn to live in eternal peace. Furthermore, if Russia truly wanted peace and safety for all Russian speakers across the world, why didn't we pursue a policy of making agreements on autonomy and rights for Russian majority areas to establish peace in regions?

Moldova is a shitshow. Blame can be held on many sides, but Russia here is not absolved of it in the slightest. Holding soldiers there is just another way that we make barriers in Europe instead of uniting as one.

Georgia - Saakashvili may have declared war, but Russia was the one that provoked it.  We sent troops into that tunnel, and we had troops ready for our offensive into the region.

&gt; In 2019, a court convicted two men for ‚Äòcontempt‚Äô after they burnt an effigy depicting President Macron during a peaceful protest.

I don't know which case specifically the author is talking about, there was a movement last year where an ecology group peacefully removed Macron's portraits. Some of them were condemned of theft not contempt.

&gt; Parliament is currently discussing a new law that criminalizes the use of images of law enforcement officials on social media.

Again, playing with the truth. I'm not defending that law, we don't know what will become of it but the aim seems to be to hide the faces of policemen to avoid harrasment. I don't think it will prevent posting police brutality content online.

&gt; Being opposed to the cartoons does not make one a ‚Äòseparatist‚Äô, a bigot or an ‚Äòislamist‚Äô.

&gt; While the right to express opinion or views that may be perceived as offending religious beliefs is strenuously defended, Muslims‚Äô freedoms of expression and religion usually receive scant attention in France under the disguise of Republican universalism.

Because many muslims are either apathic or are not fully condemning terrorists. There's always a but..That person should not have done this or that.

&gt; In the name of secularism, or la√Øcit√©, Muslims in France cannot wear religious symbols or dress in schools or in public sector jobs.

Well, yeah.

&gt; France‚Äôs record on freedom of expression in other areas is just as bleak. Thousands of people are convicted every year for ‚Äúcontempt of public officials‚Äù, a vaguely defined criminal offence that law enforcement and judicial authorities have applied in massive numbers to silence peaceful dissent.

4508,"&gt;Male circumcision is not considered mutilation.

It is the very definition of it.  

""Mutilation is cutting off or causing injury to a body part of a person so that the part of the body is permanently damaged, detached or disfigured.""  

&gt;What is done to girls is actually mutilation and it is done with the precise intention to take away from them the pleasure that sex gives. It is a criminal thing because it gives nothing and takes something very important.

No, you are wrong.  
There are different grades of female circumcision, with the easiest one being as harmless as male circumcision.  
After all lot's of women do it as beauty surgery when they are not happy with the looks of their labia.

Here it is described in detail how male and female circumcision do not differ:

https://blogs.bmj.com/medical-ethics/2017/08/15/does-female-genital-mutilation-have-health-benefits-the-problem-with-medicalizing-morality/

&gt;But parents have the right to decide on their sons health. 

No, circumcision is not about health.    
In Europe or the USA, the health benefits are negligible to non existent.  
And if you want to make it about health, cutting away something from your penis can create problems as well.  

Circumcision is all about social norms.  

&gt;This is exactly the position of the CDC and I agree.

As an American organisation, the CDC has a stake in this whole thing and my link makes it obvious how they bend their arguments.  
Every state in Europe advices against it, while the only country where it is a regular procedure is for it.  

&gt;Then maybe I‚Äôm not objective because I‚Äôm circumcised and I‚Äôm very grateful to my parents.  

I would be grateful to my parents, if they would leave that choice to me.  
And that is the whole point.  
One side says it's good for health benefits and the other side says, you lose natural lubrication and pleasure.  
It's endless and useless, since the people who are cut will never be able to experience the other side.  
However those who are not cut, still have that possibility.  
They can just get surgery and find out.  
Because their parents let them decide!",,/r/europe/comments/jt20wm/proposal_to_ban_male_circumcision_scrapped_from/gc9gsst/,Thelonyous,1605370786

As with most such things, somebody pulled it out of their ass, and everyone immediately agreed it sounded wonderful.

Hell, the minister in charge of signing mandatory admixing of palm oil into gasoline into law even came out recently admitting she didn't have a clue what biofuel really was at the time. I can't for the life of me find the article now though.

&gt;Until petroleum fuels are completely banned

This here mindset is the problem. Everything is becoming electric in a hurry. Why this obsession with banning and destroying? Why not just let the market do its thing? Sure, set up incentives, whatever. But electric is replacing liquid fuels anyway.

Not that it fucking matters. It's not about the environment; not really. It's about the thrill of power and fucking with people. When 99% drive electric, the environmentalists among us will start pushing for something else instead.

You can see it in Oslo; one of the most electrified places on Earth. What happened after hordes of people had hopped to electric? The Greens started an all-out war on parking spaces, removing electric charging spots, and so on. ""Cars are so pass√©! They take up so much space!""

Therefore, a further decline in the number of demonstrators should be expected, possibly until the protests completely die down.

Just for clarity, the picture you shared never says Turkish - it actually uses the Macedonian wording for Turkic (–æ–¥ —Ç—É—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –≥—Ä—É–ø–∞ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∏).

5099,"So the project I am talking about are called banlieue (ban 'jurisdiction' + lieue 'league') which is the French equivalent to a suburb. But unlike a a suburb, a banlleue is usually seen in a negative light. It is where the poor and disenfranchised live. These are huge housing projects from the 60s that are decaying. With aggressive  police surveillance and physical detachment from the city center (the city council makes it extremely difficult for people living in banlleue to get to the city center but cutting public transport spending on these areas), you have young people living in a state of limbo, unable to get out of their situation and being delusional about life. There is a really good book that talks about it but I cant remember its name right now. 

But here is a really good article about it [https://unherd.com/2018/09/french-elite-ignores-apartheid-banlieues/](https://unherd.com/2018/09/french-elite-ignores-apartheid-banlieues/)",Israel,/r/europe/comments/jtgrv4/13th_november_2015_5_years_ago_3_terrorists_enter/gc8g6wr/,worlddones,1605338188

No. Lock them up just like everyone is locked up now. And if they get to a hospital let them die humanely and without trying to desperately get another month at the nursing home out of them, easing the stress on the health system.

Nagorno Karbakh's claim for independence via referendum and declaration predates the war. It should have been either recognised or negotiated then and there without a response of conflict, turning this in to a matter of survival.

Azerbaijan always had a peaceful path of reclaiming the surrounding territories for decades. Recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh in exchange for the surrounding territories.

5321,"&gt; It kind of matters when using it for electricity directly doesn't waste &gt;50% of it, more than doubling its costs and carbon footprint in the process.

It doesn't matter because we need to set aside some capacity to produce feedstock for the industry anyway, and since renewable kWhs cost 1/4 of nuclear ones it's still a bargain at double the cost, and double a carbon footprint of zero is still zero.

&gt;No, but we are obligated to significantly decarbonize grid electricity before specifically deploying a technology that directly feeds into it and wastes more than half of it.

It's not waste if it produces carbon neutral fuel.

&gt;So, to create flexibility, you invest significant amounts of money into a process that gives you final energy that emitted &gt;400gCO2/kWh to be produced? Just use fossil gas if you're going to create a process that is just as carbon-intensive anyway. It's cheaper (=more money for low-carbon deployment) and it frees up low-carbon sources that would otherwise be required to feed into this wasteful process.

Synthgas from renewable sources is carbon neutral. I, no, *you* don't know what you're talking about.

&gt;So far ""the market"" has failed to properly decarbonize the electricity sector, let alone the energy sector.

Because we have been working with national grids so far, and very big plants that were mostly built by literal state businesses or at least heavily regulated in the name of energy security if there was a free market in the country at all. And we have barely started with giving price signals about carbon emissions to the market too.

&gt;Governement-guaranteed large projects (which also includes hydro, BTW, the world's #1 renewable source by far) have at least managed to achieve the former.

How amazing, you blame the market for the bad aspects of the existing situation but praise the government for the good aspects of the existing situation - il faut le faire.

&gt;Again, if favoring the private market means private actors eating up 50 billions of France's public subsidies only to shit out a measly 20TWh/year of intermittent power, then I don't think that's a good model to follow.

It's not my problem if France fucks up its subsidy schemes.

50 billion is barely enough to subsidize Hinckley Point C, which won't produce more at the expected capacity factor. [When these subsidies are taken together the total cost is likely to be at least ¬£40 billion.](https://www.iisd.org/gsi/subsidy-watch-blog/how-much-again-cost-all-subsidies-hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-plant-should-be) If it gets finished on time and within budget, of course.

&gt;Yes, I'm sure some internet random knows better than the Cour des Comptes... 

I went through it in the past already, there's still some comment of yours that mentions that alone, I'll take it there.

&gt;The life-cycle cost of 80s-era nuclear being lower than your preconceived notion is impossible, it's the others who are wrong.

The French public institutions having a vested interest in painting themselves as at least moderately competent is impossible you say?

&gt;Because, of course, there's no other possible explanation. That other countries' industries manage to build them for cheaper doesn't fit that narrative, though, so let's disregard it.

So we can expect a drop in French wages that make French nuclear plants cheaper then?

&gt;That... still only affects prices, not costs. Which, again, are projected to go up in the EU, not down. 

You think companies aren't putting higher ""costs"" on their bids for public procurements, or bother to go the extra mile to find cheaper suppliers to reduce cost for their customer, if there's no competition? Please.

&gt;You should avoid picking and choosing which arguments you respond to.

If I wasn't complete the answers wouldn't be so bloated.

&gt;Man, you really seem to be into PtG above all else for some reason. If you want to create gas-powered final energy that costs 400gCO2/kWh to make that hard, you should just work for BP or Exxon Mobil.

It's the missing link between the electricity grid and the rest of the energy market. It's going to be necessary sooner or later. You have never proposed and alternative for the need of flexible capacity either.

&gt;Uh, what? Never said it's ""just the same as in the 70s"".France built the base power plants in the 70s. It has upgraded them to have load following capabilities and better safety.
And now you're claiming it's technologically impossible to do that again?

You are the one claiming that you are going to do the equivalent of building *and* upgrading France's entire nuclear plant arsenal in the same time and for the same budget it took to just build them, even though attempts to build a single plant were hopelessly over time and over budget.

&gt;Presumably using cheap, imported production capacity. Not very good for your commercial balance.

Not necessarily, but you were claiming that we should use Asian nuclear firms so you can't hold that against me.

&gt;Nope. You're acting as if your PtG infrastructure is free here, which is obviously nonsense. Assuming LCOE values, either you get 4 times the variable production (which can exceed demand, so useful production would be lower) or you get much less than that and you get some PtG capacity that correspond to the max power output of the renewables you bought.[...]

Then it's 20% of raw kWh + 10% of flexible capacity assuming that funding the PtG plants eat up half of the value of the output.

But like I said already, the main benefit of PtG is the added flexibility, so we will build those plants, regardless. They're never going to be dedicated for grid service exclusively (which would create the inefficiency), they're going to produce whenever they can, and sell their product to the wholesale market, having a competitive edge because theirs is carbon neutral.

&gt;Really doesn't sound like a smart move to me. I'd much rather you spend it all in renewable production, even if it results in overproduction.

That's going to be the initial step, PtG can come whenever it fits in the picture. It's all a step-by-step process where one step enables the next, instead of a plan that requires all its pieces before it can work at all.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/js5kf7/the_most_carbonemitting_power_grids_in_eu27_based/gc7hjuw/,silverionmox,1605313577

5402,"Here's an example. Czechoslovakia was historically major producer of sugar beet. In the interwar period it produced 20% of European beet sugar, 5% worldwide. The peak sugar production was during the late 1920's, over 800 thousands tons a year.

In the access negotiations EU placed quotas upon our production, initially 454,000 tons. [*](http://www.cukr-listy.cz/on_line/2019/PDF/174-177.pdf) During the previous decade, our production was 400 - 600 thousands tons ([stats](http://www.cukr-listy.cz/lc-statistika.html)). In 2006 quotas were reduced to 370,00 tons, due to oversupply. Largest sugar beet refineries were in hand of foreign companies. A French company owning several large plants decided to close those in the Czech Republic, to keep their plants in France w/o change (their quota was transferred).

These refineries had to be physically destroyed  (EU demanded it), and the cost of destruction fell on the Czech state (don't ask, I am not able to explain). [Here](https://www.zvedavec.org/komentare2010/03/3584-zanik-cukrovaru-v-hrochove-tynci.htm) is photo report from destruction of one of the plants, one of the modern ones, located in the middle of traditional sugar beet area. Just take look at the photos, they say everything.

During the worst years, around 2010, production of sugar dropped  to historically lowest level ~350 thousand tons, land used for sugar went down to ~1/2 within decade. Later the production recovered somehow, mainly due to technological progress. The quotas ended in 2017, but by then most of sugar refineries were closed/destroyed, business connections lost and agricultural know-how gone.

This is one example, where EU fucked us thoroughly and destroyed sector we once excelled in.


This overview [article](https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/276106?ln=en) claims, that in Poland, during the same period, ""raw sugar production remained almost unchanged"" and the production of white sugar increased significantly. I don't know how they managed it, but I suspect they didn't allow the Brussels to fuck them over.


&gt; it is a bit puzzling that Czech Republic is not ahead of Poland in PPP. Historically the Czechs had solid industry and relatively advanced society, compared to Poland who had lots of problems with wars


This is result of the genetic trait of the Czech politicians, present since the 1860's. They simply have to act as obedient lackey to whoever is  in power, no matter of consequences and costs.  At the time when Hungarians obtained de facto independence (as Austria-Hungary in 1867), Czech political elites believed their never ending loyalty to the Emperor will be rewarded with some kind of autonomy. They ended up with empty hands.

After WWII ruling communists attempted to outsoviet the Soviets, by nationalizing almost everything, even going against Soviet recommendations to be cautious and moderate. This caused a massive damage to the economy that took decades to repair.

During the 1990's the dominating political slogan was ""return to Europe"". Czechs were sure their country  is going to be the next Switzerland, now when these inept communists are gone.

Protected by this umbrella  of empty words,  Czech politicians were willing to sacrifice anything. Stories I'd heard are incredible. For example, it was demanded (in order to enter some international business org) to liquidate a special steel producer, a very dangerous competitor. This was accomplished by privatizing the huge plant into hands of penniless and crazy crook, who managed to bankrupt it in no time. I quite believe this hearsay, it fits well with the events.

Negotiations with the EU were guided by the same lackeyism. Agree to everything, show how obedient guy we are,  just to get in.

5427,"You're here condemning free speech by saying that then they wonder why they're being attacked... Isn't that indirectly condoning the murder of hundred of innocent people because some people can't live with european laws?

Your argument reminds me of people who say it's the victims fault when they get raped tbh...


I don't care how anyone interprets their religion. Everyone can have their own or no one for all I care. But the person is choosing to follow it and shouldn't try to force their beliefs down other people's throats. No one is forcing you to say ""fuck Mohammed"" or make a drawing of him. If you feel offended by those who do it, move on or get them to court.

What they can't do is take away other people's rights. And that includes satiric stances against every single thing, religion included.  It was done amidst dictators ( to said dictators) and shouldn't certainly be taken away because there are people who might feel so offended. ( But again, if you think it isnt satiric and is an hate crime... Get them to court).

The problem isn't the drawing, it isn't saying fuck off to wtv and also isn't the people doing it.
The problem are those that think you  should murder people over it or that think those murdered are somewhat justified because they were ""tempted"". 

So imo people saying that ""Then they wonder why terrorists do these kind of attacks, lol"" ( your ""argument"" ) are part of the problem too - there's no justification for murdering people because you felt offended. Zero.

Them being snowflakes that don't understand basic human rights isn't a reason to take away freedom of speech. 
Murder is in another galaxy of importance and no one should give in to threats. Certainly not to those that put our ways of living at risk and that's why I personally think that Muhammed's drawings should be printed everywhere all the time. Make them so common that they become white noise, like the black lungs photos on the tobacco packages. 

What no one can do is try to silence or take away the rights of entire countries because someone might be a snow flake that can't deal with a drawing or a ""fuck off"". 
So, instead of saying ""then they wonder why..."" maybe realize that any sane person would wonder why the life of hundreds of innocent people are at risk because someone made a drawing.",,/r/europe/comments/jtgrv4/13th_november_2015_5_years_ago_3_terrorists_enter/gc74rcz/,ihavenoidea1001,1605306395

5465,"I do find it deeply problematic that because a community isn‚Äôt religious that other communities should follow suit. How about everyone minds their own business without being hateful or disrespectful to others. This is essentially the problem. The most backlash and hate I‚Äôve received on Reddit for defending Islam mostly came from atheists and white supremacists. I am aware that not all caucasian French people think this way but the problem is that those who do have louder and voices on the internet and in news outlets. 
You make Islam sound as if we‚Äôre all connected mentally and there was an alert or a bounty on that teacher's head this is ridiculous, when 1% fucks it up for the other 99% then that‚Äôs a problem and that‚Äôs not normal. Blasphemy and drawing cartoons of a prophet is absolutely not the same thing my man. Non-religious people shouldn‚Äôt make rules or judge religious people. Why would we reform our religion? Can you hear just how ignorant that sounds? As if Hitler just proposed to reform Judaism everything would‚Äôve been fine. I feel like most people who think like you just haven‚Äôt been exposed to Muslims or just had bad relationships with them or get their news from the same outlets that have an issue with the burkini hijab and not fucking showering in a collective shower. It‚Äôs ridiculous that I had to leave my country‚Äôs sub because islamophobia is disguised as secularism. It‚Äôs ridiculous that I have to defend Islam every single time a fucking terrorist decides to fuck shit up. A continent doesn‚Äôt have a religion, I‚Äôm French and Muslim and nothing‚Äôs ever gonna change that. Islam has been caricatured into this cult. And the worst thing is that people like you just eat this shit up. Whenever there‚Äôs a scandal like rape and pedophilia in churches nowadays the stories always get buried, I know that Europe‚Äôs values don‚Äôt agree with that. Does that mean that Christianity doesn‚Äôt have its place in Europe? 
Just FYI the docs who developed the Pfizer covid vaccine are kids of Turkish immigrants and guess what... THEY‚ÄôRE MUSLIM. I propose that anyone who thinks Muslims don‚Äôt have a place in Europe should opt-out of the vaccine since it‚Äôs made by people who don‚Äôt share the same values.

5469,"Good question, it's a bit tricky but not impossible! I'd say the most evidence we get is from how the Romans heard and wrote down Greek words: for example, they wrote ""Athenai"" for ""ŒëŒ∏·øÜŒΩŒ±Œπ"" (Athens), but in mod. Greek that'd be pronounced ""Athine"" . This means that ""Œ∑"" was pronounced as ""e"" (in fact, a long ""e"") instead of ""i"", and that ""Œ±Œπ"" was actually the diphthong ""ai"" instead of an ""e"". Now this is just one example, but you get the idea: do this with thousands of Greek loanwords to Latin, as well as to other languages, or even with words Greek borrowed from Latin, Persian, Sanskrit etc. After comparing them, you have a pretty concise idea of what anc. Greek sounded like.

But there's more evidence, for example some authors have described how things were pronounced, and we even know some anc. Greek onomatopoeic words: in one of Cratinus' plays, he writes that sheep sound like ""Œ≤·øÜ Œ≤·øÜ"" or ""vi vi"" in mod. Greek. Not gonna lie, ""vi vi"" is the stupidest sound a sheep could make! It would make much more sense if it were pronuced as ""bƒì bƒì"" like in most languages of the world, and in fact it is. Or if you're not convinced just think about this:

Why would the anc. Greeks create the first alphabet in the world and instead of having 1 letter per 1 sound they had 7 combinations (Œπ, Œ∑, œÖ, ŒµŒπ, ŒøŒπ, œÖŒπ, ·øÉ) that all sounded like ""i"" according to mod. Greek pronunciation?! Well, because each letter indeed corresponded to 1 sound (mostly). In fact, mod. Greek pronunciation is not really close to anc. Greek, because it has undergone several sound changes. Keep in mind that 2500 have passed since then (if we're talking about Attic Greek). English pronunciation has changed much more in 1000 years than Greek did in 2500!

But sound changes are a natural part of every language. Some Greeks have trouble understanding this, and it's even become a political game: if you go to Greece and start talking anc. Greek the way it actually sounded like, people will start laughing at you and probably call you names. In fact, we're not even taught in school it was pronounced in a way other than like mod. Greek! I only learned this when I was 16 by randomly browsing Wikipedia.

If you wanna read more, [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_phonology#History_of_the_reconstruction_of_ancient_pronunciation#Reconstruction) is a good place to start. And [here's a video](https://youtu.be/1ithB9SdQcM) of what we think anc. Greek most likely sounded like!

Cummings is deeply unpopular amongst Conservative MPs; many believe he wielded far too much influence over the PM. Additionally, he is disliked by most of the wider population, which has been especially true following the Durham Scandal.

In January 2020, Cummings wrote that he believed his role would be largely redundant within a year, leading many to believe that he would withdraw from his position in late 2020/early 2021. However, recent developments (the proposed promotion of Cain, a loyal friend of Cummings) caused uproar  amongst many Conservative MPs. Rather than leaving during winter 20/21, it looked as though Cummings' position was  in fact being strengthened. However, it appears that Cain's promotion was blocked, causing a clash between Cummings and several Conservatives.

I'm probably going to get downvoted for this but I see issues with this. Should gay people should get the same rights as straight people? Sure, no issues there. What consenting adults do is nobody else's business. But what about the rest of the acronym? TQ+ isn't so simple. Do I believe people should be able to surgically/hormonally change sex? Sure, if they're adults. But what if it's under the legal age? Then I am absolutely against it. Children don't have the capacity to make decisions that can impact them for the rest of their life. How this is allowed to happen blows my mind, and [apparently others' too](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/calls-to-end-transgender-experiment-on-children-k792rfj7d). 

Things like these are the reason why progressives get such huge pushback. First, lumping LGB together with T together with Q was a mistake, because they're not the same sort of thing. Second, I know the thinking on reddit is basically you either unconditionally support LGBTQ+ or you're a homophobe/bigot but thinking in black and white is *always a bad thing*. People can be against certain things, but if you instantly brand them into social pariahs because they disagree with one aspect, they will turn to the only alternative, which is full conservatism.

All products have a timer at which they are discounted. 

Discounts are always 50% to make it easier for cashiers and the people discounting.

Everything fresh like meat or fish only gets discounted on the day it will expire. Everything else depends on how long the expiration time is in general. 

So stuff like potato chips get discounted 14 days ahead for example. But inventory is sold at way more rapid speed then it expires for shelf stuff.

Dairy or other products from the cooled section have like 4 days. But it varies from product to product. 

Fresh vegetables get discounted depending on how much is left at the evening. If we have a lot of bananas left they all get discounted etc. 

The stuff we throw away is kept at absolutely minimal.

Most of the stuff discounted which are not some niche product nobody wanted gets bought so fast and in mass by people. 

Everything which expired and wasn't sold goes to a food bank, except stuff that comes from the cooled section which has to be destroyed because of food safety issues.

This subreddit generally views ""independence"" as positive and ""Brexit"" as negative when they're the same thing.

&gt;It's like saying Canada should go independent from the uk and leave the commonwealth of nations and abolish the monarchy. Nobody would call that independence. Well maybe some brexiteers.

The Commonwealth doesn't control Canada, the empire did though, which is why Canadian independence is a thing that happened (though it was a gradual process). The EU does control the UK, from our laws, to a court that can overrule our own courts. Brexit *is* independence.

&gt;And the north Ireland independence of the UK they wasnt able to veto Brexit or the withdrawl agreement that would cut them off the rest of the UK.

NI does actually have the ability to nullify that element to the withdrawal agreement through the consent mechanism. However, it cannot do so immediately and has to wait four years to do so.

5939,"&gt; The Greens fight against cost effective energy, industry and agriculture has already and is continuing to drive costs up and massively hurts key industries and the wealth of all citizens.

I completely disagree with what you are saying. Do you have any sources for what you are suggesting? For example nulear power plants are NOT cost efficient. Investing in alternative energy sources like solar/wind is going to pay out both for the economy and the environment in the long run. Same with most of the industry and agriculture.

&gt; All these angles that we are such a bad society and need ""fundamental change"" are attached to all green activism connected to agriculture, consumption, resource usage and a general anti-capitalist critique.

Our current way of life and society is not sustainable long term. Huge countries like China and India (and later Africa) are developing and thus the population wants to live more like us. Thus they want a lot more luxus products and are going to work less - thus our ""exploit poorer countries"" way of live isn't really sustainable long term. And well, the some people realize that and try to start going into the right direction rather sooner than later. We know about climate change for decades but nobody did anything. The earlier we started the easier it would have been.

&gt; In recent years that has been massively successful and even led to EU regulation cracking down on agriculture, car industry and CO2 connected price increases. 

And again - it is necessary. Not just because of the environment but for the economy too. Alternatives to CO2-cars are the future. The german car industry NEEDS to invest more - otherwise the are running into huge problems long term. Some countries forced them to - which is a good thing long term. Otherwise a similar thing to e.g. Nokia (leader of the mobile phone market, now dead) would have happened.

&gt; I think there is no question that it makes everyone poorer and our economy less dynamic

I completely disagree. Where do you get that? What the Greens are suggest is looking at it more long term. Invest a bit more now and be way better of in a few years/decades.

&gt; you see for example in general EU growth problems and troubles on the horizon.

The EU and especially Germany growth problems have almost nothing to do with that. Its even the contrary - investing in new/different technologies/approaches creates new jobs. The main problem in Germany is that we are at almost full employment - which makes it really hard to grow.

I work a lot with low/mid-level management in big companies. If i give them the choice of a) Invest x now and safe 2-3 times the amount in the next few years or b) keep it as is - almost all go for option b). They need good numbers NOW, who cares about the next 2-3 years? Which is REALLY innefficient and bad in the long run!

Some other points. The Greens or left parties in general have a lot of ideas and suggestions on how to improve the life of poorer people and want to improve their situation (e.g. base income). The approach of conservatives ""keep it as is"" is bad for poor people and mostly helps rich people (its easier to make more money the more money you have, you are screwed if you don't have money). In the last years/decades the rich got richer and the poor poorer. Who was in the governement again?

Your opinion makes me kinda sad and reminds me of the US. The republicans make a politic that benefits mostly really rich people but get supported a lot by poor people that would benefit a lot more from the democrats (Free eduction/Healthcare/unemployment benefits/...). But seems like cutting taxes (that benefits mostly rich people) and cutting benefits for poorer people is fine. We need to keep the billionares rich!
