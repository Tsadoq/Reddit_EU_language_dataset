95,"&gt;UN predicts 100.000, of which, considering Rasul-Ayn and rural side of Tal-abyad is arab; at least half of which would be arabs. Thats what happens in wars. People get displaced. Its not ethnic cleansing. 300.000 kurdish refugees inside Turkey will return there.

You start it off with some bullshit here. First off, up to 300,000 people have already been displaced since this recent invasion, and up to another 300,000 had to flee from Afrin when Turkey invaded there in 2018.

As for your 300,000 Kurdish refugees inside of Turkey, that was when they fled Kobane and nearby areas from ISIS in 2014. Since then, many of those refugees had already returned to Northern Syria. This recent invasion has no doubt caused most that returned to flee once again, but this time towards Iraqi Kurdistan and other parts of Syria.

It is ethnic cleansing, Turkey pushed out local residents and wants to supplant millions of Syrian Arabs there, drastically changing the demographics of the region.

&gt;For Afrin, it was simply Syrians going back to Syria. After the battle, no one- literally no one- was forced out. Those that left as SDF retreated couldn't come back, yes but we are not gonna fucking evict the people who fought with us for those that sided with enemy.

Again, hundreds of thousands had to flee from Afrin, and numerous war crimes have been committed there by the TFSA and Turkish forces.

&gt;Also, Syrians in syria, its their country. Do you even realize what kind of a fucked up statement to suggest that Afrin belongs to a spesific ethnicity, and other syrians have no place there ?

Don't play stupid, you know that different ethnic groups in a lot of middle eastern countries don't mix perfectly, and changing demographics that way is illegal. The former Ottoman Empire has a long history of doing this too.

&gt;Ypg when they captured towns, forced arabs out. Those arabs are in Turkey now. He said they will be able to go back to their homes.

Only 25 families were ever forced out of their homes by the YPG, and the amnesty international report accusations corroborate that the displacements were due to military necessity because of ISIS fighters still operating from where the civilians were displaced.

&gt;Those that did the executions on M4 are in custody waiting trial.

Literally no evidence of this.

&gt;Man go fuck yourself. Both Raqqa by US, Aleppo by Russia was levelled to the ground. Compared to those, Turkey is by far the most humane in terms of strikes.

In our countries here in rich Europe, the family unit is small, children, parents, and to a less extent grandparents. In Sudan, the family unit is massive encompassing far distant relations. Why is that? Because the process of industrialization and its associated urbanization removed the need for an extended family and the security it brought in agrarian village life. This is just on of the ways that economy shapes culture.

That is incorrect use of Latin. Quite horrendously too. When you ***try*** and appear smart, be sure not to use words or phrases you don't understand.

2. You failed to answer a very easy question. As such I must assume you are completely unaware that there is a difference between the EU and the UN. This shows an utter lack of primary levels of education. I highly advice you to quickly solve that before you hurt yourself in confusion over very basic western concepts.

3. The fact that you try and invoke a very basic part of international law, as a justification that international law cannot exist, is so horrendously stupid I genuinely don't have the words for it. It'd be funny if it didn't startle me you possibly have the right to vote.

260,"&gt;But that does not contradict my previous point. The fact that there is a political party that is able to have any success at all with their islamist goals is troubling.The very existence of ghettos like Mollenbeek is an evidence that even at current rate, integration is not 100% succesful. And is I've said, the immigration will get much more serious in coming years and decades.    

As I said in my edit (you might've missed it or thought it didn't address this issue which is fine, I'll expand), I agree with you on this issue, but I don't see that as their culture being incompatible with ours, I see it as a failure of our society.       

Back in the 60s and 70s when Flemish people started getting improved qualities of life we saw labor shortages develop for things like mining and other dirty menial labor. We solved this by essentially allowing huge droves of migrants from mostly Muslim countries to migrate to our country to fill those jobs.   

The issue? The jobs they were here to do were of course poorly paid which means that while their lives improved compared to their homeland, they were still at the very bottom of our social ladder.     
    
Government in the 70s and 80s (and even the 90s) of course cared very little about it. After all, to be the poor working part of our society was what they were brought here to do.   
Now what do poor people do, especially in a foreign country? They congregate in the poorest neighborhoods such as Molenbeek.    

And as you probably know, poverty is a cycle of generations. For a child growing up in poverty, it's far harder to work themselves out of it than a child in an average family, especially when that child has foreign parents who work long hours who likely are little help with school work.    
   

An added fact, in Antwerp we have what we call ""the Jewish quarters"". It's a neighborhood occupied almost exclusively by orthodox Jews who live lives extremely far removed from regular Belgian society compared to normal Belgians. They're mostly Eastern European so should be part of the European culture OP was talking about yet I wouldn't know a thing about their lives and they live 50km away from me.    

All in all this is a long post to essentially say that I agree that neighborhoods such as Molenbeek are an issue. But I don't agree that religion or culture is the determining factor in their existence. I think structural poverty and our governments ignloring the needs of the migrants from the 70s and 80s played a far bigger role.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/dkm5d9/european_statistics/f4j3f7j/,SuckMyBike,1571612616

306,"&gt; Of course not. If most people in the EU council were from Sweden it wouldnt be particularly fair 

I don't want more people from my country ruling the EU. I don't want anything to do with the EU. Ofcourse it wouldn't be fair if Sweden ruled over Europe, but it is equally unfair for Germany and France to do so.

&gt; If you dislike the way the EU works then you would have to think the same way about your regional/national politics. Because obviously only a small amount of members in your national parliament would be from your region 

Intresting you should bring that up. First off this is something that I do have a lot to think about and do percieve as a problem, and the EU is adding another massive layer of this. Rather then just trying to get the intrests of your region across to your nation, now you might have to get it across to all of the EU.

 I want a more direct democracy that is split into more regions where the regions have more autonomy. Switzerland is a great example of a better political system despite not being perfect. I see representetive centralized democracy as choosing between a few dictators and their parties. Once their in power you can't really do anything and they might deliver on their promises or they might not. And certain parties might favor certain regions of the country and the party that will win is the one that favors the regions with the most people. 

I come from Lappland in northern in Sweden. It is poor compared to the rest of Sweden despite having a lot of Swedens resources. Mines, timber and wood industries, hydro energy etc. But the profits of theese resources go to places like Stockholm, leaving us needing of welfare. And then the people in the bigger cities don't want to pay out money to keep alive places like Lappland. And there is a lot more people in the bigger cities down south that profit from this stuff then there is people in Lappland. But we don't really have much of a say in it beacuse of the government not representing our region.

Problems like theese can be way worse in other countries where people in actually rich regions basicly starve.

I want the people to have much much more power. Voting for a quasi dictator that doesn't care about you is not a good system imo. Ofc we need a centralized government of some sort.

331,"Not rotten, unless you believe ""becoming rich"" and ""having freedom"" means ""rotten"". Nearly all countries at the same development level as Europe have low fertility rates. This is true for South Korea (1.17), Japan (1.44), and even China (1.62), i.e. countries with vastly different cultural outlook than Europe. 

Women who are allowed to make decisions about pregnancy and their careers will tend to have fewer children, because pursuing a prominent career means sacrificing family life to a certain degree. 

We can try to mitigate it with good support for couples (accessible housing, childcare etc.), but don't be so naive as to think this would push total fertility rate over 2.0. Most likely we wouldn't even get to 1.8. 

The ultimate solution is technological progress ‚Äì once people's productive healthy lives are prolonged from today's about 50 or 60 years to 80 or 90; once automation brings benefits in terms of far more free time to devote to raising children, then people will start having more children again. Until then, a little population decline won't hurt.

The only problem is dealing with the fertility imbalances between the developed and developing countries and ensuring Europe keeps its cultural heritage and European character (and yes, that means low immigration from other places; we don't need to postpone the problem of adapting to demographic decline by importing people from other cultures who will never properly integrate).",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/dkm5d9/european_statistics/f4ij0kt/,Victor_D,1571604891

400,"It's called the martyr's statue. Dedicated to the 150~500 people murdered under bolshevik rule in 1919. The problem is we don't know how many of them were martyred because of their political opninions and how many of them were simple criminals because the new regime wanted to put a big number on it. (Previosly the place was occupied by the statue of Imre Nagy, prime minister of the revolution in 1956, built by donations. The ruling party tries to erase him too from history but I try to stay on subject.)

The statue was erected in 1934 under prime minister Gyula G√∂mb√∂s, noted fan of Mussolini and Salazar. The Numerus Clausus law against jews was already in effect since 1920 and the second law will come in 4 years. During the unveiling the head of state Mikl√≥s Horthy, prince J√≥zsef Habsburg, the clergy and other notable persons of the state were represent. The epigraph also confuses the reader on purpose because it   ""commemorates"" the martyrs between october 31. 1918. and august 6. 1919. So it equates the social democrat governments with the bolshevik one. 

Also interesting that the martyrs of the white terror didn't get such memorial statue (in fact nothing at all). The martyr's number range from  1000~5000 here. It's a pretty huge gap because while the red terror was documented, the white terrorists had free reign for two years not just against bolsheviks, but social democrats, anyone who they thought was left-leaning and of course jews until the Western powers put a stop to it. Also the prosecutor was ordered to ""let go"" these cases and later they got amnesty from the state.

And this is not the first ""oops"" from the current ruling party. A year ago they promoted a book which called Iv√°n H√©jjas (who's group raped, murdered, carried out pogroms in my area aswell) a national hero. 

So yeah, can't wait till we can finally topple this fake memorial along with the statue of Istv√°n Tisza and the revisionist memorial of the victims of german occupation.",,/r/europe/comments/dk8bt1/reconstruction_of_the_former_ministry_of_finance/f4hxe4c/,Kalistefo,1571597349

429,"&gt;The economy isn't good but for the moment it isn't bad either, we've known a lot worse. 

It is not the worst but it is not like the growth, the trade balance and the budget balance were sharp enough to withstand the blow of a hard Brexit. Macron's weakness is, even if the GDP is growing and joblessness is slowly ebbing, he is allowed a very narrow margin of error. He has campaigned and reformed upon the mantra that this (him) will revitalize the economy. No matter if his reforms were good or not, needed or not, but if the economy isn't growing in the 12 months leading to the next election, it will be hard to defend them. Moreover the State deficit is already quite big, adding brexit-related compensating measures will not help.

&gt;Also it might earn him some points within France.

Will it? IIRC, French people arn't distracted for long with foreign relation. President Holland had bloody terrotist attacks and launched several military campaigns that proped him for a while in the ratings but not enough to prevent him from falling into the abyss.

But Macron is arguably looking after some EU reforms, if vetoing will not have any major consequences on the short-term, pushing the UK out will.

Beside the impact on the French economy, the UK being worth 5% of the French export, I believe it will alienate Ireland or the Netherlands, even Denmark and potentially Germany, that are trade-focused. It also happens that the two former are opposed to Macron's fiscal reform and tax convergence. So I believe he will not take the risk to jeopardize his weak chances to reform the EU by having two required votes to turn hostile.

&gt;Sorry but I don't really see what kind of consequences come from blocking Macedonia and Albania that would latter impact Macron himself. This isn't enough for him to gain anything on the nationnal level. This barely interest anyone here. 

I understand it as such as well albeit some member States that were favorable to new small member States may show resistance to Macron's european vision in response.",,/r/europe/comments/djn3ny/france_denmark_and_netherlands_block_albanias_eu/f4hy42t/,CJprima,1571597626

Military intervention is not the only way to project power and influence. In fact, it's probably one of the worst nowadays.

Not in the strictest sense no, but America *undeniably* benefited from HAVING hegemony. The biggest foreign adventure America embarked on (WW2) is what turned America into a superpower and what gave America the influence to shape the rest of the world in ways that benefited it. 

&gt; one must ask the question: If Europe is so unwilling to defend itself, then why should we care?

I think you misunderstand. The issue isn't ""Why should we care about the fate of Europeans?""  but rather ""What do we stand to lose if Europe (or some other part of the world) falls to an ideology that is in opposition to our own?""

You're seeing it as charity, but there are real, beneficial geopolitical effects to those investments. If you seriously think the world order as established by the US after 1945 was just something they did out of the goodness of their hearts, then well, that's pretty naive.

496,"&gt;the reason why the Baltic countries are the ones pushing hardest for this is because, much like the Russians with the Soviets, your countries are trying to whitewash the Estonian Legion, the Latvian Legion, the Lithuanian Activists' Front and other collaborators.

Why would they be whitewashing them? There are different viewpoints on these events even internally, and at least the Estonian government has distanced themselves from these altogether. I have no sympathies towards people that murdered their fellow citizens, including children, no matter if they claimed to 'actually' fight against commies.

What is more, people too often mash all Baltic countries into one entity, but we are not as similar as you sometimes see us. I have no idea about Holocaust or nazi collaboration in Lithuania, which means even if the article was making a point, it wouldn't be automatically applicable to Estonia and Latvia.

&gt;But I think it's dishonest that they do that, and I think Baltic people screaming about how much they suffered in threads that have nothing to do with them is a bit pathetic.

Yes, it's pathetic that *some* Baltic people do that, but there's no myth-building behind it. Rather, it's plain ignorance.

538,"&gt; Nah, if you guys are not up for this idea, then it is dead. :-/

There is lots of value to be found in cooperation, just not forced cooperation and top down directives.

Let's start over with 28 independent countries and no union. It won't be long before culturally similar countries with comparable standards of living will mutually find ways to cooperate. It really doesn't make sense for, say, Sweden and Denmark to keep the borders to each other closed, so they will strike a deal pretty quickly and perhaps start a Benelux-like Scandinavian union.

Then countries will start working together on international law enforcement, scientific research and space exploration, remove customs checks and other trade barriers, sync up their currencies if it makes economic sense to do so, etc.

Within a few years, most of the economic benefits of the EU will be replicated, at least among the successful core and Nordic countries, and only as far as they trust each other. For instance, France and Germany would make economic deals but their political outlook is so different that shared legislation (such as Article 13) would be out of the question.

Periphery countries would have an incentive to get their house in order in terms of corruption so they can make trade deals with the core, but the borders would remain closed - ultimately, it is up to the Bulgarian people to fix their own economy and find a path to economic success instead of running away (and conversely, it is up to the German people to take the necessary steps to remain competitive instead of importing low wage workers).

In the end, trade between trusting parties would proceed as it does now, but individual countries have much more of an incentive to fix their problems instead of free riding. Seems ideal, no?",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/dkhty7/we_know_brexit_is_tiring_but_hundreds_of/f4he3ws/,EnaiSiaion,1571590580

566,"&gt; Did common people actually knew who their king was ? 

Yes. They weren't aware of the exact moment when the ruler changed, but they'd find out soon. 

&gt; Did they care at all ?

Well, the rulers were taking their money, produce and occasionally took them to armies. They couldn't just ignore them.

&gt; They didn't realy have maps at the time, how did they know where the border was ?

Basically, your country ended at the point where your ruler couldn't collect taxes anymore. Sometimes there would be some kind of border fortification at that point, more often there wouldn't.

&gt; How stable were the feudal allegiances ?

Not all countries had that type of feudalism. In those who have had, it was simpler than in High Middle Age, but still a clusterfuck. It was a complex network of loyalties and obligations, more akin to modern mafias than to modern states.

&gt; What about the languages ?

Nobody cared. Nearly all the documents were written in Latin or Greek anyway. As for the subjects, as long as they understood what you were telling them to do it didn't matter which language they spoke.

&gt; More importantly, from a historical point of view, how is the ""density of first-hand sources ?

The Byzantine legal corpus is actually almost completely preserved and we know exactly how the empire worked. Sources from Western Europe and Islamic States are more scarce, but we still can follow the developments in them reasonably well; their ""dark age"" ended with Charlemagne and Abbasid Caliphate. In Slavic and Ugro-Finnic lands the dark age was still in full swing and a lot of our ""knowledge"" about them are at best educated guesses.

567,"How about reading the transcript of the *Posen speeches* yourself?

All right, here's a quick breakdown of Himmler's worldview on the relevant topic: 

""Some people are first-rate humans and hence deserve first-rate human rights. Other people are second-rate humans belonging to 'auxiliary peoples' and whether they deserve first-rate or second-rate rights depends on their status: If they're useful and productive, they're tier-1; if not, we're free to dispose of them as we see fit. Lastly, there are people like the Jews, some Slavs (mainly the eastern ones) as well as terrorists, saboteurs, communists, liberals, humanitarians, faggots, cripples and people with deficient biological functions that aren't humans at all and hence deserve no rights whatsoever because they're either wrongful life to start with or are obstructing the execution of the natural order of the world. The task of a proper National Socialist Judiciary is to sort things out and render verdicts accordingly, because that's how the rule of law works: May all get their due.""

The only difference between you and Heinrich Himmler is that Himmler argues from a biological standpoint whilst you argue from a legalistic one. The result is the same, however: Some people get first-rate rights, others none at all.

They didn't, so next GE is going to be interesting to see (no idea what will happen with the Catalan vote).

690,"Check the guys reply about the Euro polling.

Every poll taken over decades indicates complete British apathy towards ever closer union. The remain vote does not represent a pro EU vote. The remain vote represents a misguided idea that the status quo will stay how it is forever. They believe the UK can maintain its current privileged position in the single market, but out of ever closer union forever. Keep the rebate, stay out or schengen, forever avoid having to fully commit to the project while reaping the economic benefits.

They are utterly wrong. And if by some miracle brexit is overturned, it will only be a temporary delay. Because at some point in the future, British euroscepticism will stop holding the project back and we will be forced into a fork, whereby we get the hell out or commit completely. In that day it will be a massive majority for the leave vote.

The problem is at that point the damage of leaving will be even greater than now, as we would have spent even more time inside tying our economy to the continents.

764,"&gt;our economy is fine and is growin

I like how you claim this and at the same time that we have socialism. The mental gymnastics are amazing. The economy is not fine; the structural problems that lead to the crisis weren't yet addressed. Jobs exist but are low-paying and precarious. The country kills innovation through red tape and taxes. The economy might be growing, but that's because the international environment is favourable. Once it turns around, it all goes into shit again.

&gt;the reason we have corruption here is because of socialism. Socialism brings corruption.

We don't have socialism. We have strong worker laws that should be repealed, but that is far from socialism. If you mean the Socialist Party, they are indeed quite corrupt, but they aren't the sole reason. The political system is corrupt to the core and even the people do the same.

&gt;False. thats bullshit thats what happens when you vote in corrupt politics(aka socialism).

922,"1. Exarheia is indeed knowned for that. The place has been a melting pot for far left supporters,activists and in some case terrorists. We are talking about buildings that either are state owned or privatly owned. Is it legal to occupy a place that you dont own?Yes it is. Anarchists are doing it for years, and because of this , because they have stable ""bases""there are some very particular places in Exarheia that is difficult to get by. 

Now we have such anarchists that enter and occupy illegally such places and station refugees or immigrants. Everything is illegal. There were cases that the anarchists demanded pay. 

I dont see why we should let this happen.

2. This dignified alternative solution the uthos is talking about is an ILLEGAL solution. People who applies for asylum, since we dont know whether they are immigrants or refugees and we need to sort this out, need to be stationed in places designated by the state, so it can reach them easily and so it cam always know who is who , where is everybody.

The police is entering and clearing squats because it's illegal. The whole drug operations in exarheia , is a whole other thing. 

3. The previous government left people do illegal stuff. You have to be stupid to support this The new government is talking about moving refugees to open centers, where they could stay in state facilities or hotels , played by the state, while those whose status needs to be sorted out will go o closed facilities, and then will be leaving the country if the state funds out they are not eligible for asylum and are indeed immigrants. 

Again nothing bad. 

4. What do you expect? To keep rejected asylum seekers? Have you seen the Greek state and its economy?How are these people going to live here? SYRIZA did a bad job regarding the evictions, and the whole process was slow, and that's why they evicted only 2000.

5. The thing not if the squats are good or not. The thing is whether or not its illegal. As I said there is a plan on where to move the people who were evicted by the illgelay occupied squats .

975,"&gt; I work in finance and the financial markets. I've seen a bunch of the predictions that are extremely dire and then ones that are catastrophic.
   
I agree, there is absolutely no upside to it. None. I'm fortunate enough to not have to work so I won't be directly affected in the way that others will but it pains me that those cunts in Downing Street are wantonly inflicting a deliberate act of self-harm on the UK and it's people. All for the sake of keeping the Tory party together, for now at least.
   
&gt; What about it? It's inconsequential, they will eventually bow before our greatness and beg to do business with us.
   
It's only inconsequential until it becomes consequential ... see below.
   
&gt; Yea that is what they want. Leave at any cost.
   
I partially agree with that and I think this is where you can have a realistic argument for a Confirmatory Referendum on any potential deal - surely more democracy can't be a bad thing can it? Surely the will of the people needs to be respected, right?
   
I think that many Leavers at the time of the vote wanted to leave at any cost but, as the consequences for working people become clearer (you know job losses, economic hardship, less investment so less opportunities etc.) I wonder if those same people would still have voted leave (and would confirm that vote if given the chance) if they knew those consequences were to be felt by them personally or their children or grand-children.
   
For example; I wonder if all those Nissan workers in Sunderland (or all those older people in Sunderland who have children or grand-children working in the business) who voted Leave would still think it's a good idea. Substitute Nissan for Honda and Sunderland for Swindon etc. etc. mix and match your industries and towns. 
   
Or how about the fruit grower (who used lots of Eastern European labour to gather his harvest in my part of the country) who voted Leave to 'end immigration' then began complaining loudly that he couldn't get any workers to pick his fruit because EU workers didn't want to come here. 'They have to come from somewhere' he said ... if only he'd thought about that before. Is it reasonable to give people like him a chance to change his mind?
   
Or how about, and I kid you not, the couple who retired to Spain and flew back to vote for the Brexit party in the EU elections because they 'wanted to end immigration'. If only they could have seen the consequences for themselves. Is it reasonable to ask them if again based on what's being proposed? 
   
&gt;I do hope they revoke article 50 before the deadline, 
   
For me, revoking would be the ideal solution but there's no political appetite in HoC ...yet, so it's not likely.
   
&gt;otherwise I want BREXIT!
   
Sure, I understand that people like yourself and many others want and end to the uncertainty but as I'm sure you know, leaving the EU (no matter how) is only the start of more uncertainty and more difficult, complex negotiations in which the UK will have little to no leverage which will last for years if not decades.
   
&gt;A lot of them will be dead, the others will still be saying that the wete special and the EU is evil and conspired to thwart their greatness.
   
Yep, lots of them have already gone plus the fact that there are around two to three million young people who have become eligible to vote since the referendum - they are not the demographic the Tory party appeals to.
   
&gt;the others will still be saying that the wete special and the EU is evil and conspired to thwart their greatness.

LOOKING FOR A DRUMMER!!!

Name: Absurdah, Lahti

Instrument: Blasting drums
Musical Style: fucking fast blackmetal

We are not looking for a lame trickster for our band, just as long as you can blast the dick out the double pedals. Our musical style is dark and cold nordic metal, like Immortal. We got loads of our own songs... goddamn dark.

Join our band if you're interested in being Norwegian and playing quickly.

1168,"The building is situated at 29/2 Arheolog Ion Casian-Suruceanu Street, on the periphery of the ‚ÄúValea Trandafirilor‚Äù Park, near the Republican Clinical Hospital. In the mid-70s due to the housing needs, local authorities decided to build a block of flats for small family units. It was designed and built between 1978 and 1986 by the architect O. Vronski and the engineer A. Marian, in collaboration with O. Blogu, S. Crani, N. Rebenko and P. Feldman. In terms of structural engineering, the building is an important achievement of 70s-80s ‚Äì all the living units on all 16 levels are designed and built in console, thus enhancing the slender image of the building ‚Äì a rare shape for that time.

After the 90s, these social housings for small family units changed their status into ‚Äúresidential apartments‚Äù after being privatized by the owners. Going back to the time of USSR, we find all architectural design controlled by political authorities‚Äô directives. For that reason, each person had an area of 6 square meters assigned in the concept phase of the project. The principle of the housing unit/housing cell was applied, consisting of two rooms assigned to each two people, with a hall and a bathroom. Communal kitchens, recreation rooms and technical areas were provided on each residential floor. This type of compartmenting represents the reality of the socialist period, when experts had to comply with the imposed rules of the living spaces, without being able to make any changes without approval from authorities. Here is one popular example of space division: eight units with two rooms on each residential level, connected by a circular corridor with common areas, which benefit from natural light. All rooms have access to the terrace.

Approximately 77 meters high, the tower known as ‚ÄúRomanita‚Äù used to be the tallest building in Chisinau. The building consists of 2 basements, ground floor and 22 stories. Its main function is collective accommodation. The circular shape of the building and the long, vertical orientation were influenced by the proximity to ‚ÄúValea Trandafirilor‚Äù Park. The architectural and spatial composition of the cylindrical building includes four floors for utilities (laundry and cleaning room, drying room and other household utility rooms) and 16 residential floors. The two underground levels are built for technical areas.

From a functional point of view, the upper part of the building would be suitable for a two-level coffee bar and an area destined to host tourist trips of the panoramic view of Chisinau.

From a legal point of view, the residential building is divided as follows: the ground floor and the upcoming 3 floors (except for the stairs and utilities) and a part of the housing units (16 residential floors) are privately owned, while the rest of the building (upper floors and technical facilities) are under the administration of the Municipal Enterprise of Housing Fund Management No. 9.",,/r/europe/comments/dkfi9z/romani»õa_collective_housing_tower_built_between/f4e0d6g/,boemul,1571550184

But it is true that within the European Union, we want to regulate too much to make the market more fluid, or integrate countries too far from the EU standard, which costs us in our own country. For example, here in France, we are told that Brussel says this or that, we have to dismember our electricity operator EDF because its production costs are too low for competition or privatize our hydroelectric dams.

However, it seems to me that the European Parliament is only recording the decisions of the European Council. The decisions of the latter are themselves the result of an (unanimous) consensus at the country level.

1354,"&gt; China is the world's second largest economy in the world and has clear expansionist ambitions. 

Not really. China isn't more expansionist than India or other countries with border conflicts. China claims all the regions which it claimed for decades. It's not like they add new territory, which would be what ""expansionist ambitions"" means. In fact if we look at their northern and northwestern borders (Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, etc) the conflicts were solved diplomatically, and AFAIK (but don't quote me on that) they rarely gained more than 50% of what they claimed.

Russia, for example, had expansionist ambitions as they expanded into what they didn't claim before. If Russia claimed the Crimean Peninsula since the day the USSR broke up and didn't legally stop claiming it (as they did in our timeline), then Russia annexing Crimea wouldn't be an expansionist ambition, but the regaining of always claimed territory. Similar how Ukraine annexing Crimea (let's say they could do it) wouldn't be regarded as them having expansionist ambitions as they only regain always claimed territory.

&gt; It is a existential threat.

How exactly? Existential threat means more or less ""threat which threatens the existence of something"". Not sure how China dominating (South-)East Asia threatens the existence of the US.

&gt; Russia is not.

By your usage of ""existential threat"" it might as well may be.

What you regard as existential threat from China is them just being able to go against US interest without the US being able to do much against it. By that reasoning Russia is an existential threat too, though of course a smaller one than China, as the US can't just militarily threaten Russia as they can other regions.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/d9nhz8/us_army_deploying_to_lithuania_with_heavy_armour/f4ctmq7/,CDWEBI,1571533727

Their emergence didn't signal a downturn for their countries' developments (again - not sure about Erdogan, but this certainly holds true for Putin).

The only scenario under which Trump, Orban, Bolsonaro and Kaczy≈Ñski remain in power for an extended period of time is if neoliberalism doesn't die and maintains its toxic influence on democracy and politics. Once that influence is gone a new, desirable alternative ideology will be quick to defeat the separatist reaction. But as long as establishment media will continue to ""explain"" all non-establishment political sentiments with bigotry, Russian meddling and other boogiemen, these alternatives will remain obscure; their growth and development will be stunted by the same forces that the establishment is employing to suppress the separatist right-wing reaction.

The truth is that we have Trump, Johnson, Kaczy≈Ñski and Bolsonaro because of neoliberalism. They are not an alternative to it, but a product of it. If all you do is squeeze capital out of the poor and lie to them about the very lives they are living, about the experiences they are having then obviously they will get mad.

1421,"Why do you need me to find you citation that there are regularly nights with little wind? Scroll down to there monthly or annual graphs for the (UK's wind generation output)[https://gridwatch.co.uk/Wind]

&gt;No, the more renewables, the lower the chance of a total outage

You've got this backwards. The chances of a random fault on many non-renewable generators all over the country at the same time are very low. The chances of the sun going down and light winds all over the country at the same time are...every few weeks!

&gt;As the price of renewable electricity drops - by increasing efficiency or overproduction at peak production times, that doesn't matter - that also means the price of synthetic gas will become cheaper. 

Low prices due to oversupply don't mean something cost less to produce; it just means it's hard to sell. Hydrogen from electricity is a thermodynamically expensive process, so is likely to remain expensive. Even if it's produced when wholesale energy is cheap, someone's still paying the renewable companies full rate, otherwise they wouldn't have been economic to build. Their business case is based on a guarantee that all their electricity will be bought at an agreed rate, even when it's useless. One way or another society has to pay for that, either through bills or taxes, or for actually paying full rate for the hydrogen. So you see it's a cost shifted elsewhere, not true low cost.

&gt;Meanwhile, nuclear plants are not profitable if they have to do the load following all on their own. 

Indeed, a zero carbon system isn't going to create itself through the profit motive. So we can have subsidise nuclear, or subsidise batteries and gas with carbon capture, or maybe subsidise hydrogen. A public cost for a greater benefit of limiting climate change.

&gt; So they will, inevitably, require flexible complementation

There's not a technical reason that it's inevitable, it's just more cost effective. But it requires less flexibility than renewables for the point that I keep making: the whole country's supply of renewables will regularly drop than far more than a fault trip of one nuclear station, and by far more than the daily peak",,/r/europe/comments/dj4dfg/why_france_is_eyeing_nuclear_power_again/f4c82qa/,StereoMushroom,1571525608

These were deployed in schools, and they allowed even minors to ""vote"". No control or representatives from non-separatists were present and there are multiple instances (recorded) of people voting many times.

It was a laughable farce, made relevant because the inept Spanish PM mister Rajoy decided to send the riot police, when he should have just ignore the results as non legitimate, which would have been true. It's not as if it was the first fake referendum made by Catalan separatists.

Puigdemont is not exiled, either. He is a coward that left his former partners alone while he escaped in the trunk of a car without telling anybody, and now lives in a 4.400‚Ç¨/month palace in Waterloo while desperately seeking regular funding and hopefully a seat in the European Parliament.

1689,"Note that this is actually _not_ about delaying the deal. This amendment is to prevent Johnson and his ERG to sabotage their own deal; The scenario this is supposed to guard against is:

1. Johnson puts deal on table
2. Parliament is desperate for a deal, so agrees to it
3. Benn act stops applying now (because parliament consented to a deal)
4. Legislation for actually ratifying the withdrawal agreement and doing the necessary steps to comply with it is tabled
5. Johnson and ERG block it
6. No deal exit on the 31st because the WA hasn't actually been ratified, and now it's too late to do anything about it

This amendment changes the procedure so that the necessary legislation needs to be agreed first before Johnson can claim parliament has consented to a deal as far as the Benn act is concerned. This means Johnson has to ask for an extension now. Note that the idea with that extension is that _if_ there is a deal agreed _and_ it has been ratified in both the EU and the UK, then the PM should just contact the EU and agree to end the extension early (because then the WA would obviously be in place already, so no need to wait any longer). In practice this wouldn't make the whole Brexit thing take any longer then if the government things it can table and pass the necessary legislation next week (in fact, the whole thing could still be done with before the EU even approves an extension). The only thing that this actually stops is no deal chicanery, which is why a number of people who said they'll vote for the deal also voted for this amendment - including Letwin, the guy who proposed this amendment in the first place.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/dk44eg/brexit_mps_vote_by_322_to_306_to_delay_boris/f4bfhzj/,HKei,1571511682

&gt;By the current agreement, NI will have to abide by quite a few EU regulations. If something is going from the UK to NI, they will have most probably to prove compliance, which is quite funny per se, since they won't have any voting power.

Compliance to what?

The NI will be part of the UK and be in the UK customs union. They won't have to prove compliance to anything in any goods which final destination is NI. 

For goods that have Ireland/EU as final destination, it'd be the same procedure used for goods directly exported from the UK, whatever is decided.

Not really sure what are those ""compliances"" you're thinking, so hard to answer in more detail.

&gt;some regulations require member states to ""do something"" i.e. REACh. Will bodies be appointed in NI? Will NI still have to fund some relevant agencies and EU bodies? Or will they benefit from them for free?

I agree that the status and quality of life of Albania and other aspiring countries should not become better from joining EU, but by itself, by implementing the reforms of the EU and by setting a goal ahead of yourself. That being said, I am not downvoting your comments, someone else is.

 Now, my only concern is regarding to the double standards. As someone from Kosovo, we have experience when dealing with double standards when it comes to visa liberalization. Kosovo worked hard to meet the conditions necessary for visa liberalization and in 2017, the EU council recommended it as it was fulfilled everything they asked for, so we got liberalization, right? Wrong. Now the EU added one more thing to the list: Ratifying the border agreement with Montenegro in parliament. Everyone was shocked, the example of borders was never asked to be a bullet point for any other country that got visa liberalization,ever. People were pissed, nationalists started to gain more support, but in the end, the parliament ratified it in 2018, we lost a bit of land but it was worth it since we got the liberalization finally, right? Wrong. Its been more than a year that everything the EU asked Kosovo to implement was completed, yet it is continuing to be pushed further and further. The german EU representative said liberalization will come ""as a gift for Christmas"" for Kosovars in the end of 2019. But then it was pushed AGAIN, with the excuse that it wasn't a daily matter for this year, ""maybe in 2020"". You can see our frustration i hope, being the only Europeans without visa liberalization even after everything that was asked for us to do was completed.

Then, nationalists always supported a union between Kosovo and Albania, but politicians managed to keep it low by saying: ""We will be united under the curtains of Europe"", meaning that even though it wont be on paper as a ""union"", it will be basically just that, following the open border policy of the EU. And now when politicians come out and say that even though we met the requirements to start negotiations, we were declined because ""we aren't important enough"", nationalists will have another rise saying that ""if we cant be unified under the EU, we should just do it ourselves"", which would be disastrous for everyone.

You can say that Albania did not fulfill the requirements to enter negotiations, but 25/28 EU countries think otherwise, plus high representatives of the EU. They themselves said ""it was a historic mistake"", those are not my words, and you can't help but think why would they think so.",Kosovo,/r/europe/comments/djn3ny/france_denmark_and_netherlands_block_albanias_eu/f4a6q65/,_Negativity_,1571489717

As another commenter pointed out; the U.K. are so caught up in the mess here that even our own politics apart from Brexit are being ignored. A typical viewpoint (IMO) of this country, thinking they are the most important thing ever. 

That is not to say that it is not being covered, it is but you‚Äôll have to scroll down to find the story. I don‚Äôt read all of the press in this country so couldn‚Äôt say what they think, only my own thoughts. 

Personally, I think it is our right to vote on certain things. I think that there should be certain aspects to be taken into account, such as when you be side is spouting complete lies - this is not a comment on Spain but a dig at my own country. 

I think they should have been able to vote on it, the Spanish government were wrong to say no. 

It was illegal however and so should not be counted. 

The reaction of the government was over the top, but on the other hand they are trying to nip it in the bud to stop it in its tracks. (It will never go away).

I believe in our right to protest, I do not think you should be attacking businesses though, you‚Äôre aiming in the wrong direction (IMO). 

The Spanish nationalists have just made things worse, and that could be in part down to El Mundo writing some articles that add fuel to the fire - correct me if I‚Äôm wrong here. 

I think it is a mess. I believe in a united world and us all working together. I like to think (hope) that the EU is a step in this direction. I‚Äôd love to see us all have more power as counties within our countries. More power down to the grassroots and the people. But a series of levels all the way to the EU.

So because it's not relevant the issue doesn't apply to them? The ""legal traps"" (also known as Constitutions) you're complaining about are present in the vast majority of countries.

&gt;There's a difference between ""there's no current legal mechanism for leaving""

There is a legal procedure. Coincidentally it's the same one if you want to permanently abolish Catalonia's autonomy: reform the Constitution. It requires supermajorities for a reason.

It was a political compromise: you get autonomy but you also agree to not split off. 90% of Catalans voted for the 1978 Constitution (and before anyone wants to say that it was that or a dictatorship a ""Ley de Transietoriedad Pol√≠tica"" was passed in 1977, democracy was coming regardless so you can stop repeating that lie).

Thats more of a problem with few isolated users being, well lets say overly optimistic. It doesnt change the fact that the cost of renewables have collapsed and will be cheaper than fossil fuels soon, or already are in a few isolated markets. 

There is also the fact that geography of germany *sucks* for renewables. We have barely any hydro and PV potential and wind potential is only ok. There are many, many countries that are far better suited for renewables, so germany is pretty much the worst-case scenario.

This is just a meme people parrot without actually understanding the changes.

For example, the backstop wasn't just for NI. It provided a ceiling on the regulatory distance between UK and the EU until there was a new deal - the UK would remain part of the customs union potentially ad aeternum. 

May's deal didn't allow for a WTO Brexit down the road for example. This one does. 

Basically, the UK government gained a lot more amplitude to negotiate the future deal.

This was always the main point of Boris Johnson, the ERGs, etc, to May's deals (not NI per se), so it's beyond bizarre to hear people saying it's just about the same.

That wasn't the point of the referendum. That was/is to be decided by the Parliament.

Let me guess this straight: if Remain had won, would you be shrieking about how Remain didn't define all the future and potential versions of the EU, so any change would need to be put to another referendum? 

Absolutely ridiculous. Referendum decides leave or remain; anything else is defined afterwards. 


&gt;The good thing about a second referendum is that people now know exactly what leaving means and what their options are. For example, the options could be remain, leave with no deal, leave with May's deal, leave with Boris' deal.

1.- We complain because the government boicot our economy. For example, the fast train was built in Barcelona 20 years later than in Sevilla and we have very few international flights with asia ( although the companies want to fly here)

There have been large companies who wanted to invest in Catalonia and the government avoided that.


2.- We do not have the same services than in other regions. Our student grants are much lower, etc

3.- The public salaries are not sufficient to live in Catalonia because it is more expensive to live here. Same with unemployment or retirement.

4.- Our laws tend to be more advanced than the spanish, but they have cancelled most of our laws.

For example, in Catalonia shops can't open on sunday to protect the employees, but in Spain that is legal; so now in Barcelona you can see shops opened on Sunday.

And I have more examples, but definetely it's not a bout money . It's about the fact that the government is anty-catalan and some spaniards too.

2302,"&gt; Do you honestly believe coalition forces are just randomly dropping bombs like ww2?

No but we place too faith on precision munitions and WAY too much faith on our intelligence.  We're also impatient when it comes to identifying and analyzing a target and striking it.  In the military we have a mentality that our job is to find and destroy the enemy, once he is located the next question is how to most effectively and quickly eliminate him. Air strikes are often the most obvious answer to that question and provide an immediate result but they have unintended consequences despite our precision capabilities because our intelligence estimates of the damage of a strike is often completely wrong. 

I don't know about all the intelligence and decision making behind this specific strike but I think the pattern of these strikes causing unintended civilian causalities speaks to the issue of how we use them.

Speaking in general, I think in a situation like this an indirect approach is the best approach. A ground unit can surround a car factory and effectively eliminate it as an enemy asset, if supplies can't get into the factory to make bombs and car bombs can't drive out then what good does it serve the enemy? Once surrounded it can be death with a more methodical way with respect to how destroying it will impact the local civilian population AND more importantly how it will affect their view of us and the government we are there to support.

This method is certainly slower, and it puts more Americans or allied troops at risk because we have to physically be there on the ground.  But I believe, to put it bluntly, if the conflict is worth fighting it is worth dying for and that by respecting the interests of the civilian population we can shorten these conflicts.  The US finds itself caught in these seemingly endless wars where the civilian population continuously produces and supports insurgent movements against us and the local government, which is due to our not respecting their interests and desires.  We have to be a human face and see their face to understand them and understand what a conflict is truly being fought over.

  Often times we misunderstand our opponents because we don't engage with them, and in counter insurgency our opponents are the people that live and work in the places we operate.  They are not necessarily our enemies but they can become our enemies by becoming fighters or bomb makers, they can support our enemies with passive or active support by providing food, shelter, a crowd to hide in, and by not cooperating with our efforts to locate insurgent networks.

2369,"I find your conclusion wrong from exactly a geopolitical point of view.  Taiwan's thinning list of countries that are willing to recognize it in lieu of supporting China's economic policies shows that the PRC has every intention of doing to Taiwan what it is currently doing to Hong Kong.

Avoiding the ire of China is simply allowing the PRC to set the conditions it wants to isolate Taiwan diplomatically (right now) economically (beginning) and militarily (if it needs to).  Even now the PRC is actively encouraging Taiwanese to move to China to intertwine their economies, much the same way they did with Hong Kong.

Taiwan is more defensible than Hong Kong (I assume you meant Hong Kong) but it is not invulnerable and it is the constant threat of that invasion that both keeps Taiwan in check from seeking independence but also encourages it to build up its military.  The China-US trade war was the perfect cover for Taiwan to buy a whole new wing of F-16V's and M1 Abrams tanks, after all, something no administration for the last 15 years was willing to consider.

As I said before, Taiwan needs to exploit this opportunity while the world press is focusing on Chinese overreach.

2406,"&gt;""Capacity cost"" is a form of lying. People don't want some abstract capacity watts in misleading formulas. 

For a scientific approach you need comparable values. Fossil fuels often get subsidies and there might be different tax rates, so you have to adjust for that. 

&gt; [powering these with wind and solar energy costs more than with coal.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2018/04/23/if-solar-and-wind-are-so-cheap-why-are-they-making-electricity-more-expensive/#5c3166c11dc6) 

sorry, but that is a horrible source.. He is basically saying that wind and solar are responsible for the recent rise in energy prices when currently most countries only produce a few percent of their energy with renewables.. 

Like the US only produces about 7% of their energy with wind and solar, i can guarantee you that renewables wont have a large impact on overall energy prices with only a few percent..

He then misinterprets a german study [found here](https://www.neon-energie.de/Hirth-2013-Market-Value-Renewables-Solar-Wind-Power-Variability-Price.pdf), which says that with increase of wind and solar the market value of those energy sources decreases with more solar and wind farms being built. Meaning that if I own a wind farm I will make less profit because the energy will get cheaper (=market value). But he thinks a decrease of market value is bad for the consumer even though it means they are paying less money.

Finally he says that countries that produce the most wind energy (Denmark &amp; Germany) have the highest energy prices and cites [this graph here](https://1-stromvergleich.com/electricity-prices-europe/). Again, he didn't seem to read it properly. It clearly says that this graph includes all taxes and levies. You can clearly see in the graph that the energy cost isn't the highest in those countries but the taxes are. It even says that in the text:

&gt;The energy prices in the EU depend on a range of factors, including  taxation, network charges or environmental protection costs. Taxes and  levies make the biggest difference. Residential electricity rates are  taxed at an average of 37%. These values vary greatly from one¬†country  to another,¬†with rates as high as 67% in Denmark and 55% in Germany. 

So the obvious answer to his question why energy prices have gone up in recent years is not because of renewables (which he himself says are cheaper than fossil) but because countries are starting to tax fossil fuels higher in order to move away from fossil to more renewables. So in the short term energy will get more expensive, while we're still using much coal and gas but in the long run, once we have transitioned to more renewables the energy prices will fall again and energy will get much cheaper.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/djj9x5/greta_thunbergs_13yearold_sister_is_struggling/f49065s/,true_king_of_ooo,1571453730

Technically not true. The Spanish Government could authorize the celebration of a referendum in Catalonia right now. A non-binding referendum to know the Catalan population opinion on the issue of independence. Which would already help to understand the situation and how many people actually want independence.

Spanish parties could reach an agreement so that in case the separatists win, then the Spanish Parliament would reform the Constitution to make Catalonia's independence effective. In case unionists win, no need to reform the Spanish Constitution. It's all about politics in reality, not the law. With political will, Catalonia would already have had the referendum.

Depends, but we wouldn't have been here today as we are right now.

I sometimes think ... what if the EU kept the carrot and stick ""of entering the EU"" straight until we had some a few years experience over how to have a independent judicial, a functional DNA (national directorate of anti-corruption), not just reforms on paper, real palpable visible reforms ?

We might have had a better footing, we might haven't had to crawl our way like we did between 2008 - 2015 and still doing, while being in full EU member and at the same time the corrupt political local landscape trying to halt or reverse blatantly, required past reforms by EU, like they tried in 2017 and 2018.

Taiwan will never gain recognition as independent, any country who does so faces massive, massive consequences from China.

Taiwan happens to be far more defensible than Taiwan, and eventually, even the US may have trouble since Beijing's willingness to war over Taiwan may outweigh Washington's will to defend.

What I did like the EU past view on ""accession to EU"" when they started to *poor money* into making the country for small scale local projects trough [PHRAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phare).

Reflecting over it, **it was the worst way to spend money**, like right now we know how those projects can be skewed and the funds diverted by corruption, but the idea, that **we need you to get where we are right now** so you can have a decent emerging economy, there won't be a exodus of corruption, population driven by poor wages or leaving the country brain dead ... to oligarchs that can pull the populism card for their own short time gain.

Also in two years we should have the EPPO (European Public Prosecutor) functional and we already have a functional OLAF.

We should have a new type of development fund (EDF), based on the current form of access to funds based on real needs, written projects that can be followed closely by OLAF and EPPO and don't throw away money out of EU budget for ""hypothetical projects"".

You get some EU money but we want real change and you can't steal or misuse those funds.

Implement real judicial reforms, create a anti-corruption institution, give them independence, and let hem track down high level corruption.

Set a real minimum targets objective over 5 years, as % of the GPD for education and health.

You need to pull your own bootstraps, because the EU can't do it for you. The rest of EU to be a partner not a bully, as we are tried of political crises that keeps us form evolving.

The argument is simple: There is already a default state of affairs (one that Catalans also agreed with, but that‚Äôs not the point), and there are no rules with respect to a referendum the way the independentists want (obviously there is through changes in the constitution etc, but that‚Äôs not the debate as that‚Äôs not in the hands of the Catalans but all of Spain), which implies there is no ‚Äúright way‚Äù to do this, because there are no established rules contrary to all this ‚Äúlook at the Scottish 50% referendum etc‚Äù.

2543,"The problem is this underlying prejudice that because our ancestors did not think in the matho-technological manner we train our children to think in today, they were therefore less skilled, less intelligent, less creative and just overall inferior to people today.

When, as you say, fundamentally the brain is the same. A caveman or cavewoman isn't going to come up with rocket science. But neither will you or I 'come up with rocket science', because even if we'd become rocket scientists, we'd just be building on a vast store of knowledge that many other people worked on before us.

But why should the goal of the caveman be to 'come up with rocket science' to begin with?

That is the second prejudice. This teleological view of history where the whole and only point of humanity is to advance towards technological progress.

But that's not how things work. Cavemen and cavewomen aren't humans too stupid to figure out rocket science. They're just humans, living in a stone age environment, trying to do stone age things.

But by these two prejudices, we keep imagining them as stupid primitives, who are just trying but failing to invent rocket science. Instead of what they actually were: humans, by and large not that less intelligent than the average person today, spending their entire lives making the best of the stone age world they were born into.

No, they wouldn't come up with calculus. But what person today would come up with a spinning disk toy like this? Not that many!

Keep in mind, this isn't just a silly primitive not-camera. It's a toy *that can be made with and works with stone age technology*.

Because if you or me ended up in the stone age, we wouldn't be able to build a modern camera or anything close to that. We wouldn't have the tools, we wouldn't have the materials to make the tools.

Another thing modern people like to take for granted is that a lot of inventions, say something as seemingly simple as the bicycle, actually require levels of metal-working and mining that take at least centuries to develop. It's not just the knowledge, it's the infrastructure providing the materials and manufacturing required to put the knowledge to use.

So, where we'd be completely at a loss in the stone age because all our modern ideas require levels of metallurgy, glassblowing, masonry, etc. etc. that would be completely beyond any of us.... Meanwhile the 'caveman' or 'cavewoman' has figured out how to make a spinning disc toy with just stone age technology. And who knows how many other interesting stone age inventions were made and lost as they became 'obsolete' by newer technologies.",,/r/europe/comments/djng1t/prehistoric_childs_toy_circa_18000_bc_jumping/f48rs1l/,NFB42,1571447082

The Royal Navy was responsible for less than 1% of wood consumption of domestically produced wood and was active in sourcing timber from the Baltics, Sweden, Norway and New England as it saw the necessity to keep a reserve at home. [Source](http://www.wou.edu/history/files/2015/08/Melby-Patrick.pdf) The Royal Navy was wise to manage its forests in accordance of encouraging regeneration of forests for future supplies; avoiding the clearing of forests.

2576,"The tell the catalans to present a reform project at the Congress. According to our Constitution the Regional Parliaments of each Autonomy can present a project of constitutional reform. Wonder what, they haven't even tried in all these years. 

I don't have any problem with having a refer√©ndum, I'm catalan myself. But foreigners should know what happened. Due to the global crisis CiU (Right wing catalan nationalists/bourgeoisie) cut money from social aspects like Healthcare or Education. People got angry and in 2011 a protest called ""Aturem el Parliament"" occured, the goal was to impede catalan MPs from entering the Parliament, president Artur Mas had to get into by helicopter.

From them CiU, which was always nationalist but never exploited the independence card, used it as distraction, in order to create a common enemy that would get the blame for what they do. That's the moment independentism really skyrocketed in Catalonia, yes it existed previously but never was a priority.

Then the lies ensued... ""Of course the EU will accept us"", ""Spain rob us"", ""Catalan is discriminated"", ""The international laws give us the right of self-determination""... 

Then in 2014 Artus Mas called for a first refer√©ndum, the 9N. No one apart from them took it seriously, of course nothing happened after that... 3 years later we had the 1O, nothing really has happened after that. Yesterday Quim Torra announced his desire to call for another referendum... Nothing will happen.

This is just comical at this point, the only thing they have to do is to present a project of constitutional reform, but they won't... Because they never truly wanted independence (CiU, now PDeCat) it was only their scapegoat, but now they created a monster of false hopes and lies.

2602,"&gt; The point I was trying to make was that from the point of view of Catalonian separatists, these sentences are the beginning of a full blown crackdown and repression, and nothing draws more people to a cause than that perception.
&gt; 
&gt; 

As a non-Catalan Spaniard, I'm sort of sorry the judges had no other choice than to give these sentences, because it complicates the situation. But their work is to qualify actions according to the penal code, not to find political solutions. It was clear there would be some sort of penal responsibility though: these guys were repeatedly told they were attempting something illegal, violated the rights of the opposition and parliamentary procedures, disobeyed court orders, embezzled funds to organize the referendum despite repeated warnings, and to top it all declared a sort of fake UDI that caused civil unrest and heavy economic damage to Catalonia. 

This is where the government could act and give a broad amnesty as a step to de-escalate the situation. It wouldn't make much of a difference in practice really because most of them will be out in a few months actually (so as to ease re-insertion, after 1/4th of the sentence they can have semi-freedom, returning to prison only to sleep). It'd be a smart move to avoid further unrest.

I personally simply can not tolerate any nationalism, wherever it comes from, and will always stand opposed. It destroys societies and institutions, and has no place in modern democracy. If and when Europe federates, I would not mind the Catalans splitting into their own federated State, as long as it is through a clear and transparent procedure and certain clear conditions about the ""divorce"" are met. I would not support it, but I would not mind, because if and when we federate, we will presumably have left nationalism behind (or most of it, anyway) so I can trust they would be doing so for the proper reasons (whatever they may be). This would assuage my fears of Spanish-speakers being denied education in Spanish, etc. and as Catalonia would be inside the Union still, there would be no borders and no separations and the Catalan citizens would still enjoy federal democratic protections and participation.","Spain, European Federation",/r/europe/comments/djnaml/catalan_protests_right_now_against_condemning/f48h20e/,NombreGracioso,1571439093

The right to (external) self-determination - involving breaking away from a country is a last resort, it is not a black cheque for any people to split at anytime from a State. As the supreme court of Canada stated regarding thier Quebec situation:

&gt;A state whose government represents the whole of the people or peoples resident within its territory, on a basis of equality and without discrimination, and respects the principles of self-determination in its own internal arrangements, is entitled to the protection under international law of its territorial integrity.

After brexit I honestly don't know how stuff will work, I can't find a simple answer.

2756,"For instance, the knowledge of history of Earth's atmosphere and climate. Early Earth atmosphere had 20% CO2 and no oxygen, the later atmospheres all were very rich in CO2. The fact that the current CO2 levels are not highest in history, they are highest in about 4 million years, but for the most of Earth's history they were much higher - for instance, when the dinosaurs went extinct it was ten times the current value, and poles had tropical forrests growing on them - yet still life thrived, and thrived it did. The fact that increased CO2 levels massively increase plants ability to grow, reducing cultivation times and food costs - or the fact that warming climate opens up possibility of habitation in vast spaces, mostly in north Eurasia, or new sea routes and new animal migration paths.  


There sure are other very negative things that not many people are talking about, such as acidification of the oceans, which most probably will devastate the plankton and hence the whole global food chain, or changes in thermohaline circulation due to influx of fresh water. Some other things are portrayed as catastrophical, yet there is little physical evidence they might happen, such as clathrate ice woes.  


Basically, the whole problem with Greta is that she is oversimplying a complex issue and breaks it down to a catastrophical dealth cult that claims civilization, or even life on Earth, will cease to exist in few decades tops.

2822,"I am one of those green voting urbanite Dutchies, so you may be aware of my bias, but this thread is not doing justice to the complicity of the issue. It's not just ""hurr durr whiny greens are ungrateful shits to farmers"". Many Dutch experts think this issue is become more complex than the Dutch's government plans to reduce CO2 emissions even. Nitrogen emmissions might seem like a nitpick but a whole ton of issues tie in with this.

**Background of the protests, issues with nitrogen emmissions and failing government policy**.  


The Netherlands are the 2nd largest exporter of agricultural produce, after the US. Our exports are worth 90 billion dollars if I'm not mistaken, and that in a country which fits about 234 times in the surface of the US. The US for that matter exported 135 million dollars worth of agricultural products. It has to be recognized that at least in comparison to the rest of the world, we are amongst the top in agricultural productivity and over the past decades, emissions were definitely cut through improved technology.  


The Netherlands however, is still a rather small country and essentially one big city which nevertheless makes us a hotbed of nitrogen emmissions. Important reminder, that this includes ammonia, which is also seen as a type of nitrogen. Furthermore, recent research by an independent research bureau at the request of parliament found that in relative terms, the Netherlands are by far the biggest producer of nitrogen. We produce 50 kg of nitrogen per square hectare, 4x the European average. On top of that, wind ensures that 3x as much nitrogen emissions are blown over our border than we actually take in from foreign countries. This research suggested that agriculture is responsible for 61% of nitrogen emissions, statistics by the National Bureau of Health and Environment keep it at 46%. The environmental problems with nitrogen emmissions are is that ammonia in particular can lead to over-fertilization, disturbing the ecosystems in legally protected areas of nature. And cattle farming has become super intensive in the Netherlands.  


Already many years ago, politicians knew that something had to be done because it would simply become unsustainable in the longer term. So our neoliberal center-right ish governing party, naturally hoped that capitalist innovation and technology would solve the issue in the end. As such, a lawmaker of the Christian Democrats, the main party for farmers, essentially devised a system that would allow permits to farmers if they promised to invest in cleaner technology etc. The only issue was that this ""keep polluting with the promise to pollute less"" was judicially unfeasable, multiple advisory commitees ruled that a judge would shred the plan to peaces predominantly because it wasn't in line with EU environmental regulations on habitats. There 118  nature reserves sensitive to nitrogen which are in pretty bad shape already, so try convincing the local province or a judge that you can continue your activity. No one in parliament was really concerned however, since permissions for economic activity matter not only to agriculture, but also to other sectors like construction. Despite multiple warnings about the flaws in the plan, most MP's just wanted to get it over with. But even though we might be one of the most efficient producers in the world, but because of our density as well as our very intensive cattle farming, you'll still hit a wall eventually. And so a few months back, an environmental agency actually went to a relatively high judge, who in turn shred it to pieces. As a consequence, this halted all immediate processes for provincial permissions, halting not only agriculture, but also construction. And this happens in a time of a large housing shortage, so it is very urgent.  


Yet generally, even before this Christian Democrat plan, farmers were already subjected to heavy regulations and requirements, and here is where other issues tie in. Firstly, these government regulations require investment in new technology. At the same time, supermarkets wield humungous market power in NL and farmers generally really don't get much for their produce. People want their meat and dairy to stay cheap. So in order to justify investments in newer technology, cattle farming in particular becomes more extensive and more concentrated in larger firms, so that the costs can be spread over a larger amount of produce. As a result, despite the investment, farming gets more and more intensive, with emissions continuing. The market is also an issue here. Firstly, the EU recently conceded a trade agreement with Canada, which have to abide by lower standards and regulations, putting pressure on our farmers. Secondly, the agricultural sector has become much like the retail sector in NL, a growing cheap and luxury sector at the cost of the middle sector (my fellow Dutchies should think of V&amp;D and Hudson's Bay in this case.) On the one hand, part of the consumers becomes more and more conscious about the environment and shifts to more sustainable, biological but more expensive produce. On the other, a large demand for cheap food remains, mostly produced by large mass-scale firms. As a result, the middle section of the market is in steep decline, and this section of producers are the family owned companies who on top of these market insecurities have to deal with constant hassle about environmental regulations. So in my view, the cause of the issue is a combination of us reaching what is environmentally sustainable, market mechanisms, and lacking government policy who shoved the issues ahead of themselves, having been warned multiple times that their implemented plan could be shredded at any point in time and who now have to clean up their mess. The Greens however, haven't been in government for years.",,/r/europe/comments/djqcg2/thread_about_the_recent_farmer_protests_in_the_nl/f47mpdi/,TheBittersweetPotato,1571424666

2824,"**Now my points on to the actual protests**  


Because the judge shredded this plan, the local provinces put in temporary but extreme restrictions on the rights of nitrogen emissions. The government is considering voluntarily buying out farmers, and compensating them on the basis of number of animals they are allowed to have stated in their permit, but the provinces are more strict and only want to buy out the farmers on the basis of the actual number of animals, often fewer than farmers are allowed to have. The farmers consider this theft of their pollutions permits, since these plans are of course intended to free up ""pollution space"" to solve the issue so that construction and infrastructural projects can continue again. The 'extreme measures' the author mentions however, refer to this and are thus neither pre-existing nor permanent since the government is still cracking its head over the issue.  


At the same time, the atmosphere at these farmers' protests was often reported to be grim, as they smashed open the doors to a provincial house (house of provincial administration), ran over barricades multiple times, and one farmer was arrested for trying to driver over a mounted police officer with his tractor. The point about the military being deployed is also heavily overblown, they were only employed because time was too short to rent trucks from private companies in order to barricade roads. The author doesn't mention that the farmers initially planned to protest and barricade where the government is seated, interrupting all of their work too. Knowing that these farmers smahed through standard barricades like fences, there was naturally a need to use heavy trucks in order to seal off roads. The military were the only once who had those available in time.

I feel that it is a bit disingenious to say that ER protests aren't grassroots just because they're done by urbanites. I definitely feel like their is somewhat of a double standard. Boomers rejoice when farmers cause 1200km of traffic on the motorways, but call for ER protesters to be beat up when they block one crossing in Amsterdam. Our Dutch variant of the Onion (De Speld) already wrote a satirical piece how ER should have brought tractors. I definitely think there are genuine problems that the farmers are dealing with, but I feel like for a large part they tie in with the protests of ER, the issue of environmental sustainability. But now the Christian Democrats, including the guy who came up with the plan that was recently busted, just scream on a stage how the farmers shouldn't concede to hippies and vegans. These right wing parties essentially just throw supportive slogans to gain votes, whilst having no actual plan for a system that is essentially bankrupt. The Greens in the meantime have pulled back their support for the trade agreement with Canada, which was one of the talking points of the farmers.  


Lastly, this issue also has a post-truth dimension to it. The farmers refuse to see that no matter how well meant their intentions towards sustainable productions are, they are still a problem. They wanted to protest at the National Institute of Health and Environment, firstly saying that their processes aren't transparent. The Institute (RIVM) told them that they are welcome to visit them where they would explain everything to them. And despite some inaccuracy margins in their models, international experts as well as professors have repeatedly state that they still provide an accurate picture overall. The farmers by far are most responsible for nitrogen emissions in NL (46% to 61% depending on the research.) Meanwhile, some farmers said they don't trust the results because they don't agree with them. Or to be more creative: ""These urbanites complain about nature whilst I drive across the field every day and can see that the trees are still standing.) Basically the farmer's version of ""If global warming isn't happening then why was it cold outside."" This is by far my biggest gripe I have with them at the moment.  


TL; DR: The twitter thread leaves out a lot of in terms of the protest, which is already about a super complex issue which had been brewing for years. Rather than ""hurr durr vegans and hippies bad"", it's a combination of environmental sustainability, market mechanisms and failing government policy.",,/r/europe/comments/djqcg2/thread_about_the_recent_farmer_protests_in_the_nl/f47mppd/,TheBittersweetPotato,1571424672

2961,"&gt;There wouldn't be a Britain without the Romans or Germanic tribes.

Says who? Britain and Ireland weren't as advanced back then because the isles split off from the mainland around 6000 BCE. The Romans were one way we got into contact with the rest of Europe not the only one. As for the Germanics, their influence was cultural not genetic. We would've continued developing without them, we'd just follow some form of pre Anglo Saxon paganism and speak a different language. 

Also, the time scales are completely different. We're talking a difference of mere centuries, not thousands of years. 

&gt;Your attitude is exactly the reason your silly country is going to continue to diminish over the next century.

Don't fool yourself mate, the entirety of Europe will diminish over the next century. We're an aging continent led by a weak union that doesn't innovate to the level a region with as large a population as ours should.

2976,"Well laureates in chemistry and physics aren‚Äôt some schlubs, and they weren‚Äôt just nominated, as laureate means their accomplishments were deemed to be most distinguished in their entire fields. 

Given that chemistry is certainly a more rigorous and precise study than climatology, and that physics largely is as well, when these types of distinguished scientists point out flaws in methodology, it does carry weight. 

The fact that most of the early IPCC predictions weren‚Äôt too conservative, quite the opposite, and the resultant change in methodologies precisely because of these types of criticisms also indicate that they were largely well-founded. 

The fact that these models had to be discarded because of failing to be accurate, and the constant amelioration of methodologies shows a desire to at least adhere to sound science, but it doesn‚Äôt absolve the IPCC of pushing agenda-first inaccuracies. That scientists are now incorparating better methodologies in regard to specificity and minimizing extraneous influences around actual warming, doesn‚Äôt erase the fact that their initial predictions were doomsaying a reality that hasn‚Äôt materialized, and that this hysteria has become a foundational principle of the current climate change pathos. It‚Äôs is constantly inaccurate, at which time they amend their previous models to explain away why the net observational changes consistently fall well below their predictions. 


If the result of the last 150 years of industrialization has been a global change an order of magnitude lower than predicted, criticism of methodology and resultant predictive efficacy seems to be required more, not less. I simply use Nobel laureates‚Äô criticisms because their opinions should carry weight, as they have demonstrated to the world their ability for application of critical thought at the highest margin. 

And again, these criticisms aren‚Äôt welcomed like they are in most other scientific endeavors, placing climate change into a distinct category outside of typical science, where simple objections become harped on as heresy by its acolytes. Emissions are definitely rising, ice is definitely melting, and the temperature globally is changing...but never as much as predicted. The inferred devastation from those predictions is never quite observed. But the doomsaying has never rescinded in the last thirty years and the failed models are never acknowledged on that same scale. Greta is the current doomsayer for the next generation of, hopefully, ridiculously exaggerated predictions of catastrophe.",,/r/europe/comments/djj9x5/greta_thunbergs_13yearold_sister_is_struggling/f475uu7/,Godsms,1571417729

&gt;Ukraine ‚Äì a world-beating grain producer
&gt;
&gt;Arguably the best place in the world to grow grain crops, Ukraine‚Äôs potential to help feed the world is increasing all the time. 
&gt;
&gt;Around 70% of Ukraine‚Äôs land area of 603,000 square kilometres is devoted to agriculture, with more than 55% of land used for arable production. And it is not just any old arable land, but some of the finest in the world. Nearly 60% of its arable land is the much-prized ‚Äòblack soil‚Äô or Chernozem, that contains a high percentage of humus or broken-down plant-material (up to 15% in some cases) and essential plant nutrients such as phosphoric acid, phosphorous and ammonia.
&gt;
&gt;Pockets of this soil occur in a number of countries, but Ukraine is home to 30% of the world‚Äôs black soils, making it the ideal location to grow a large range of crops, including wheat, barley, corn, sugar beet, sunflower, soya beans and rapeseed. Dairy and meat production is also increasingly important.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernozem

That is not really true. You're right that the UK will make the first assessment on those points, but the EU can decide unilaterally if a product/good is at risk of living NI and entering the rest of the Single Market. At that point, that good must be taxed based on EU tariff, and the regulatory checks are still applied by the UK but based on the ECJ case law (ECJ interpretation of single market regulations). Meaning that unless the UK outright break the law,  outsourcing its custom border won't change anything for the EU. And if the UK decide to break the law, the EU can take that to the Joint Committee, which ultimately respond to the ECJ when it comes to interpreting EU law  (like whether or not a product respects EU single market regulation).",,/r/europe/comments/djkjsr/the_eu_is_preparing_to_delay_brexit_if_the_uk/f4623iz/,feox,1571402995

They say that *Turkish citizens* who live in Germany tend to vote AKP in Turkish elections (those who bother to vote). I don't like AKP, but they certainly aren't jihadist. Religious right wing conservatives, similar to PiS in Poland.

The other thing the articles say is that *German citizens* of Turkish decent tend to vote for SPD and Greens, so for the center left. Not far left.

Of course there is an overlap of dual citizens, but there are also lots of people who never got German citizenship, or who dropped Turkish citizenship.

There are several reasons for this. One is that conservative Turkish Germans tend to see themselves mainly as Turks, so they vote in Turkish elections. In Germany they don't have much choice because they can't identify with CDU due to the C, and they won't vote AfD because AfD is explicitly anti-Muslim.

Black and Hispanic unemployment is down and a lot of hispanic migrants also want a strong border given that so many came to the US legally and work hard for a living.

Having been a driver, then a traveling sales rep and now sometimes being delegated I cannot comprehend how is that law supposedly bad for folks like me.

Truck drivers: Polish and German companies service same routes. Polish company pays 3-6k and for the same route a western company pays you 10k+, the only difference is the latter require more experience, typically earned by doing 3 years of sucker gig at a polish company.  

As a sales rep, if I left base at 6, arrived for first meeting in Pozna≈Ñ by 10, and left the last one at 14:00, and then went to Szczecin (lets say we're there by 19:00) to start early the next day, I'd log 4h of work. My German colleague is logging 13h by this point.

As a delegated worker, I get fixed per diems as I travel. My German colleagues are logging the normal pay within hours + overtime from the start of the trip to its end + additional OT if they stay in offices after 8h.

The conclusion of the article, pasted above and translated bellow, are directly confirming what I say and contradicting what you're saying.

&gt;Beyond the figures, we were able to confirm the variety of profiles involved in the movement during our survey. The name of the creator of the ""yellow vest"" groups was visible in 140 of the 226 cases we studied, or 61% of the groups, including the ten largest in the movement, all of which have more than 25,000 members. Of these 140 groups, only two were created by the same person. Similarly, most groups have at least three or four different administrators.

&gt;All these observations do not dispel all the mysteries surrounding the emergence of the ""yellow vest"" movement. But they show that beyond the fantasies, concrete elements explain in large part how it has taken on such a dimension in such a short period of time.

This quote is directly from the NATO page you cite, detailing that there would not be additional combat troops stationed. There is a similar provision in the [2+4 Treaty](https://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/2plusfour8994e.htm), that prohibits non-German troops in East Germany:

Not above everything else. Parents also have to support kids in their growth to be part of the society and responsible adults. This means that parents shouldn't always protect kids, but also give opportunities for kids to protect themselves.

If a parent locks their kids into basement in order to protect them, that's child abuse.

&gt;If my kid's ambition is to expose himself to the world, be it for a good cause, then it's my duty to stop him.

So if your kid is is becoming a world class athlete, you stop them from doing sports.

If your kid is is a talented writer and publishers want their book to be pulbished globally, you prevent this?

If your kid wants to talk about the rights of children at an UN confrence, you want to stop them?

I get that you don't care about this and that's fine. But I genuinely do for better reasons than that you don't. *Because this sort of stuff actually matters in diplomacy.*

The statement wasn't corrupt, wasn't illegal. But it was incompetent and stupid. And I've more explained why.

Nowhere did I claim that he doesn't understand that the US didn't exist thousands of years ago. My point has consistently been about the incompetency of the statement.

Diplomacy requires precise wording. This is a fucking mess. He literally is claiming that they're part of a shared history and legacy. That is not only multi interpretable, but the primary meaning would be that the US is directly linked to the Roman empire. It simply isn't.

Can people get it from context?

Yes. But that is still stupid and fucking sloppy in prepared diplomatic remarks. Change 2 words and you would have had a precise statement. Now you have idiots like you going ""when taken the other way it's fine"". Not understanding that for me the stupidity was that it allowed for the confusion in the first place.

You simply aren't supposed to have statements with a ""fine"" and ""stupid"" interpretation. 

If a lawyer consistently wrote an important contract where such double interpretation was possible they'd get shit canned straight away. The lack of care is what counts here.

Since that same lack of care is what in actually important situations will cause pain and suffering to thousands to millions.

As for a political solution, the first step would be for Junqueras and all the separatists to come back to planet Earth and face reality: under the Spanish Constitution a referendum of independence like he wants is not possible unless it happens in the context of a Constitutional reform. The Constitutional court has made that very clear, so there is no way that any Spanish government would grant what Junqueras wants, and if they did, they would fall the next day, and probably face legal consequences themselves.

3402,"These concerns are valid, but they should have been addressed \*before\* the referendum and not afterwards.  The reasoning you are using is the same that the Founding Fathers ended up going with in the U.S. when setting up the voting system for President and the structure of Congress.  We don't need to discuss the American political system here, but I mention it, because I agree that regional votes should be considered at some level and not just the total votes; some very important people in history agreed with us as well.

All that said though: the time to argue the point was before the referendum.  Once the votes were cast, it's too late to call for a do-over or to argue that each region should get a shot now.  

As to how binding it is: well, I guess that is ultimately a variant of a Varys riddle; it's as binding as people think it is.  Maybe you can convince enough people that it should not be binding.  However, we've had 2 PMs have their political careers ended over this and the Parliament has treated it as binding for too long for you to have much chance to change the effecting binding power of the referendum.  Also, I'm not an expert in British Parlipro, and I know that a long and wide tradition weighs heavily on how Parliament conducts its business.  Perhaps an expert on these matters could weigh in on whether Parliament \*could\* just ignore the referendum, or if some precendent from 1732 (or whenever) effectively binds them anyway.",,/r/europe/comments/dj408m/boris_johnson_says_he_has_secured_great_new_deal/f45kpse/,bremidon,1571381407

You don't get what we are talking about. In 56 the governmental power collapsed, so democratic institutions like worker councils could be created. You act like that is why people died in the streets not because the fucking USSR invaded.

3601,"*skims [whitepaper](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ESET_Operation_Ghost_Dukes.pdf)*

&gt; The group‚Äôs main initial tactic to breach a network is to send spearphishing emails that contain a link  
or an attachment...When targets click on these malicious links or attachments, a .zip archive that contains a malicious, macro-enabled Word document and a decoy (as shown in Figure 3) will be downloaded.  If victims then open the malicious document and enable the macro, it will then install the PowerDuke backdoor [14].  

That's one of the fundamental problems with desktop computer security today.

You've got a wide range of users, who cannot reasonably be expected to diagnose whether-or-not any given link or attachment is risky, who have the ability to grant control over their system to the outside world.

I'm not an expert in phone OS security, but from what I've seen, it's closer to having the ability to isolate malicious apps.

As long as that issue is present, the rest of computer security is details.

&gt; However, this is not the only method used by the Dukes to gain initial access.   In 2014, the Dukes started 
using two mass-spreading methods to deliver the OnionDuke implant:
&gt;
&gt; ‚Ä¢ Trojanized pirated applications downloaded via BitTorrent

Same issue as above.

&gt; ‚Ä¢ A malicious TOR exit node to trojanize downloaded applications on the fly 

I suppose that that could theoretically be fixed by patching Tor to disallow non-https http traffic, since I assume that that's the mechanism that they're relying on.  At one point in time, that would have been a prohibitive restriction, but one of the few ways that computer security has honest-to-God improved is in moving Internet connectivity to be encrypted.

&gt; Figure 9 shows the distribution of the operational hours of the Dukes in the three different time zones. The 
distribution aligns well with working hours in a UTC+2 or UTC+3 time zone, with occasional work during the 
night. This might be explained by a need to work at the same time as some of their victims.

Well, that'd be [Europe or thereabouts](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/).

[Cape Wrath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Wrath)

&gt; Its exposed northerly position can give rise to some exceptionally low winter sunshine levels: in January 1983 it recorded just 38 minutes of sunshine, a record low for Scotland.

Countries have satellite coverage of most of the world now.  Yeah, okay, if you're desperate you can hide some activity indoors or underground, but naval activities are kinda stuck being in plain view.  A country with a satellite knows how fast a ship can move and how it's interacting with other ships and whatnot.

I've commented before on the fact that that's a limiting factor in trying to evade the eyes of satellites, since ships are unlikely to be able to choose to be under clouds in war.

But...I suppose that it might be okay for doing exercises.  Like, one has a fair degree of freedom in choosing where to do exercises, and the [North Atlantic has one of the highest rates of average cloud cover in the world](http://eclipsophile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Annual-Aqua-PM-globe.png).

3662,"&gt;As long as they stay out of our borders and stop terrorist attacks on our civilians we are fine

Yeah no. They aren't committing terrorist attacks on your civilians, nobody believes that bullshit. Secondly it's Turkey invading them so it's YOU who is on their borders and now into their region attacking them. All is definitely not fine.

&gt;It was not our idea to fuck up Iraq and Syria

Actually Turkey did and has been fucking up Syria for 8 straight years. Pretty much ALL foreign ISIS fighters came from Turkey. Istanbul to the Syrian border. All of them caught have Turkey stamps. Secondly the rebels are pretty much propped up by Turkey. Turkey is the only sponsor now that keeps them together. How ironic that your country is the biggest sponsor of terrorism in Syria and you are here using that to attack and bomb civilians.

&gt;we cant just allow Americans to dump their weapons on terrorist groups left and right then leave the country like nothing happened.

The Kurds aren't terrorists. It's Turkey who are terrorists.

&gt;We are stuck with them years to come if we dont do anything now.

Actually this line is the only line I don't personally blame you and think it's the core reason why you are like this. You have been tricked into thinking Kurds will attack you or something. This is the lie that has lead to many Turks supporting this war.

The years of propaganda in Turkey to convince you they will attack and such is why you people are like this. If you can overcome this, you can reverse this downhill for Turkey. Since Kobani you supported ISIS over the PKK. You put them as enemies, not the other way around. This might be tough for you, but if you do your research, you will see that Syrian Kurds want peace. Possibly the Americans are just laying the seeds of war for Turkey - I'm not sure.

https://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/figures/internet-tables-all.xls

For 2018, in line 99 you see how much money the UK contributed to the EU budget. This includes the import duties, which is often not seen as a real national contribution, but in this comparison I think it is fair that it is included, because this revenue from the UK would stop after Brexit, and it is still uncertain if it will be replaced by import duty revenue from goods going from the UK to the EU (in case of a big free trade agreement, it probably would be a lot less).

In line 84 you see how much the UK got from the EU budget. So for 2018 the figures are: paid 16.4 billion. Received: 6.6 billion. Net payment 9.8 billion. It is a bit lower the last few years because there have been many delays in EU expenditure, which lowered everyone's contribution. But for example in 2015 it was: paid 21.4 billion.

3700,"Please stop. You‚Äôre embarrassing yourself. When you go to the supermarket you pay in pounds. It doesn‚Äôt matter to you if a pound is now 15% less compared to the dollar than it was before. It is only relevant for imports.

The US economy in 2008 fell by [around 4%](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth-annual). That 4% fall was the biggest since the Great Depression in 1928-1929. A 4% fall in GDP year over year is absolutely devastating. You seem to have 0 knowledge of economics. A 20% fall in GDP per year is something that is unthinkable, even WW2 did not cause such a fall. 

In your example the factory owners mostly wouldn‚Äôt care apart from imports, all domestic production and prices would be the same, the exchange rate is irrelevant for the vast majority of things. Even more importantly, a devalued currency makes those products cheaper for the foreign markets, increasing exports even more. As long as the exchange rate changes aren‚Äôt totally out of control and repeating constantly, a limited (even big) shock will have almost 0 consequences for purchasing power, as seen in 2016 in the UK.

Economists do not unanimously say that the Euro was a terrible idea. Some criticise it because its institutional framework is still incomplete (a supranational fiscal budget would be preferable) but even in that case there are studies done on the US that show that a fiscal budget as large as the US one can still only reduce asymmetric shocks to the economies of the various states by less than 20%, around 14% in fact. A crisis that is 14% smaller is still a crisis, the difference is minimal. That‚Äôs the only criticism from respected economists, with a mention of labor mobility a second one sometimes mentioned (labor mobility between countries in the EU is still smaller than labor mobility between States in the US, but it is increasing).

3711,"When Dutch economy was at the same level of development as Polish economy today, Dutch companies had to deal with 0% emissions policy? You are speaking about unfair advantage? Let¬¥s me tell you one thing, when you as a country has no capital at all and you compete with countries that are accumulating capital since more than a century, we go back to colonial times, what the hell unfair advantage you talking me about? For example 70% of polish banking sector is in foreign hand. And you are talking about unfair advantage. Do you know that all major industrial powers - USA, GB, Japan, and so on - at start had high customs duties policy to protect their new industries to became competitive? All they became pro free market after their industries/capital become strong, not before (Im not saying its the way to Poland, for that you need colonies).

In the background this is very simple, the only way undevelopement economies as Polish can grow today, is being cheaper to companies. Because the other way, being innovative, requires huge capital. Just like that. You know the difference between Dutch and Polish economy. Dutch produce high value-added goods. Polish it is mostly outsourcing of German or French industry, normally intermediate products. And you saying Dutch and Polish economy can hold 0% emissions the same way? What Dutch people say when they say ""We will simply make companies leave if we implement this"", is we don¬¥t want to Poland, Czech, and so on, reach our standard of living. Because that would mean lose our competitive advantage and less unfair advantage. In the end you see us Eastern Europeans as cheap manpower if necessary, and market for your¬¥s companies products that we will not be able to produce ourself because we have been late to the party and now no one will allow us to do this what you did earlier, protect your incipient industry. But the funniest thing of all is that although you force Poland to self-assimilate its competitiveness, these companies will not return to your countries. They go to Turkey, Ukraine, or further, and from there they will sell their products themselves.

If everyone would adopt the 0% emissions policy as you say, I would be fervently in favor. First because then the fight would make sense, and second because no country would be deceived. But it won't be like that. You have to be naive to think that a climate catastrophe perspective does not change the Chinese policy, but the European sacrifice will. Really? In real life what will happen, as only Europe will do at this scale, 10% of emissions, climate change will come the same. Europe will severely damage its competitiveness, but the richest countries will reward it a bit with its new energy markets - Eastern countries. And the countries of the east ... will finish growing + 4% and will stagnate with 0-2%. Perfect colonies... sorry, markets.

Sanctions? Jaja, good joke. But who is going to put the sanctions, if many of these companies that pollute in these countries are YOURS companies? I certainly dont¬¥s see Dutch Prime Minister threating China. They are going to threaten to close his market of 1.4 billion people for your companies, and you are going to ask for forgiveness. This is how this damn world works. I repeat, Europe does not have enough oil or gas, I think it is better to develop these technologies and produce the energy ourselves rather than finance Russian expansionism, or regimes of doubtful morality like Saudi Arabia.

A ""Catalan that hates everything about the Spanish language"". To me someone like that is a retard, beast or whatever you want to call it. I wouldn't use those expressions in a public article, tho. But they deserve to be criticized.

Bear in mind Torra in that text talks about people who show ""An outraged hatred, nauseating, against everything that the Catalan represents"". That's the kind of people he's calling beasts. Think about the people who want to see Catalan language disappear. Not someone who wants to speak Spanish.

And definitely not the Spanish people, when Spaniards aren't even mentioned at all. Despite what some parties have said. This article must be one of the articles that has been more manipulated:

3871,"The Government doesn‚Äôt have control over the exchange rate in any modern country thankfully. Central Banks are independent, and for good reason. A flexible currency at most prevents the economy from reacting right away to economic shocks (the currency appreciates or devalues, giving time to the real economy to adjust to the new economic reality). It‚Äôs the opposite of what you‚Äôre saying.

If the weak Euro is good for Germany, then why did you mention that the Euro and the EU hid the economic problems for years, and then gave as an example Germany being close to recession to prove that point in your last comment? Haven‚Äôt you noticed that you‚Äôre contradicting yourself? Is the weak Euro beneficial to Germany or did the weak Euro and the EU hide the economic problems which is why Germany is close to recession now? Those two points are contradictory.

While the Euro Area includes some less developed countries, the vast vast majority of GDP of the Euro Area comes from countries economically developed very close to the UK level. The UK has had lower GDP growth than the Euro Area in 2 of the last 4 years (2017-2018), higher GDP growth in one (in 2016 UK:1,9%, EA:1,8%) and it will probably have lower or on par growth in 2019. That is not a country doing better.

Your GDP comparisons are made using the values in dollars, without adjusting for the exchange rate, which makes no sense. Germany has performed better than all the others mentioned (almost +15%), since 2008, that‚Äôs true, and Greece and Italy still have lower GDP than in 2008, but not by anywhere the numbers you mentioned. Spain instead has already surpassed its 2008 peak, its GDP is at record levels (+12%), and the UK too (+13%). The Euro Area as a whole too (+11%). There‚Äôs almost no difference there (consider that without Italy and to a lesser extent Greece dragging the average down, the Euro Area would practically have the same or better growth rate than the UK since 2008). And as I already mentioned, when you look at other things, like productivity or wage growth, the UK did worse than all but Greece.

Your last statement makes no sense at all. The higher the unemployment, the higher the potential GDP growth (because there‚Äôs a greater possibility of new people joining the jobs market). That doesn‚Äôt mean they will have higher GDP growth (those jobless people do have to find jobs after all), but the possibility is there.

3882,"Here it is ! I nailed the original sin :

&gt;Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union: EU energy policy is aimed at promoting the development of new and renewable forms of energy to better align and integrate climate change goals into the new market design.

Negotiations toward the 2007 signing of the Treaty of Lisbon were so intense that this mistake did not receive much attention. What I pinpoint here is the confusion  between 

&gt;new and renewable forms of energy

on one hand, and

&gt;climate change goals

on the other.

Don't get me wrong. Renewable is good. Sustainable is good. Since the 1972 publication of *The Limit to Growth* we know  (but often forget) that natural resources are limited and that our techno-industrial societies pile up unforgivable debts. As a civililsation, it is indeed quite a sound idea to envision a future where *everything* is sustainable. Renewable energy, renewable raw materials, renewable food.

Although the *climate* is not immediately understood as a *natural resource*, it shall be remembered that one paramount resource bestowed by Mother Earth upon Humanity is its ability to absorb, disolve and recycle the wastes that our industry produces. So, in the long march toward sustainability, it appears, in a manner now all too flagrant, that the most urgent step is to stop pumping carbon dioxyde into the atmosphere. This, as of now, is known by all.

In the sentence I quote above, there is this first confusion between *renewable* and *low carbon*. The second confusion isn't apparent here, but is often derived : the confusion between *energy* and *electricity*.

And that's how we arrive at the *[Directive 2009/28/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2009/28/oj) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC* and its various transcriptions into national laws.

This directive now lives an uneasy cohabitation with the various dispositions taken since the inception the EEC that tend to consider electricity as just another industrial product that shall be unleashed on the competitive market like any other industrial commodity (more on this at bottom). So, we have this free market, which is good, regulated, because climate, by a tilt toward ~~low carbon~~ renewables ~~energy~~ electricity, which ~~is~~ could also appear good.

I don't know what the situation currently is in the 27+1 countries of the Union, but below I try to give a quick overview of what I think I understand of the absurdities those contradictions have led to in France.

Here, for decades, electricity has been decarbonated thanks to *(gasp)* nuclear with a little help from hydro. The fleet of nuclear reactors being partialy amortized, the consumer's bill is very reasonable.

This Directive 2009/28/EC was implemented here focusing only on electricity. As renewables, in the begining, struggled quite a bit. To prop them up a bit, a seemingly virtuous measure passed into law : producers of renewabe electricity could now sell their ware *at a fix price* (105‚Ç¨) well above the market price (fluctuating but around ~ 50 ‚Ç¨) and with priority above everything else. This inflated price is financed by a tax levied on everyone's bill, and now France routinely subsidies windmills to the tune of *3 billions ‚Ç¨* each year. On the carbon account, the benefit is Schwatze-Null, or even minus-something since manufacturing all those clean turbines comes of course with a carbon tag. With this kind of money invested in the last ten years, we could have completely decarbonated all of Poland's electricity.

Of course, those monies were not lost on every one. One of the biggest operator of renewables in France is now Total (big oil), another one is Engie (big gas). Paid to greenwash.

And this, kids, is how a seemingly innocuous phrase in a treaty can trigger a cascade of legislative failures and end up in the opposite of the intended direction.

-----------------------------------------------------

On electricity as your usual market comodity : it is not, here is why.

1/ It is the only merchandise in the world where the supply must exactly follow the demand, at all time. Imperative absolute just-in-time, now stocks allowed, no hoarding permitted. There are technical and scientific reasons behind this, but also historical and societal reasons. Our techno-industrial societies are entirely organized around the fact that electricity is available on demand.

2/ The grid. The distribution network is unique and constrained. A supplier is never at liberty to choose its delivery route, there is no competing carrier. However how highly you regard the liberalization of all commerce, you cannot escape this anti-concurrential bottleneck.

3/ It is a public service. Of course, it is always possible to make arrangements to provide a modicum of cheap light to the needy. It is also a public service on the scale of continental infrastructure. Europe cannot have a prosperous industry without a reliable supply of electricity. We stach maybe three month of strategic reserves of petroleum. We do have reserves of electricity stored behind our mountain dams,and renewable too, but clearly not enough to power all of Europe.

4/ Its importance can only increase dramatically while we creep toward carbon neutrality. Think of all those cars and trucks, all those heaters that *will* be electrified. Besides, all those carbon-capture factories that we are promised, and indeed need dearly, will consume a lot of energy that can only come from decarbonized electricity. Electrifying all the things is a duty to the world and to the future.

actually the founders of the nation modelled Washington around French Neoclassicism. The ideas of the newly born USA were inspired by French enlightenment (Jefferson, Franklin, etc had spent significant amount of time in Paris). The plan for Washington DC were actually drawn by a French architect and largely draw from the Baroque era garden design of people like Andre Le Notre and French architects who further developed the Italian idea of the Ideal city. 

You can find similar urban planning designs for cities like London (failed city planning after the 1666 fire of London), St Petersburg, etc.

The main problem is that elections/politics is one huge popularity contest.  You don't personally know the people your voting for, most people don't even know the policies of the party they represent - and they're not really accountable to you.  
Removing the votes from people who aren't ""intelligent"" or ""credible"", will only cause other problems.  
To me there's one solution (which'll never happen).  Have every 100-150 people (voters) choose one person to represent them that **they know**.  That can actually be accountable to them.  
Get 100-150 of these personal representatives meet together regularly and get to know one another and discuss &amp; vote on policies that affect their district (approx 15,000 people, a large village / small town).  These people then elect one person (that they know &amp; trust) from their district as their representative.  
Get 100-150 of these 'district' representatives to meet regularly, discuss &amp; vote on policies etc that affect their region (\~2 million people - so a city, county, whatever).  They elect one representative (that they know &amp; trust) to represent them on a national stage.  
You'd have 100-150 people to represent the nation &amp; decide on national politics. (US in this case, 250 million voters - I'm actually from the UK).  Each person is very much accountable to the people below them.

4041,"Being from Northern Ireland and growing up here I have first hand experience of why the Northern Ireland situation is so tricky. It cannot be taken in isolation it's to do with a violent past and the EU have been a crucial part in creating the delicate peace that now exists between the nationalist (mostly Catholic) and unionist (most protestant) sides.

The Good Friday Agreement for example is a EU peace treaty. It formed the basis of the current peace greement along with a number of others. It was this combined with the EUs single market that allowed people and goods to travel totally freely between Ireland, The UK and the rest of the EU.

The problem now is that as a region, Northern Ireland voted by 67% to remain so we are being dragged out against our will. Brexit on its own is an unbelievably complex process on its own so I will keep this to NI specifically. The problem is that because they prop up the minority conservative government in Westminster, the DUP have a completely disproportionate amount of influence compared to the level of support they have across the whole of the UK.

As strong Unionist they would oppose anything which see NI treated in any way different from the rest of the UK. With the UK leaving the EU, Ireland's border with Northern Ireland then becomes a problem. The best option would be keep NI both in the UK market and the EU single market as part of a bespoke solution but the DUP would never allow this. As well as this, the EU would want guarantees that goods within their ""single market"" would adhere to certain health standards and thus border checks would be necessary between NI and Ireland.

The problem with border checks is that they would definitely become a vulnerable target for sectarian paramilitaries, increase violence in border sorrounding areas and take us 30 years in the past.

&gt;No i'm not, what are you on about? When did i cover that? The deposing of the government started by the Greek junta. The motive and the goal was Enosis (the union) because 80% of the island was inhabited by Greeks and the vast majority wanted to be united with Greece. Hardly an unreasonable desire but the means of course were wrong and disastrous. I have never defended that. Killings happened by both sides however. The TMT had its fair share of killing civilians etc. Both sides were pitted against each other (largely by the British). 

So basically what you had, an independent Cyprus free of settlers, occupiers etc wasn't good enough, you gambled lost and now you're the victim. 


&gt;The deposing happened and it was wrong obviously. Turkey invaded, people died (more people on the Greek Cypriot side, than the Turkish Cypriots that had died during the massacres) and the Junta fell (thanks for that btw, no sarcasm). However what Turkey did is just as wrong if not worse. You're occupying another country for 45 years and you're holding the island a hostage with your armed forces with the pretense of protecting the TCypriots from that happening again which is a joke. 

It's a joke to you. It's not a joke to us. And your attitude of just leave and everything will be fine shows it. Let's say Turkey withdrew. Cyprus demands North Cyprus dissolve. They refuse. What then? You're gonna ask nicer or use your army to get what you want? 

&gt;By ""you"" i'm assuming you mean the Greek Cypriots, not Greece. They're different things. I explained above why it happened. Both Greece and Cyprus (or its vast majority) wanted to be united. The thing is that military Junta tried to force that. Of course it wasn't good or right. I'm not saying there was a good reason for that.

But it happened. And there's zero reason to expect better behavior this time around. Because all the Greek Cypriots talk about about how they were done wrong never about what they did. 

&gt;I'm not talking about 1974 though. The 1974 deal ended with Turkey's intervention and the Junta being toppled.  Yes there were 0 settlers in 1974. But then after the violence had ceased there were settlers. To what end? To solidify Turkey's occupation of the island. That was my point, Turkey did exactly what it blamed Greece for trying to do.

But here you pretend that settlers and Turkey are the reason there's no settlement. In 1974 there was no settler and no army and yet you guys still weren't satisfied. 

&gt;I don't think you know what minority means. Minority doesn't equal less rights. Even before 1974 the Turkish Cypriots were a minority cause they were 20% of the population. 

I know perfectly what it means. The community had equal status in 1974. You didn't want to give it then and you don't want to now. Instead you say that individuals would be equal before the law, which is meaningless because the Greek side would have all legal power. 

&gt;You want the island to be 50% Turkish Cypriots i'm assuming. Why? How do you justify that? 

Not really. If I were allowed to dream I actually think an ideal situation would be to permanently partition the island on a permanent basis. Cyprus would get ~80% and the Turkish Cypriots the rest. Because a unified Greek state with a Turkish minority, which is the South's solution isn't acceptable to the Turkish side. 
Barring that the Greek side has to suck it up and go back to 1974 status. 


&gt;That's the thing, it doesn't matter. Territory is territory regardless of whether people live there or not. We might choose to inhabit them, we might not. It doesn't matter and it's none of Turkey's business. I don't think that borders only apply when the islands are habitable. Yes, Turkey can't move its fleet in between our islands without permission from Greece. just like Greece can't move its fleet through the straights to have access to the Black Sea without permission from Turkey. Turkey has access to the southern Mediterranean from its southern part, and other than that, turkish (non military) vessels can still pass through the Aegean according to the law of innocent passage. So yes, fleets are restricted when passing in between other country's land masses like islands. Who would have known?? 

Again, Greece wants to apply new laws and regulations to an area that whose borders were determined under different rules. Turkey doesn't have to accept it. Especially not since Turkey didn't ratify UNCLOS. 

&gt;I just explained to you that ""it's my interest"" doesn't equal ""it's reasonable"". It's in our iterest to have Gibraltar. Is it reasonable? No. Turkey asking for control in a sea in which it has almost 0 territory is indeed unreasonable. Greece wanting to extend its borders as per international (and customary) law *is* reasonble and that's why the law has customary status, cause all countries find it to be reasonable and that's also why all these countries support Greece in this. Literally you're the only ones saying your request is reasonable. You're not owed access in a sea in which Greece has territory all over the place.

It's perfectly reasonable when Greece wants to use new laws to shut Turkey out of the Mediterranean.",,/r/europe/comments/dgv7wh/germany_bans_exports_of_arms_to_turkey/f437836/,kapsama,1571339151

I would have hired a PI on day 1, he has been gone for over 2 weeks and every day that passes and they do not hear from him the chances of him being found dwindle by leaps and bounds. Maybe he is in touch with his parents and not his wife? Maybe his family has hired a PI in Paris and they just are not talking about it? I  hope they are not expecting him to miraculously show back up, call or reappear. As an investigator and what little I know of this case, the chances of that miracle are slim without someone working this case in Paris and maybe by now, even beyond there. The Police in Paris are not going to utilize the resources required to search to try to find an American that flew there to disappear and if anyone tells them they will, they are misguiding them. I know it will take money and I am almost certain his young wife is more worried about feeding and providing for her child than hiring a PI and likely does not have the means to fund this but his parents, siblings or other stable people in his life may. If they have not hired an investigator in Paris, I hope they do so, and quickly, otherwise their most recent goodbye may have been the last.",,/r/europe/comments/dhwacf/missing_bloke_from_san_diego_california_last_seen/f43882q/,Smileypeach,1571339441

4105,"&gt; Dude what are you on exactly?

&gt; The US europes bitch? It has been the other way round for the last 80 years boy. It wasnt't the UK and France that dragged the US into...

WWI? WWII? Vietnam?

Umm... yes it was!

It wasn‚Äôt the Europeans who conspired to fund a Mexican invasion of our territory? It wasn‚Äôt European submarines that sank our civilian merchant vessels? It wasn‚Äôt the Europeans who gave assurances to the Japanese when they were planning a surprise attack on our civilians? It wasn‚Äôt the Europeans who begged the US for help in Vietnam and then bailed on us as soon as we got there?

Are you fucking kidding me?

All of our major wars have been a result of European fucks dragging us into their fantasies of world domination and dreams of empires lasting a thousand years... You pulled us into shit like Vietnam when you were about to lose it as a colonial territory, and then bailed on us like fucking rats...

&gt; And it also wasn't the european nations that bombed the shit out of afghanistan but they still had to be part of the ISAF and also pay billions for actions of the US.

Yeah you‚Äôre right. We invoked Article 5 of NATO after 9-11-2001. And you guys didn‚Äôt bomb shit. You didn‚Äôt do anything worthwhile. You proved that we don‚Äôt need you...

&gt; The only thing that changes is that those afghan farmers don't get hit by a rocket costing more than all of them would earn in a lifetime fired from a drone costing a tenth of afghanistans GDP.

Yeah, kind of like that WTC janitor who was scrubbing a pisser as a couple of planes flew into the building he was in... If you don‚Äôt want uncle Sam‚Äôs dick, then don‚Äôt carry out an attack on our soil targeting our civilians...

It doesn‚Äôt surprise me that, regarding the Global War on Terror, Europe puts the blame squarely on the US. It just reinforces how you are the enemy and how we need to decouple from you ASAP!

&gt; Oh and the quick reality check: Basically every sane person in the US also thinks of the UK leaving the EU as a bad idea and the current plan for dealing with the UK afterwards is basically turning it into an american outpost on the European border and bleeding it out so much it is dependant on the US.

Just like the other side of a coin, similarly, calls for recognition of this intentional destruction have existed similarly since day 1 all the way until today. Specifically with regards to the term *genocide* since it was invented in the 1940s and became known in the 50s, there have been calls for *genocide* recognition via street protests, protests in front of Turkish embassies all over the world where Armenians lived since the 60's all the way until today. 

The fall of the Soviet Union just changed the realpolitik calculus of the west which always unconditionally backed Turkey in its suppression and denial of the genocide because of Turkey being a key Cold War ally of the west, on the one hand, and on another, Armenia became an independent state, so recognition didn't imply favouring the enemy of the west, Russia, and of course Communism was gone by then as well. It has nothing to do with the Karabakh War. The Turkish relations with Armenia are also related to the Karabakh War, and not only defined by the genocide, but that is another issue. 

It's not that Turkish perpetrators weren't tried. It's that the state has been denying all of this and exports said denial. If tomorrow Turkey comes clean and instead of denying or justifying the genocide says ""look, we had trials, this was messed up, the state wronged""... even without using the term *genocide*, that would be a gigantic positive step.",,/r/europe/comments/diq7lu/turks_dislike_these_countries_groups/f42ghqy/,Idontknowmuch,1571331429

Entire production chains depend on the stability of prices across the continent. You wouldn't make deals with a country where solvency due to currency issues is questionable. What I do agree with you on is the fact that the European economy is a bit of a halfway house between national policies and a full financial union. Enforcement of rules and unifying fiscal policy would get rid of further sources of instability. I wouldn't say that it's a misguided one-size-fits-all approach though.

4300,"My theory is that everyone would prefer to be able to plausibly blame some 'other' whilst they are standing in an economic shambles, instead of owning up to their own mistakes.

Labour insisting on a referendum that has only two choices (""Cancel A50"" or ""Accept this specific deal, in full"") is insisting on something that is sufficiently easily defended that, if the conservatives obstruct the with-referendum-attached deal, labour gets to point fingers at the conservatives and shrug.

Similarly, having made plenty of consessions and getting the in that sense 'third party' of the EU to sign off on the deal being at least plausibly workable, refusal by labour to just pass it means the conservatives get to shrug and point fingers, too.


Then again, perhaps my theory is just straight up a falsehood: It would predict that BoJo would stonewall the EU to then turn around and be able to point at the EU as well as those who did not want to fully embrace hard brexit instead of taking responsibility, and, well, that did not happen.

4337,"&gt; Nuclear has pretty much the same problem: it needs backup. Last winter here in Belgium, 6 out of 7 nuclear plants were down, just when they were supposed to have their major reliability advantage over renewables. You still need backup, also if you have nuclear.

That seems like it was a fluke? France has lots of nuclear energy, and would not be able to work if 85% of their nuclear energy sometimes went out of service.

So it seems like Belgium has 2 nuclear plants. It happened that one was most down for planned repairs, while the other mostly went down for unscheduled repairs. Obviously, if you have only 2 nuclear plants, the chance of both going down at the same time by accident is quite high. This basic math is true for all power plants... 

The obvious and easy solution is to built more than 2 plants, and having a power grid which can transport the electricity to where it is needed. Also to have cables and deals with your EU neighbours, so they can help you if you are stupid enough to only have 2 plants, and they are both out of action by chance.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/dj4dfg/why_france_is_eyeing_nuclear_power_again/f41amwa/,Thue,1571316911

The whole point of a parliamentary democracy is to try and avoid rash, irresponsible, idiotic decisions on complex issues. That's why referenda are rarely a good idea, and have to be very very carefully, explicitly and clearly set out and the population sufficiently educated and informed to vote on it. The 2016 referendum was none of these and the population likewise not ready for it so it was a disaster from the word go and continues to be to this day. 

There is a strong case for a charge of wilful negligence to be brought against the government which set it up, and subsequent governments ""honouring"" the incredibly slim margin of victory for one side despite foreign interference, lies and illegal campaigning. It wasn't even binding FFS, but just advisory. The only possible legitimacy it could have is in setting up a second referendum where the actual terms of possible options are set out clearly and ambiguously with a national educational campaign to clarify and inform. We might still get a second referendum and you could take the last three years as an educational experience of a sort, so it might still happen but Christ if isn't on a knife edge right now.

To have got to the point in three short years where ""yeah, collective suicide is a fair option"" is not just an acceptable view point but even quite popular is a fucking tragedy. Even I'm fucking sick of it and I understand and care more about it than most.

So in short could we theoretically have a vote to split the country? Sure but I'll vote too.

Regarding Catalan separatism those who support it are not even the majority. Puigdemont infamously tried a UDI with 48% of votes. So that ain't an argument either.

As for the ""reasons"" they don't have a single solid reason, unless you go full crazy revisionism and think that every spanish civil war was a war of ""spaniards"" against ""catalan"", we've always been the same bunch for more than a millennium,we fought against the moors, we colonized America, we got into endless wars with France and the Brits... etc for fuck's sake the first Spanish president during the first republic days was a Catalan. 

The big reason was money, Catalonia is one of the most prosperous regions in Spain and during the 2008 crash the Catalan government found Spain to be the perfect scapegoat (using education and TV which they control both) constantly lying saying that we were thieves, that they were superior... around those days separatism barely reached 14% and were considered a bunch of weirdos.

4409,"Well you need to go back to 1980 to analyse that. It would take forever to explain this and actually very intelligent and educated people wrote books about this, universities are giving lectures dedicated to this so my take might look very basic.

Up to 1980, Turkey had leftist and rightist literally having a guerrilla warfare everywhere. Bombings, shootings, protests etc was very common. Rightist included religious extremists to some degree but they were quite small representation the grand scheme of things (most famous today is Fettullah Gulen who first appeared in public with Anti-Communist Association ([terrible translation of this](https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kom%C3%BCnizmle_M%C3%BCcadele_Derne%C4%9Fi) in 60s) . September 12 1980, Turkey had a coup by the military. Military destroyed, killed, tortured, exiled, literally destroyed any kind of political spectrum.  Leftist, rightist, nationalist, social democrats. All suffered greatly. (events, cause and effect of these can go for pages)  


In order to facilitate their dominance, they establish so called Kemalizm. Which is in practice converted following Ataturk ideals (for fucks sake guy said if my opinions and science contradicts, always choose science. He was against any kind of blind faith.) to worshiping Ataturk without context. Religious groups suffered the least from this coup because they were lets say not active too much. 

Later policies of pushing religious groups of people to their limits (head scarf banning policies, active military espionage groups marking religious people and preventing them from becoming high level influences etc.) combined with terrible times terrible post coup economic, social and municipal management by politicians from 80s to mid 90s, made people more interested about this proto-AKP parties (Refah). Which was shut down due to religious abuse etc. etc etc.

Then comes AKP and Erdogan with very successful municipal background, jailed for reading a poem, saying we changed, we left the train of fundamentalism etc. Pro Eu, pro open market etc. And last 18 years happen. (First election due to stupid system AKP got 30% of votes but gained 60% of presentation in the Parliament)

Basically if I push you enough, I can make you a super hardcore too and that happened in masses in Turkey.

&amp;#x200B;

Again Imamoglu, current mayor of Istanbul won a legendary landslide victory (twice) against AKP due to same reason. He welcomed everybody. He used a policy of not aggression but understanding, respect and tolerance for everyone plus a very solid stance on corruption (Istanbul has a budget of 6.2 billion EUR that was obviously not used fairly or legally since Erdogan times).

4506,"The solubility of bone depends in part on how much Calcium there is in the sourunding soil. 
Basically if there's enough calcium, the bones will fossilize.

However it's not a general fertile = slow, because peat bogs for example are one of the worst soils, and extremely nutrient poor.

However their acidity and presence of tannins causes corpses to mummify (or rather turns their skin into leather) and stay around for thousands of years. while the actual bone does dissolve slightly, due to the peat typically being poor in Calcium, as well as acidic environments being better at dissolving Calciumphosphates.

But since bones aren't only Calciumpgosphate but rather have a network of living tissue in them, this tissue gets tanned as well, and thus preserved.


Basically you can have remains that are fossilised and everything in the bone is replaced by minerals, or the opposite were all the minerals are removed, but the tissue structure is preserved. 

Then there's also the possibility of non fertile soils for whatever reason, still high in minerals, that will fossilise even soft tissues. Because if the bacteria and fungi can't do their job, because the environment is hostile, the minerals in the soil will deposit in the tissues and cause those to fossilise as well.",,/r/europe/comments/dis3mj/roman_family_burial_site_with_a_carriage_and_two/f40mrfp/,EmilyU1F984,1571302325

But after threats from Chinese officials targeting her mother, Haitiwaji cancelled a planned appearance in March at a human rights summit in Geneva, according to two sources familiar with her plans.

4699,"&gt;It boils down to this. Europeans don't want refugees but they dont wan't to do the dirty job, arrest them, and push them back. They can do it.

Ok, but these are people. If you ""arrest them, and push them back"" they don't just vanish. That doesn't fix the problem. You need to push them back to somewhere. When you push them back they go to Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, etc, and we are in the exact same situation as we are now.

&gt;Here  is the plan. Europe should start pushing back migrants itself. Yes, it  won't pretty. Don't beg other to do it for you. Do it yourself. No more  threats from Recept Tayep Erdogan if we don't give him billions and  submit to whatever he wants. No more money for corrupt Lebanon. We make  it very clear to Turkey, Morocco, Lebanon, and others that if they don't  fix their shit, they can collapse. Take some responsability or you are  on your own. No more ""Miss Nice Europe"". Then you actually impose on  them your conditions of reforms if they want any help

Ok, so Europe becomes a big strong beautiful woman who don't need no man, and then the problem is fixed and the people stop existing? What do you think will happen to these people when they are dropped in Turkey? Turkey has two options:

1. **Keep these people**, settle them, take care of them.
2. **Don't keep these people**, lets them emigrate freely. Starve them. So what if they cross back into Europe.

What you are suggesting is Europe win a game of hot potato by throwing the potato to Turkey and never looking back because Europe is a strong beautiful woman who don't need no man. Don't you realise the whole problem is that Turkey will throw that hot potato right back at us? Have you considered that maybe Turkey is a strong beautiful woman who don't need no man as well?

4705,"We Hungarians have rarely had easy lives. As was the case with other nations that came under the direct domination of the Soviet Union in the 20th century, we had to struggle to retain our national culture and way of life. Yet our trials have prepared us well for the challenges of the 21st century.

After World War II, the Soviet Union foisted a social experiment on Hungary, forcing us to live in a Communist society for almost half a century. In 1956 we rebelled against the Soviet-backed regime in an effort to regain our national independence. Our revolution failed, however, and we paid a heavy price. Liberation would come decades later, after the collapse of the Soviet empire.

In the totalitarian regime imposed on Hungary by Communist Moscow, politics was practiced in impenetrable, smoke-filled back rooms. There was a total absence of information on the streets, so the public relied on gossip to find out what was happening.

At the same time, people couldn‚Äôt care less about who had and who hadn‚Äôt fallen out of grace with the Communist leadership. Society was split between Them (party members and careerists within the ramparts of power) and Us (those whose principal aim was to lead independent lives on the periphery).

Under Communism, it would have been unimaginable for me to go out with a party official or share a friendly word with an army or police officer. Such people existed in a different world than the rest of us. Anyone valued or decorated by officialdom was a nonperson in our eyes. We had our own heroes to look up to. We had the freedom fighters from ‚Äô56. We had our poets, like Gyorgy Petri; our writers, like Imre Kertesz; our painters, like Gabor Karatson (one of the most important forerunners of the Hungarian Green movement); we had our singers and historians.

The stifling atmosphere under Communism prevailed through the 1970s. But then, in the 1980s, things started to change. The old guard of Communist officials retired, and their successors didn‚Äôt care much for the regime‚Äôs official ideology; they were asobsessed as the old guard had become with accumulating money and influence. As a result, the regime became increasingly insecure, while we became more liberated and self-assured.

When Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader of the Soviet Union in 1985, we sensed that it was only a matter of time before the Hungarian regime unraveled. The veteran party leader Janos Kadar knew that Mr. Gorbachev‚Äôs reforms would be lethal, and he told the Soviet leader so.

He was right. The young officials who took power in the late ‚Äô80s soon accepted the inevitable and gave in to change. In June 1989, they permitted the reburial of Imre Nagy, the reform-minded former prime minister who was executed after the 1956 revolution. At this momentous occasion, the young Viktor Orban publicly called for free elections and demanded the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary.

In September 1989, the regime opened the Hungary-Austria border, allowing tens of thousands of East German refugees who had flooded into Hungary passage to West Germany. This destabilized the East German regime and unleashed a chain of events that would ultimately lead to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, and of Europe. ‚ÄúIt was in Hungary that the first stone was removed from the Berlin Wall,‚Äù Helmut Kohl, the former German chancellor, later recalled.

These were unforgettable days for us. In the summer of 1989, President George H.W. Bush visited Budapest and assured the leaders of the new opposition that the United States would not let Hungary down like it did in 1956. Free elections were finally held in 1990, and the representatives of the old regime were voted out of office. The Soviet Union withdrew its last troops from Hungary, and we left the Warsaw Pact.

Excited to regain control of our destiny and emerge from the Iron Curtain, we Hungarians na√Øvely believed that Western Europe would share in our elation. We thought that other nations would empathize with the suffering we had experienced under Communism and offer us a helping hand in overcoming the challenges we faced.

Sadly, instead of treating us as potential allies who were finally joining the free world, the nations of Western Europe treated us as vanquished losers of the Cold War who had to defer to their wisdom. They used economic power to gain control of our markets, then kept us waiting in the antechamber of the European Union for 15 years. We did not experience a genuine reunification with Western Europe. Instead, we were forced to adapt ourselves to the West. It never occurred to the West that perhaps it should adapt itself to us.

During this time, Brussels and its neoliberal economic agenda gained increasing sway over the member states of the European Union, effectively denying citizens the right to make their own economic choices. In doing so it degraded national elections across the Continent, reducing them to formal exercises in changing governments, not policies.

Meanwhile, in Hungary some of the successors of the old Communist regime managed to retain significant influence over the nation‚Äôs economic and cultural institutions.

Fortunately, their power was dealt a significant blow in 2010, when Mr. Orban was elected prime minister in a sweeping victory. The political elites who preferred to maintain the status quo during the 2008 financial crisis left Hungary‚Äôs middle class, as well as its most needy citizens, high and dry. This impaired the democratic legitimacy of Hungary‚Äôs governing parties, which is why voters looked in a new political direction.

Since then Mr. Orban has put Hungary‚Äôs interests first when crafting his economic policies, and he has refused to follow the policy directives laid down by European Union bureaucrats in Brussels. He has also worked to replace the neoliberal vanguard that led the country toward bankruptcy during the financial crisis. To bolster the economy, he imposed special levies on multinational companies and banks to distribute the burden of the crisis as proportionately as possible between the market players who caused it (and profited from it) and Hungary‚Äôs citizenry.

In 2014, Mr. Orban proclaimed that Hungary was breaking with the kind of early 21st-century liberalism that had been bankrupted so spectacularly in 2008. Instead, he declared a desire for a nonliberal society ‚Äî he called it ‚Äúilliberal‚Äù ‚Äî based on community, Christianity and solidarity. He understood that the West was suffering from a systemic crisis, in economic terms and within the liberal order itself.

Nine years have passed since Mr. Orban‚Äôs landslide victory in 2010, in which he won over two-thirds of parliamentary seats ‚Äî a feat he has since repeated twice. This is a clear demonstration of the popularity and success of his policies. Hungary‚Äôs economy is in good shape: Inflation and unemployment are at low levels; gross domestic product growth stands at about 5 percent; and real wages have increased by 40 percent in the past few years.

The nonliberal shift promoted by Mr. Orban and the spread of populism that it heralded were consequences of an imbalance within the liberal order, one that favored elites over the needs of everyday citizens. As liberalism runs out of steam, true majoritarian democracy and popular representation is returning to Hungary.

And the same is happening across Europe. In the European Parliamentary elections earlier this year, the ‚Äúpopulists‚Äù (democrats, in other words) significantly strengthened their position. The European electorate voted for a balance of stability and change ‚Äî for preserving the European Union without losing more member states, and for keeping alive all of the European Union‚Äôs worthwhile achievements while discarding anything that has proved unsustainable. Voters sent a clear message: They want more flexibility in politics, less ideological dogmatism and more readiness for compromise.

While some may not be able to accept it, the old world is disappearing. It can‚Äôt be saved. What can and should be saved is Western (Christian) civilization. We must realize that, as the historian Niall Ferguson once wrote, ‚Äúthe biggest threat to Western civilization is posed not by other civilizations, but by our own pusillanimity ‚Äî and by the historical ignorance that feeds it.‚Äù

We Hungarians are well aware that nobody has our best interests at heart other than ourselves. That‚Äôs why we continue to insist on liberty, democracy and our independence as a nation-state.

4757,"You talk like the US is going to be Europe‚Äôs bitch forever... The US‚Äôs primary ally is days out from leaving the EU. The EU‚Äôs rhetoric is getting more and more hostile towards the US each passing day. Europe doesn‚Äôt want the US military presence, and Americans don‚Äôt want the burden and expense of defending an ungrateful Europe.

On top of this, Turkey, a supposed NATO ally, just purchased an advanced SAM system from Russia, NATO‚Äôs primary adversary, despite being threatened with being kicked out of the F-35 program and being sanctioned. Turkey also just invaded Syria and began attacking the SDF, which is the US‚Äôs primary ally in the fight against Islamic State. At one point yesterday, the US deployed F-15‚Äôs and AH-64 Apache gunships as a show of force against Turkey, whose advance came extremely close to US special operators on the ground. There were mixed reports that US forces actually came under fire of Turkish forces, although there were no casualties on the US side.

There is now talk of further US sanctions on Turkey as well as the US getting their nukes out of Turkey.

Turkey‚Äôs actions just might be the driver to get the US to pull out of NATO altogether. President Trump has already been critical of NATO, which puts the primary defense burden of Europe squarely on the US, as European states refuse to appropriately fund for defense and the strategic deterrent. Also, it is becoming clear by Turkey‚Äôs recent actions and by France‚Äôs and Germany‚Äôs recent condemnations of the US that European interests are drifting and are no longer aligned.

Americans are tired of investing billions of tax dollars annually to people on the other side of the planet who take our money, use their own money to fund social programs like free healthcare and free education for their people, and give nothing but hatred and criticism in return.

The land Kurdish people want to \*create\* their nation is part of Turkey and Syria. Forming a Kurdish state would bring more war in the area because neither Turkey nor Syria will give their land willingly.

Look at what happened in last couple of days:

1- Turkey \*invaded\* Syria, bombing the Kurdish groups (PKK, YPG, or whatever you want to call them)

2- Bashar al-Assad (President of Syria) reached out to this group and made peace with the condition that these groups will be part of, and fight for Syrian army (2 days ago).

3- Syria finally reclaimed Kobane from ISIS (today).

What we will see in the upcoming days/weeks/montths is the stabilization of Syria as a nation and the refugees will finally go back from Europe/Turkey to their own country.

Did many Kurds die during this operation? Probably.

Do European countries care about them? No.

Do European countries pretend to care about them by denouncing Turkey but putting absolutely no sanctions/measures against Turkey? Yes.

Is Turkey the bad guy? Maybe, depending on where you look at it. If you are a Kurd, yes. If you are Assad, no. Turkey basically ensured that the Kurdish groups at northern region of Syria will agree to the leadership of Assad without any trouble.

Do people hate Turkey/Turkish government? Yes.

Does Turkish government care about being demonized as bad guys? No.

Why? Because there are unofficial 5million+ refugees in Turkey. This number is waaaaaay more than any number of refugees in any European country. According to the officials, Turkey spent 31 billion++ Euros for the refugees (this amount was announced at 04.2018).

&amp;#x200B;

Turkey wants a stable Syria back up yesterday so that these refugees can go back to their own lands and Turkish government is not afraid to be labeled as bad guy because if they do not bring stability to the land, it is projected that in only a couple of generations later Turkey will become an Arab state (Surprise surprise, refugees have a lot of children).

Koine Greek and modern Greek is very close. Even an illiterate old person can understand the bible (it is read in koine Greek in church).  Medieval/modern Greek are 99% the same. One could easily read (perfectly understand) a text from the 6th century AD. 

This has to do with lots of things: for instance  the language itself is not only very expressive so there's no need to alter but also very flexible. A huge factor is that there were always it had its own tailored native alphabet. In Greek you dont have to be taught  what the pronunciation of a written word is.  
 In other languages, English for instance they use the latin alphabet.  When writing down words the alphabet you use must support all the sounds of the language.

So are you talking about Spain bombing Catalunya? Well, you should know both the Italians and the Germans helped fascist Spain bomb Barcelona (and many other Catalan towns). The current Spanish regime is a direct descendant of 1936-1975 fascist Spain, only adapted to maintain appearances, but still run by the hardcore fascists, especially in the judiciary and military/police branches. You should know a famous hero of Spanish nationalism, which btw is a banal nationalism of the worst kinds, meaning Spanish nationalism does not even seem to officially exist, which makes its values, including supremacist views invisible to many people, said this: ""You have to bomb Barcelona at least once every 50 years"". Of course, Spanish heroes are mainly military Generals with long histories of spilling their own people's blood for the sake of their Empire. Just like the invasion of America and the bloodshed that ensued killing millions in the name of religion and the kingdom of Spain, or the romantic views even today you get of Torquemada, who ""defended Christianity"" (hence Spain) with the Inquisition against heretics (ie. anyone, heretic or not, not in a good standing with those in power).

Even one of the ""Fathers"" of the Spanish constitution, a member of the party in the government, mentioned this and joked with it as late as 2011, talking about keeping the Catalans instead of the Portuguese (you know, a real country west of Spain that the kingdom tried to subjugate but in doing so received a decisive humiliation in Batalha in the middle ages). Here's the video: https://youtu.be/-ARxy6ZBd4E.

This is a Spanish nationalist, who authored a good chunk of the Spanish 1978 constitution, talking about the Catalans and Portuguese as if he was entitled to ""ownership"" of peoples and lands. It closely matches the view of many Spanish nationalists of their country as an Empire which saw greater times in the past but nonetheless will reemerge from the ashes.

It is very arrogant to not even entertain the possibility of people actually taking to the streets because they are fed up of the Spanish State and the constant attacks against them, their culture, their institutions, and their governments.

Spain has never reached an acceptable level of democracy, but during the past 20 years it's been downhill, with most of the State apparatus run by the same oligarch families who ran Franco's regime, now becoming prominent again. There was no such thing as a transition from dictatorship to democracy, because the same people remained in power, and the same fascist, supremacist ideas remained ingrained: ""Spain is one, great and free"".

Such a transition provided a Spanish Constitution that was negotiated by private parties controlled by the military, where specific articles were imposed by the force of guns and the threat to keep on with the military dictatorship unless they got away with their objectives: the communists shall never be in power (go check why Spain is in its 4th general election next month in 4 years), and the Catalan, Basque and Galician people should be kept at all costs under Spain.

The Spanish State is a supremacist, nationalist organisation, because it is run by the same people who ran the country 50y ago. Even Germany and its banks were able to change the Spanish constitution in 2011 and in less than 24h after threatening Spain, but half the population of Catalunya over a decade, with the biggest demonstrations in Europe, with over a million peaceful souls, several times, got no way into even starting talks. 

They have no political representatives in the EU parliament (and that means around 2.5 million europeans are today not represented in the EU because the EU bent to the will of a rogue State), tainting the democracy in EU institutions, with states like Germany and France happy to look elsewhere, banned representatives in the Catalan parliament, banned representatives in the Spanish congress, repression all over the place with police making up ""evidence"" and illegally ""dissolving riots"" (ie. running over people, like this https://youtu.be/9y9noSfcVmE or using illegal weaponry resulting in critical wounds, ...) and judges banning discharging evidence in courts. Their leaders have been put in jail even though neither voting or organising a referendum is a crime and even declaring independence is also not punishable. There has been no violence, multiple offers of dialogue across the board and over and over again, over the years... all met with arrogance and dismissals, yet they just made up an State case against the Catalans.

What's worse, many Spaniards who are political dissidents also suffer from fascist Spain, but the media is consistently papering over and covering up, when not directly manipulating and adding confusion whenever something can't be outright hidden. These now have laws like the ""gag law"" which forbids protesting. You know, like, a basic right in any democracy. Freedom of association is also limited with such law, with 15+ people potentially becoming a ""violent uprising"". Police and judges have been handed the tools for repression, and now they are using those at will, against Catalans first, but also extending elsewhere.

Comparing Catalunya to Bavaria is a joke. According to the EU commission, in 2016 Catalonia ranked 68th out of 272 EU zones in GDP, but 163/272 in social progress. That's not natural, it is only an artifact of the above issues. The reason being the latter checks quality of life things like hospitals, schools, housing, environment and up to other 50+ factors which directly depend on public funding and are aggravated by the permanent exaggerated fiscal deficit it suffers. IOW, you'd see children in schools with latest technologies in classrooms up to 20 or 25 children in ""poor"" zones in Spain and then see Catalan children with aging facilities and no money to hire teachers with crowded classrooms of 30, 35 and quite often 40+ children. This patterns repeating all over the place and with many such factors.

And this is not to mention the cultural issues. In any case, the list goes on, and on, and on. Spain is not only a pseudo democracy, but it is also a failed State, and a few million people already broke ties with it.

4892,"I respect that since you are from Madrid you don't support independence. It's totally fine, you can be as much against it as you want. But I think you can still be honest and try not to tell some lies when expressing an opinion. I'm sure you know that many of the things you have said aren't true. And there's no need for that.

For instance you use the word nationalists a lot, when you are actually referring to most Catalans. When you talk about ""nationalists"" who don't agree with this judicial process, you are in fact talking about 80% of the Catalan population: [80% of Catalans oppose to this imprisonments of the Catalan leaders and activists](https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20180625/45381887877/sondeo-gad3-la-vanguardia-financiacion-solucion-conflicto-catalan.html). Parties like Podem show huge support and consider the jailed people to be Catalan prisoners. Not nationalists. Then there's the separation of powers issue, which is far from being perfect in Spain. Most of Spain's law experts who aren't from Catalonia have also criticized this rulings and how the judicial process has taken place. They aren't ""nationalists"".

That's why when you talk about ""nationalists"" in general you are not being sincere here. It goes beyond Catalan nationalists.

&gt; The proposed Catalan Constitution included provisions for unprecedented control over the judiciary. So I guess it's ""judges yes, but only if we can control them""?

This is not true. Here you have the Catalan constitution proposal: http://www.unanovaconstitucio.cat/articulat/. Which establishes a judiciary power way more independent from politicians than the one existing now in Spain's Congreso General del Poder Judicial. For instance, the Public Prosecutor won't be appointed by the Government as it's now the case of Spain. These are all facts, not something polemical or disputed. 

The link you shared is about the Law of juridical transition, as your link says. Not the Constitution. The Law of juridical transition was never intended to be a Constitution.

&gt; yet forget that democracy is much more than a parliament, and constantly undermine said parliament by neglecting the rights of the opposition parties, 

You used the word ""constantly"", when your link refers only to what happened on September 2017. It's not true that the Catalan Parliament neglects the rights of other parties constantly. If that were true, such parties would immediately sent Catalan government Courts. Ciudadanos wouldn't hesitate for a second. 

It's true tho that the way the laws were approved in September 2017 got criticism for the way it was conducted, not giving the opportunity to have longer debates. Even tho it still was legal ([El Constitucional avala la reforma del reglamento del Parlament que impulsaron JxS√≠ y la CUP](https://www.eldiario.es/catalunya/politica/Constitucional-reglamento-Parlament-JxSi-CUP_0_713229236.html))

&gt; Now, in a federal polity the one thing that MUST NEVER HAPPEN is for State laws to supersede federal laws.

You are overcomplicating yourself here. It's a [unilateral declaration of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateral_declaration_of_independence). It doesn't matter whether the state is federal or unitary. A unilateral declaration of independence will always be illegal from that State's perspective. Like USA unilateral independence, Philippines unilateral independence, Kosovo unilateral independence or any other unilateral declaration of independence in history ([examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateral_declaration_of_independence#Examples)).

&gt; Democratic institutions and services have to abide by the law and be neutral on political issues. Note I am saying institutions, not politicians. Once again, the nationalists have shown their contempt for any attempt at neutrality, breaking the neutrality of public buildings, sending official notes to parents to encourage their children to go to the strikes, etc

Here you are doing it again. Podem is not a Catalan nationalist party, and also hang yellow ribbons in their official buildings. Which according to many experts it's not breaking neutrality of public buildings, since those buildings aren't neutral to begin with. For instance Manuela Carmena in Madrid's mayor hang messages in support of refugees in City Council building. This happens all over Spain. It isn't something about the ""Catalan nationalists"". Its not illegal and they can do it.

&gt; sending official notes to parents to encourage their children to go to the strikes, etc.

I don't know about this. When this happened?

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;Having a parliament is not the be-all end-all of democracy.

We totally agree on this. What you seem to miss, however, is that democracy (and *federal* democracy, as Spain is) *does* include elements that the Catalan nationalists ignore constantly because they go against ""the will of the people"" (does that remind you of any other bullshit nationalist movement in recent years?):

* Judges and separation of powers are an integral part of democracy. Yet any judicial decision against them is expressed by the nationalists as [""anti-democratic""](https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2018-09-22/jueces-cataluna-govern-proces-diana_1619591/). The proposed Catalan Constitution included provisions for [unprecedented control over the judiciary](https://cronicaglobal.elespanol.com/politica/ley-transitoriedad-control-politico-jueces-fiscales_84158_102.html). So I guess it's ""judges yes, but only if we can control them""?
* Torra and the nationalists repeatedly claim that they only owe themselves to the Parlament, the seat of the ""Catalan people's sovereignty"", yet forget that democracy is much more than a parliament, and constantly undermine said parliament by [neglecting the rights of the opposition parties](https://www.eldiario.es/catalunya/politica/septiembre-jornadas-rompieron-Parlament_0_809469224.html), which by the way have only a couple of seats below a majority and have a majority of the votes. In truth, it seems they only care for the Parlament in as much as they can use it to foster their plans.
* In a federal polity, it is crucial the division of powers between the federated entities and the federal head/center1. Now, in a federal polity the one thing that MUST NEVER HAPPEN is for State laws to supersede federal laws. This is not a thing only in ""fascist Spain"" but literally in ANY federal country. We can agree or disagree on specific points of the Estatut and whether it should be a regional power or a federal power, but there are some things which are *clearly* a federal power (foreign policy, etc.) and yet the Catalan government decides to go ahead and ignore it. Yes, some of the things the Catalan Parliament passes are very much illegal, *because Catalonia does not have the powers to do those things*. And this goes both way, by the way. Encroachments of the federal government onto the regional governments are also protected against: Vox (far-right party) can't eliminate the Autonomous Regions and centralize everything without a nigh-impossible constitutional reform, and so on.
* The ""tyranny of the majority"" is a real thing in constitutional theory, for as much as the nationalists (of all kinds, not just Catalans) love to rant about the ""will of the people"". A majority has to be very strong to remove certain rights from a minority, and for some rights no majority (no matter how big) can remove those rights. This ties in with all the other points: division of powers and federal-State divisions and protections exist almost entirely to protect against the tyranny of the majority. Every time the nationalists claim that the ""reject antidemocratic court mandates"" or say that they ""represent the will of the people"" or similar, they are claiming the right to remove those protections and let the mob decide for everyone: if a group of enough people wants to, your rights can be forfeit.
* Democratic institutions and services have to abide by the law and be neutral on political issues. Note I am saying *institutions*, not politicians. Once again, the nationalists have shown their contempt for any attempt at neutrality, [breaking the neutrality of public buildings](https://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2019/05/27/5cebb104fc6c83177f8b459b.html), sending official notes to parents to encourage their children to go to the strikes, etc. This also happens at a micro level, with individual persons in their own workspaces. I mean, after all, the government represents ""the people"", right? So surely ""the people"" is fully behind the government? This ties back to the nationalists saying ""the people of Catalonia want X"". Do they think that everyone supports them (they don't, less than half of the people vote for independence parties)... or in a more sinister manner, think those that don't support them are not Catalans?

So yes, I agree that democracy is much more than a parliament, but let's not pretend that the nationalists think that democracy is much more than ""the will of the people"", no matter the cost and those that are opposing you. Please don't claim they care about real democracy, because they don't. They have routinely demonstrated

1Spain is officially unitary, but its Constitution and laws has evolved in a federal fashion over the years, and right now all of Spain are Autonomous Communities with ample powers over education, healthcare, social policy, taxes, etc. Some have special privileges over taxation (Basque Country, Navarre) and others protect and promote their regional languages (those two plus Catalonia, Galicia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands), with other regions thinking of adding their own languages (Asturias).

&gt;Spanish right wing parties are calling for a second suspension of Catalan autonomy and the illegalisation of pro-independence parties.

Don't worry, those things are unconstitutional and if they tried the Constitutional Court would block them :)

&gt;This is not a climate of political freedom.

So... the nationalists have toppled the last two governments in Madrid... and they still govern in Catalonia... and this last two days there have been more policemen injured in the protests than people arrested ([link](https://www.eldiario.es/politica/protestas-Cataluna-agentes-heridos-detenidos_0_953304744.html))... and as we can see in this post thousands of people are calmly walking towards Barcelona blocking the road...

This part, sure. It's a part of national education which is unfortunate.

I don't particularly feel guilty for it, but denying the systemic killing and displacement of 500,000+ Armenians is fucking stupid, so don't listen to most Turks either. Armenians didn't just up and move to the other side of the mountain or the middle of a barren desert because they felt like it.

Political opposition has mostly been reacting to the way the operation has been conducted, and the chauvinistic shitshow that has been going on across Turkey.

5031,"You are correct to point out there are lots of idiots, but consider this, Turkish nationalism and in turn any nationalism are fed by marginalising and alienising done by Europe. Turks are rejected to the EU by France and Greece + Cyprus so many times now they have became apathethic to the notion of becoming liberal. And plus, liberalism never came to the this part of the continent because of the USA. We hate Americans more than Greeks or Armenians as a whole, this makes it harder for us to accept American ideals and ideas.

And again, the idiots you mentioned screaming Armenians deserved it? The reason is whenever a Turk mentions being Turkish to someone, most likely from Armenian diaspora, a dude comes out and says ""HEY UGLY TURK WHAT ABOUT ARMENIAN GENOCIDE, GOTCHA HAHAHAHA"" It became a meme around Turkish community, whataboutism of Europeans. Whenever a Turkish talks anywhere, Armenian Diaspora pours in to scream about genocide.

PSA: I don't deny the genocide happened. I know that it happened. But I also think Europeans did much worse to more people and they iignore their past. Not talking about Germans, talking about French and Belgian atrocities in Africa. France completely denies it, Belgians say ""but it was the king not us!"". Every single country except Germany denies their holocaust. Its hypocritical.

There are lots of Armenian movie stars we love. Thats why SOAD drummer loved those movies and grew up with them.
And the quote from SOAD: JD: Evet, √ßok iyi biliyorlardƒ±. Her iki b√ºy√ºkannem ve b√ºy√ºkbabam √ßok iyi T√ºrk√ße konu≈üuyordu.

5067,"Then I'd ask Catalonians: can you reform current institutions so that you can [insert cultural symbol here] do this?
I do not believe an independent state would necessarily grant more political power to Catalonia. Yes, you would have more legislative independence. But if you want to have business with other countries you'd still need to comply to European (i.e. Spanish) regulations. 

Besides, the EU has significant political and economic power at the international scene. Spain also has substantial political power in the Spanish-speaking world and Catalonia would not be capable of leveraging it anymore. 

I don't really like referendums. I think they do not really express any rational decision of voters because the alternatives on the ballot are fuzzy at best.
While people know what is the current situation, they do not know what does it mean to become independent. What's the plan? Are you gonna remain within the EU? Euro? Freedom of movement with Spain?

Once there is a plan, then you can have a referendum. To make a rational decision, you need to compare a proposal to leave with the current situation. This is how any political decision in the world is made, from the smallest to the biggest. The vote is always the last thing to do. And the referendum shouldn't be any different. People should know what they are voting for. The campaign should be focused on the merits and problems of the proposal.

As in Brexit, I think no proposal the Independentists could make would defeat the current situation. And that is why they do not want to advance with any kind of proposal.

Radical groups have set cars on fire and threw stones at agents  a new day of violence

The Mossos d'Esquadra have arrested a person during the riots in Barcelona in the protests of the CDR for the ruling of the 1-O summoned on Wednesday afternoon, Catalan police reported. The Sistema d'Emerg√®ncies M√®diques (Sem), have carried out 11 health services in the city of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãand have moved four to medical centers, as they have reported.

Catalan police say the activists have thrown acid and large stones at the police line in Tetuan Square, burned containers and created barricades. Groups of hooded men have dismantled a building scaffold from a building to accumulate material on the ground and set it on fire. Several cars have burned in the Roger de Flor area, near a gas station, and the flames have been at some times near the buildings.

According to a video broadcast by Ser Catalunya on Twitter, a neighbor of Roger de Flor has left his house alerted by the flames with his baby in his arm, scared if the flames reached his house. At 22.20 hours numerous disturbances followed in the area near the Department of Interior of the Generalitat, on Diputaci√≥n Street, where charges have begun.

Chinas VC investment is a result of state strategy and funds. Europe didn't use the same strategy for handling the great recession and doesn't do ultra heavy intervention in the economy like China.


At the advice of the economist Mazzucato, the EU has adopted a new strategy to drive innovation (this actually started several years ago, but it takes time to take effect), part of which is venture investment.

[Here](https://www.keele.ac.uk/equalitydiversity/equalityawards/raceequalitycharter/keeledecolonisingthecurriculumnetwork/#keele-manifesto-for-decolonising-the-curriculum) is an example of the manifesto of a uni with a program aiming to decolonialise their curriculum, relevant quote:

&gt;Decolonising is about rethinking, reframing and reconstructing the current curriculum in order to make it better, and more inclusive. ¬†It is about expanding our notions of good literature so it doesn‚Äôt always elevate one voice, one experience, and one way of being in the world. ¬†It is about considering how different frameworks, traditions and knowledge projects can inform each other, how multiple voices can be heard, and how new perspectives emerge from mutual learning.  
&gt;  
&gt;Decolonising is not just about bringing in minority ethnic writers and texts, but also how we read ‚Äòtraditional mainstream‚Äô texts. ¬†Decolonising is far more nuanced than just replacing authors, and it is more than just the topics covered in a course.¬† It concerns not only what is taught and how it is critiqued, but how it is taught, which gives rise to an understanding of decolonisation that addresses how academic literacies are experienced.  
&gt;  
&gt;Decolonising means identifying ways in which the university structurally reproduces colonial hierarchies; confronting, challenging and rejecting the status quo; and reimagining them and putting alternatives into practice for the benefit of our academic integrity and our social viability.  
&gt;  
&gt;Decolonising the curriculum means creating spaces and resources for a dialogue among all members of the university on how to imagine and envision all cultures and knowledge systems in the curriculum, and with respect to what is being taught and how it frames the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;Decolonisation is not a project over which one group can claim sole custodianship. Non-white and white academics and students are in this together. This will involve conscious, deliberate, non-hypocritical and diligent interest by both non-white and white members of the university in all knowledge systems, cultures, peoples and languages.

5264,"&gt; Most ""turcisms"" in Serbia actually originate from the Slavic-Iranian connection, they're just reinstated words.

Not likely linguistics-wise. Sure, there are several Persian-rooted words in Turkish which may have transferred to Serbian but the thing is that the transfer would happen from Turkish to Serbian considering the 450 years of Turkish rule in the region. One can not expect those words to have transferred via thousands years old Proto-Indo-European bonds, bypassing the much much recent and much long Turkish effect/exchange/control in the region.

Only if words are very integral ones to the language, such as *go, come, do, say, one, two, three, hand, eye* etc. then such old transitions might be explainable.

First of all, China had an agreement with HK which they call the one country two systems that was signed and promised to be kept in exchange for the departure of the british and having HK be part of china. Spain has never ever signed, agreed or promised independence, referendums or anything else to catalonians.

Since they did not do the first part, Spain couldn't do the second one which is ignoring the agreement signed with HK under the one country two system policy.

As far as this has gotten yet, Spain have yet to kill or ""dissapear"" anyone or have its police shot people with bullets.

On more news, the independentists only protested to the charge of rebellion that was initially pinned on the now sentenced prisoners. This charge has been dropped now, so they got it their way. The sentence, while I respect opinions that consider it unjust, is not even close to be as punishing as propaganda make it to be. For started the rebellion charge was dropped, secondly, the prison time for the different charges isn't added. If they were throwing the book a them, we'd be seeing prison times of twice or thrice the current. Does that make it just? No, but this isnt the trow the book/make an example of sentence the processist make it to be, not even by a long shot.

Taking it furhter, the people now in jail were the sole culprits of the failure of the independence declaration. First because it was a lie from the get go, so I reckon is difficult to deliver what they promised, but they didn't need to rush anything, they were doing good, propaganda was working in and out of catalonia, and their story was the story everyone had on their heads and then they blasted it on their own by telling all the world live on TV that it was all a lie. Is like if Lam passed the extradition law, then HK people protested on her favor.

Last but not least, its not Spain's police who's at the frontline of riots, its catalonia's own police force who is. Then you have the president cheering the protestors on to further go with the protest and then you have the interior minister of the same govern deliver the police to stop the riots. Imagine having Lam cheering the protestors on? I though so.

They tried to copy the airport thing, thats about what is in common with HK protests. I don't know you, but I don't empathize the same with a family shaking of cold under a bridge complaining about the lack of comodities than with Esperanza Aguirre complaining how expensive is to keep the heat on on her palace, even tho both of them are probably having cold.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/dio9i1/spains_pm_seeks_joint_response_to_growing_street/f3xwj5c/,Nerlian,1571245037

That being said, what the article outlines is straight up cruelty.

5783,"&gt; I could say the same thing about you, you're covering for what the Greek side did. Cyprus was independent and free of occupiers, why wasn't that enough? So you deposed the government and started to massacre Turkish Cypriots. To what end? What was the end goal here? And now you want to act like you didn't depose an independent Cypriot government and you didn't attack the other side. ""Just withdraw the troops and we can go back to after the moment you deposed Makarios."" 

No i'm not, what are you on about? When did i cover that? The deposing of the government started by the Greek junta. The motive and the goal was Enosis (the union) because 80% of the island was inhabited by Greeks and the vast majority wanted to be united with Greece. Hardly an unreasonable desire but the means of course were wrong and disastrous. I have never defended that. Killings happened by both sides however. The TMT had its fair share of killing civilians etc. Both sides were pitted against each other (largely by the British). 

The deposing happened and it was wrong obviously. Turkey invaded, people died (more people on the Greek Cypriot side, than the Turkish Cypriots that had died during the massacres) and the Junta fell (thanks for that btw, no sarcasm). However what Turkey did is just as wrong if not worse. You're occupying another country for 45 years and you're holding the island a hostage with your armed forces with the pretense of protecting the TCypriots from that happening again which is a joke. 

&gt; They're were no settlers on 1974. And the constitution did provide equal status. If the Greek side supports all that then why did you depose the government? 

By ""you"" i'm assuming you mean the Greek Cypriots, not Greece. They're different things. I explained above why it happened. Both Greece and Cyprus (or its vast majority) wanted to be united. The thing is that military Junta tried to force that. Of course it wasn't good or right. I'm not saying there was a good reason for that.

&gt; You keep bringing up settlers. But there were 0 settlers in 1974. 

I'm not talking about 1974 though. The 1974 deal ended with Turkey's intervention and the Junta being toppled.  Yes there were 0 settlers in 1974. But then after the violence had ceased there were settlers. To what end? To solidify Turkey's occupation of the island. That was my point, Turkey did exactly what it blamed Greece for trying to do.

&gt; Like I said you want Cyprus to be a Greek state with minority status. 

I don't think you know what minority means. Minority doesn't equal less rights. Even before 1974 the Turkish Cypriots were a minority cause they were 20% of the population. 

You want the island to be 50% Turkish Cypriots i'm assuming. Why? How do you justify that? 

&gt; How many of those 2000 are even inhabitable? They're little rocks out in the sea. You seek to own all of the Aegean based on barren rocks. And I'm not even hung up on that. Let Greece declare 12 miles. But it would be nice if they didn't for the islands that turn the Turkish territorial waters into tiny disconnected bubbles. Basically Turkey can't move its fleet without permission from Greece. 

That's the thing, it doesn't matter. Territory is territory regardless of whether people live there or not. We might choose to inhabit them, we might not. It doesn't matter and it's none of Turkey's business. I don't think that borders only apply when the islands are habitable. Yes, Turkey can't move its fleet in between our islands without permission from Greece. just like Greece can't move its fleet through the straights to have access to the Black Sea without permission from Turkey. Turkey has access to the southern Mediterranean from its southern part, and other than that, turkish (non military) vessels can still pass through the Aegean according to the law of innocent passage. So yes, fleets are restricted when passing in between other country's land masses like islands. Who would have known?? 

&gt; If they had a crystal ball back in the day perhaps. Our borders were settled on a different set of facts. 

That argument is stupid, it could be used by every country. Yes things and laws change in time. Go figure. All countries would have acted differently in one way or another had they known the future. What are we even talking about here? lol

&gt; Because you're acting like Turkey's behavior is super alien and unreasonable. 

I just explained to you that ""it's my interest"" doesn't equal ""it's reasonable"". It's in our iterest to have Gibraltar. Is it reasonable? No. Turkey asking for control in a sea in which it has almost 0 territory is indeed unreasonable. Greece wanting to extend its borders as per international (and customary) law *is* reasonble and that's why the law has customary status, cause all countries find it to be reasonable and that's also why all these countries support Greece in this. Literally you're the only ones saying your request is reasonable.

If you want to move to Berlin, make sure you start early enough looking for a place. Rule of thumb: the more central, the harder it gets; it's much easier outside of the area that is roughly indicated by the subway circle line (S41/42).

Other problems include: the ""Berliner Schnauze"" (people from Berlin are even more direct and flippant than average Germans), longer commutes in full subways/busses (it's a big city with more than one centre), public administration is slower (or rather faster, but with a much higher workload) than elsewhere and, at least to me, the city makes you crazy with time. 

To the last point: I realize this doesn't seem to make sense. Berlin has a lot of open, green spaces, is probably more relaxed than other cities of that size, there's a lot to do and nature is just around the corner - but when I lived there it still managed to tear on my mental health.

5855,"At the Coliseum, the premiere of the movie Breakthrough about the Battle of Menina Mountain

 Ljubljana, October 15 - The breakthrough of the film Breakthrough will be held in the Colosseum.  The story of the film is based on the book Past on Menina Mountain, written by the partisan commander Franc Sever Franta, who, in 1945, saved the lives of nearly 500 fighters and fighters through the battle of Menina Mountain.  The film's director is signed by Dejan Babosek.

 1/1

 In the harsh winter, a group of 500 partisans retreated to the high plateau, surrounded by 12,000 troops in the valleys surrounded by a SS division.  Commander Frante faced an impossible task when he had to rescue his fighters from an airtight ring.  After an all-day bloody battle, they managed to get through the ring to freedom, the contents of what happened in March 1945 were summarized on the Colosseum's website.

 In the movie, the viewer follows the now 96-year-old Franto, who writes memories, reminiscing about those difficult days when he and his teammates found themselves in impossible circumstances, and he had to, as a commander who was not yet 22 years old,  take responsibility for their lives.

 The film was made in cooperation between Narayan Production, the Association of fighters for values ‚Äã‚Äãof the National Liberation War of Slovenia and the Cultural and Historical Society of Triglav.  According to the Colosseum website, the battle on Menina Planina is considered an epic of Slovenian partisanship.  In the spirit of the time when the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the National Liberation Movement in Slovene society have been eroded, the Association of the Association of Fighters for the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the National Liberation Movement of Slovenia wishes to present the National Liberation Movement as an inspiration for future generations.

 Babosek, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Martin Horvat, told the STA that the idea for the movie came about ""on two fronts"" at the same time.  On the one hand, there was a celebration at Menina Planina in 2018, where one of the producers of the film Alja≈æ Verhovnik talked to Franta that it would be a good idea to make a movie after the story from Menina planina.  At the same time, at the same time, he heard about this story at the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Union of Fighters.  When she and the Supreme Master, whom they had previously worked with, got together, they began to work more actively on the project.

 The film was made on Velika planina and in the surrounding area and in Kamnik with its surroundings.  It was filmed in 12 shooting days and filmed in harsh winter conditions when temperatures were below zero.  As Babosek said, historical film is definitely a more demanding form, with a great emphasis on costume and set design.  He was not particularly involved in partisan film, but worked primarily under the historical rules of artisanal filmmaking.

 Young Franto is played by Domen Valic.  Babosek, as Babosek said, has worked with him in the past, so he felt he was well suited to the role.  Denys Bilash, who plays one of the surviving fighters, has starred in his short film Fear, and he has seen other projects in Jerne Ga≈°perin, Lovro Zafred and Ana Spik and found him suitable for his film.

 The film also stars Rok Vihar, Marko Plantan, Tjan Premzl, Darko Nikolovski, Jan Bucar, Valentina Plaskan, Darja Krhin, Andrei Lenart, Miha Rodman and Dominik Vodopivec.

 The producers are also Babosek and Jernej Brajer, director of photography is Gregor Kitek, music for the film was Tim ≈Ωibrat, costume designer is Barbara Drmota, set designer is Ur≈°ka Mazej, editing is signed by Babosek, sound design Borut Berden, mask was provided by Darja Krhin and Barbara Hren  .
