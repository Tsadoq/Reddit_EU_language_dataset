&gt;The purpose of the area bombardment of cities was laid out in a British Air Staff paper, dated 23 September 1941:

The ultimate aim of an attack on a town area is to break the morale of the population which occupies it. To ensure this, we must achieve two things: first, we must make the town physically uninhabitable and, secondly, we must make the people conscious of constant personal danger. The immediate aim, is therefore, twofold, namely, to produce (i) destruction and (ii) fear of death.[154]",Lower Saxony (Germany),/r/europe/comments/k1x67x/berlin_in_1945/gduswvd/,Aromatic_Reindeer,1606558804

This firman has not been found in the Ottoman archives despite its wealth of documents from the same period. 

In 1949, multiple professors of Turkish Studies at the University of Crete have argued that ""any expert in Ottoman diplomatic language can easily ascertain that the original of the document which has survived was not a firman"".

95,"Most ancient could be from the 800s (not as impressive as Greeks tho) and there are Hungarian artifacts in Germany and Austria from that time period

But to take a more known example, during the world war the Hungarian holy crown (one off the oldest crowns still intact) was captured by the Americans and brought to the USA. During the communist period the Americans refused to give it back and I firmly belive that it's a good thing.

I am not saying that everything should stay in Britain, but that artifacts from countries that aren't stabel enough to take care off those should stay in Britain. 

Let's be real, if the Americans gave the crown back the commies would have melted it down and one more artifact from European history would be lost. 

I'm not saying that Greece shouldn't have her own relics since Greece is a political stabel country with democratic regimes. On the other hand if the communist won in the Greek Civil War I belive most Greeks wouldn't be so unhappy that their heritage wasn't destroyed by them.

However, Trump did enable him, he did not warn anyone else in NATO and his action is what caused the declaration that NATO was brain-dead.

&gt;Also Troops were already in Syria when he got into office due to Obama's deployment so technically it wasn't his adventure? 

Troops are back in Irak as well, so it's not as if his administration was without it's military pushes. To be fair to him , the situation in Syria did not start with his administration.  

&gt;When he wanted to extract them people got angry even though this was something people had demanded for years.

It was a erratic move, it got people killed. I remember it apparently confused British and French Commandos in the area, who weren't even warned and it gave a propaganda victory to the Syrian and Russian regime when they confronted Turkey.

There's a criticism of extracting troops, and there's one of **extracting troops badly**. 
 
Not to mention that the US didn't leave. There's still troops in the area, if this was a move to pull out it was botched, because American troops did sheepishly move back after a loss of credibility and some bases.

382,"&gt;  There is an important difference between the slow cultural spread through upper classes up until the revolution and the fast imposition of the hegemonic language on everybody afterwards.

The point is that everybody who had any impact on society prior to the Revolution already had some command of French. French becoming generalized was only a question of time, not policies. Much like the rest of Europe.

&gt;Not speaking about some of your assertion that French was normalized already in the XII century and that the French kingdom was centralized.

The French pan-dialectal scripta came around the 12th c. Centralization started out slowly under the direct Capetians and massively accelerated under the Valois due to pressure from England. See Charles VII and Louis XI. Those are pretty basic historical facts, not « assertions ».

&gt;And that French was somehow the only language by the time of the printing press. This is just plain false.

It was by and large the only language besides Latin printed in France, that's correct. Although to be accurate the early printing industry in the South-West (Toulouse) produced a few books in Castillan and even Catalan. Books in Occitan were rare, even though the language had millions upon millions of speakers. But literacy in Occitan was almost non-existent outside of Béarn, Toulouse and the merchant class of Marseille. Someone who wanted to achieve basic literacy in the South then would have likely done so in French. Someone who wanted to achieve a high level of literacy would have learned Latin, Greek, possibly Hebrew and French. That's how you end up with Montaigne, possibly the most significant French writer of the Renaissance, being a **native speaker** of Latin and writing in French for the larger public (including women) while not being known for having ever spoken or written the Périgord dialect of Occitan, the native language of his area.",France,/r/europe/comments/k1xfwr/french_vs_german/gdu6ltg/,Bayart,1606539852

602,"&gt;My point of ASALA is rather comparing the damage they do to Turkish acceptance to today’s lobbying damage done to Turkish acceptance of the genocide.  

I know, its why I said I only mentioned it because lots of people seem to think Armenians support/supported ASALA.  

&gt;Maybe in less than a decade Turkey can accept the genocide and build a lovely memorial in Van if this started today. 

One really big gesture that might satisfy Armenians enough to give Turkey some time to recognize it without pressure would be this, but more so if some of the old Armenian names were put alongside the Turkish/Kurdish ones on maps and on signs. Like ""Welcome to Erzerum/Garin"". Better yet if some of the signs were translated into Armenian too (Western Armenian specifically). Like any of that along with the ability to safely visit would probably be enough for Armenians to calm down a bit and let Turkey come to terms with its history on its own. 

&gt;Turks in the 80s were closer to accepting the genocide I would even say 1/3(or more) had a rather positive opinion for accepting the genocide.

I had no idea that it was even possible at one point in time. 

&gt;As I said gradually improving relations instead of constantly pressuring and attempts to undermine.

The issue is that for Armenians, genocide recognition is of utmost importance. So its very unlikely for them to take a step back and say, ""Ok, your turn to do something"". Not unless there is some kind of guarantee that Turkey will actually recognize it (which I know, is not realistic given that it is an honor issue, but I'm just trying to convey what most Armenians would say). I guess the only solution is for everybody to suck up their pride, for Armenians to give Turkey some time and for Turkey to recognize it sooner rather than later before Armenians get impatient.",,/r/europe/comments/k1xfry/turkey_for_beginners/gdt39s2/,Imperator-Rome_95-BC,1606515300

697,"I would love if people called old Armenian towns by their Armenian name time to time just like Izmir people call the city Smyrna sometimes. 

About safely visiting I mean just imagine that alone will make Turkey have better relations with Armenia. Local population will get used to Armenians and they will gain big deal of money from tourism considering North-East gets almost no tourism flow. 

So I believe Turkey should guarantee safe visit to those areas and this might be an important early step.

You should read about Turgut Ozal and his period and propositions for accepting the Armenian genocide. People around him and his party were looking very warm on that issue it was mainly always pushed back because of famous diplomats getting assassinated and the fact that he can’t bring that up while this stuff happens and sadly he died(claims of assassination)before he could achieve this but maybe if not ASALA he was going to make this happen during his lifetime.

Turkey can do this kind of gestures only if Armenia doesn’t constantly attack everything Turkey and Turkish. I understand it’s a pride issue but both nations should calm down a little and at least act like normal neighbours until they can finally become normal neighbours because there’s no way one side steps down as I see it. It has to be a gradual process no matter what it can’t get recognised because of a protest.

(1) Die deutsche Sprache ist, unbeschadet der den sprachlichen Minderheiten bundesgesetzlich eingeräumten Rechte, die Staatssprache der Republik.
(2) Die Republik (Bund, Länder und Gemeinden) bekennt sich zu ihrer gewachsenen sprachlichen und kulturellen Vielfalt, die in den autochthonen Volksgruppen zum Ausdruck kommt. Sprache und Kultur, Bestand und Erhaltung dieser Volksgruppen sind zu achten, zu sichern und zu fördern.“

TV is made with monetary gain in mind so they are trying to reach the biggest audience which in Austria speaks standard German (88%).
In schools they have been teaching a standardized German for over 100 years since officials from one region of the KuK needed to be able to work just as efficiently in North Tirol as in Hungary.
I personally would appreciate the maintainance of the language. In Northern Germany many schools offer classes on Low German. I would not argue for the entire educating to be done in that language though, nor would I support ambitions of making Low German the exclusive or even main language of the area. It helps to establish a sense of unity of a small group at the price of excluding oneself from a large group.

1153,"The question comes down to two main pilllars. Geography and culture.

Paris is not in South America, but Istanbul is in Europe (more than 10m ppl excluding other Thracian cities of Turkey). That's quite a difference. And posting something about France which also contains stuff related to, let's say, French Guiana on a South American subreddit would be totally legit. Additionally, European part of Turkey is still larger than many proper European countries. Geographically speaking, Turkey is part of Europe. End of discussion. On the other hand Cyprus is almost (some sources say otherwise) completely outside of European continental borders.

Which leads us to the second aspect: Culture. I am not saying Turkey is completely European. It is not. It is also not completely Middle Eastern or Asian. Turkey is just Turkey and a part of both Europe and Asia. Considering Europe without it's Turkish influence (especially Balkans) is just a wishful thinking for cultural conservatives. If we were going to think only on cultural aspects Turkey would have its own continent or even own planet.

As a result I can confidently say, sharing posts about countries like Turkey, Kazakhistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Cyprus is completely in the context of this subreddit.

A lot of people, especially in rural areas only have acces these types of mediums, so naturally, they believe it.

1403,"AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine looks like it’s headed for an additional global trial as the drugmaker tries to clear up uncertainty and confusion surrounding favorable results in its current study.

The company wants the new test to confirm the 90% efficacy rate that the shot showed in a portion of an existing trial, Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said. It’s favoring that option rather than adding an arm to a separate study that’s already underway in the U.S.

Questions are mounting over one of the fastest-moving shots after the company acknowledged that a lower dosage level that appeared more effective resulted from a manufacturing discrepancy. The company and its partner, the University of Oxford, didn’t initially disclose the error and other key details, leading to concern over their transparency.

“Now that we’ve found what looks like a better efficacy we have to validate this, so we need to do an additional study,” Soriot said in his first interview since the data were released. It will probably be another “international study, but this one could be faster because we know the efficacy is high so we need a smaller number of patients.”

Soriot said he didn’t expect the additional trial to hold up regulatory approvals in the U.K. and European Union.

The U.K. government said Friday it had asked the medicines regulator to assess whether the Astra-Oxford vaccine was suitable for temporary authorization. The unusual step comes after the government amended legislation in light of the pandemic to allow the U.K. to approve a vaccine ahead of the European regulator, which Britain is still subject to until January.

Clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may take longer because the regulator is unlikely to approve the vaccine on the basis of studies conducted elsewhere, especially given the questions over the results, Soriot said. Authorization in some countries is still expected before the end of the year, he said.

“The question for us was, will we need the U.S. data to get approval in the U.S. or can we get approval in the U.S. with international data, and it was never clear,” said Soriot, who is in quarantine after arriving in Australia. “Now with those results it’s more likely that we will need the U.S. data.”

Astra and its CEO are facing scrutiny as the drugmaker responds to growing confusion over the vaccine. The company’s late-stage data initially increased confidence that the world would soon have multiple shots to combat the pathogen, following positive reports from front-runners Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. But scant disclosures and the manufacturing discrepancy have sparked doubts among scientists and investors.",,/r/europe/comments/k1vrhr/astrazeneca_eyes_extra_global_vaccine_trial_as/gdqpwv3/,yolo4everlmi,1606457823

1421,"I have always been fairly center right, and more libertarian, but I was actually curious about what Marx actually wrote because nobody ever actually reads Marx for a man who is talked about all the time.

I was legitimately angry after reading it. Marx was clearly smart, and knew what he was doing. He was interested in the actual mathematical models, but he legitimately deceived the reader. How the fuck do you write and publish a 1,000 page book during your lifetime while hiding the answer to your problem you identified? I had some sympathy for Marx because volume II and III of Das Kapital were only published after his death, so at least I think he had the decency that he didn’t want to publish them during his lifetime cause he knew his solutions were shit.  But that doesn’t excuse him for having the chutzpah to write all that nonsense in volume I in which he had unexplained contractions which he never had a solution for. The law of value is in flat fucking contradiction to the tendency of the rate of profit to fall!!


You have to be actually stupid to believe his shit, because there’s well enough literature documenting all his economics issues. And these were issues he was aware of when he was writing. You would literally need to close your eyes and ears and deliberately avoid reading any of the literary on his ideas to believe them. 


If you read like, Wealth of Nations, Adam smith is concise and to the point. He uses clear examples and writes in clear prose.

Varoufakis has some common sense tho. He is the only self ascribed Marxist I give any time of day really.

He is more of a Hegelian tbh, and some other principles.

1592,"&gt; The US and Canada have ""birth tourism"", where rich people from abroad literally visit their countries just to have babies, get the citizenship, and then leave the country.

I think there's kind of a disconnect between the ""old and new worlds"" in regards to this. While birth tourism is obviously an abuse of the system, I don't think the majority in Jus Soli societies (from Canada to Argentina) would want to get rid of the system. It's kinda how we all started? But for an old world society I'm not sure it'd be a good idea as you've stated. Citizenship means something different perhaps.

&gt; but still get to benefit from all the rights that come with being a citizen of them

Well they also have to pay the costs... the empire demands it's tribute no matter where you reside.

It's a real ironic issue, as Poland has a surprisingly high amount of recovery funds, which were negotiated after the first wave, which didn't really exist in Poland. Spring and summer were life as usual per European standards. The second wave is hitting Poland hard, but... that happened after the negotiations on the package, so it is totally unfair, that countries hit most by wave 1, as in Italy, Spain, France etc can't get their recovery funds, but also makes you wonder why Poland got so much (pre wave 2) when at that point it was barely inflicted by Covid19... and that is on the EU.

Obviously, if either side stopped financing/helping the opposing side, they'd have to start helping their own side, but because they knew the opposing side was helping their side, they continued helping the opposing side.

Over and over and over and over.  

Although economic sanctions will provide solutions in the short term, it will enable people like erdoğan to take the lead in the long term. When we consider what problems people like Erdogan create, these things need to be solved by talking together. I'll tell you before you say it.  Greece or France don't speak, they just shout. . Greece puts an unnecessary ego behind it, trusting the states that gasped it. France wants to play colonization again. If they want so many sanctions, they can do it one by one country-based. When France, Greece and certain European countries impose an embargo, they already do some harm. But there is nothing more stupid than asking other countries to take responsibility for your own interests. The French have been digging Libya under the Italians since 2011. This hurt Italy the most. Why should they do business with you? Why would they impose an embargo on another country for your benefit? Europeans should wake up quickly from this wet dream. Every country defends its own interests and everybody is right in that.

Not that there is anything wrong with making wars against enemies, in that historical period everybody was doing that.

But it is still a big difference - there is nothing like that in the gospels. Or in the New Testament as such. Nothing about mustering cavalry. The Christians don't have any cavalry, and aren't expected to get any and are told don't strive for that kind of stuff.

The Old Testament does have war stuff - Book of Joshua is like a genocide manual. Not strange as the Old Testament supposedly describes the history of the Jews, including all their wars, won and lost.

They could have distributed the food more evenly, for example, which would have saved a lot more lives and not made a Japanese invasion any easier.

The example of the Romanian Greek-catholic church (what a name btw) you bring up is one of them and it’s bishops continued to flip between catholic and Romanian orthodox during the following centuries, often times because of political pressure. They’re existence is the product of Jesuit conversion efforts during the late 17th century though, so that’s an example of a partial integration of former orthodox Christians into Catholicism, while the main Orthodox Church in the region still exists and dominates. 

You also bring forward a good argument for reunification on orthodox terms, but it’s purely theoretical. A nice thought experiment, but reality was so much more complex than just counting patriarchs and declaring the orthodox side as more powerful.

They also intimidate anyone who dares to practice 'wrong think' like journalists reporting about them. They have forced journalists to hand over their press cards (has the journalists home address on it) and then the terror starts or you stop reporting about them.

**Maffia:**

They sure steal property the way the maffia does. Here is how that goes: Occupy a building, don't pay rent but sue the owner for all sorts of damages and services. Keep at it until the owner goes bankrupt then at the foreclosure auction (zwangsversteigerung) nobody will want to bid on the building except for some 'stiftung' controlled by the very people occupying the building. A nice example is  Bödikerstraße 9, 10245 Berlin. They drove the owner into bankruptcy and then acquired the property for ca. 400 p/sqm even though the average area price was over 4000 p/sqm at the time (it is higher now)

There are dozens of buildings like this in berlin. The maffia has been running the same scheme for ages. Antifa/autonomen auf harz4/whatever you want to call them are actually worse because the maffia doesn't sugar coat their crimes with ideological hypocrisy.

Worst of all:  plenty of berlin politicians have their backs. Prime example is the soon to be convicted criminal Florian Schmidt of the green khmer.

The clearest example of grants are those given to research projects without the results needing to become available to the public, the US National Science Foundation laid the foundation of Google like this.


QE is indeed monetary policy, But ultimately it results in redistribution of money from consumers to companies. This is not inherently bad, but it's done in a manner that distorts the market.

I disagree that monopoly is natural in this case, i can see that argument for maybe something like Facebook, but not for search engines (nor PC OSes for that matter, just look at game consoles for an example of a market with more competition). And even then, social media has seen more variety than search engines. Even search has trade offs, even if smaller. None the less, while google outcompeted most search engines that existed when it first arrived it has maintained that position by other strategies. I bet if it wasn't the default search engine on Firefox when it first came out or it's not the default on Android we would not have a monopoly on it in the west. And this is the crux of it, these companies use their monopoly position to strongly favor themselves even in other areas. They build ecosystems that they can take all the best parts of, and any company in their way will be crushed by their monopoly.

2120,"Very interesting, but you thought this process the other way around. It’s probably a problem of environment. While I myself am not catholic, I live in a mainly catholic state.

So what you’re thinking of is a reunification on the terms of the Orthodox Church. What I was describing was a reintegration of eastern churches into Catholicism. Catholicism had no problem with integrating eastern churches one by one, that’s actually where the 23 eastern Catholic Churches come from. While a complete reunification was Catholicism’s goal from around 1450 onward they just took what they could get and were fine with only partial unifications. This happened a lot, until the mid 20th Century. 

If anything though, the progress of integrating Catholicism into orthodoxy is even more complicated and unlikely, since the catholics would have to abandon the idea of the Primat of the Roman bishop, did I get this correct?

The idea of two gods or deistic principles, one good and the other evil, was central to Cathar beliefs.

Cathars believed human spirits were the sexless spirits of angels trapped in the material realm of the evil god, destined to be reincarnated until they achieved salvation through the consolamentum, when they would return to the good god.

He will also likely to take softer stance on China which will make any harder stance against them much harder ensuring current course of things, which in turn means that Uyghur situation will continue, and any kind of response to Chinas moves in regards to border bullying and undermining of HK or Taiwan will be dulled.

I might be wrong but for now looking at his track record as vice president and his statements during his campaign that's what I walk away with. Additionally.

He promised not to support UK in regard to their post-Brexit situation(in direct opposition to Trumps stance) which might affect how much bad blood there's gonna be between UK and EU afterwards since UK will likely get hit harder without support and EU is going quite cutthroat on UK. I'm 50/50 on this, maybe he was just putting himself in opposition to Trump.

Languages don't have to evolve quickly - some do due to internal and/or external forces, but it's technically possible to have a language stagnate.
Maybe Danish and Dutch didn't evolve as much as German.

Also, you have to keep in mind that, the people speaking German in the north have a hard time understanding people speaking German in the south.

But, both the northern and southern dialects are gradually being standardized into a non-northern form of German. I.e. German is developing away.

There used to be a form of Danish in Germany called ""Anglen"" or something - but that disappeared in the early 1900s (afaik it's the place where Angles - as in Anglo-Saxon - - &gt; Anglish - - &gt; English came from originally)

2346,"&gt; Not as bad as Rep of Ireland

What you mean like actively collaborating with the allies?

The Cranbourne report of 1945:

&gt; They have agreed to use by our aircraft based on Lough Erne of a corridor over Southern Irish territory and territorial waters for the purpose of flying out to the Atlantic.

&gt; They have arranged for the immediate transmission to the United Kingdom Representative's Office in Dublin of reports of submarine activity received from their coast watching service.
    
&gt; They arranged for the broadening of reports by their Air observation Corps of aircraft sighted over or approaching Southern Irish territory. (This does not include our aircraft using the corridor referred to in (b) above.)
    
&gt;They arranged for the extinction of trade and business lighting in coastal towns where such lighting was alleged to afford a useful landmark for German aircraft.
 
&gt;They have continued to supply us with meteorological reports.

&gt;They have agreed to the use by our ships and aircraft of two wireless direction-finding stations at Malin Head.

&gt;  They have supplied particulars of German crashed aircraft and personnel crashed or washed ashore or arrested on land.

&gt; They arranged for staff talks on the question of co-operation against a possible German invasion of Southern Ireland, and close contact has since been maintained between the respective military authorities.
 
&gt;They continue to intern all German fighting personnel reaching Southern Ireland. On the other hand, though after protracted negotiations, Allied service personnel are now allowed to depart freely and full assistance is given in recovering damaged aircraft.

&gt; Recently, in connection with the establishment of prisoner of war camps in Northern Ireland, they have agreed to return or at least intern any German prisoners who may escape from Northern Ireland across the border to Southern Ireland.
 
&gt;They have throughout offered no objection to the departure from Southern Ireland of persons wishing to serve in the United Kingdom Forces nor to the journey on leave of such persons to and from Southern Ireland (in plain clothes).

&gt; They have continued to exchange information with our security authorities regarding all aliens (including Germans) in Southern Ireland.

&gt; They have (within the last few days) agreed to our establishing a radar station in Southern Ireland for use against the latest form of submarine activity.

But yeah, De Valera signed a book  **following the usual protocol on the death of a Head of State of a state with a legation in Ireland.**  so I guess none of this matters?

2394,"It's usually not everyday wear.
A good, high quality traditional costume might cost a few hundred euros (or it's a heirloom handled down by generations, making it even more valuable). Most  people definitely only wear it for special occasions. It's also dependent on current fashion, it's as simple as that. A few decades ago barely anybody in Bavaria would wear a traditional dress, it was seen as something that the uneducated, rural peasents would wear, not the modern, sophisticated man of the world. Nowadays, its very common even, or especially, among the youth, and people wear it for more and more occasions, like weddings and all kinds of celebrations, sometimes indeed even as a casual outfit. 
And what do you even mean with ""national music""? Music in our language? Very common, very popular. Traditional music? Differs strongly from region to region, but usually only heard during some kind of traditional festivity. However there are a decent amount of bands mixing traditional and modern elements which are somewhat popular.

2458,"**Analysis**. In the aftermath of the attack on Samuel Paty, when a video surfaced in which an Islamist preacher, Abdelhakim Sefrioui, called for mobilization against the professor, some extreme left-wing activists recognized this face. They remembered the time when they had fallen out with Sefrioui and his companions.

Not without nostalgia, they thought back to the Pro-Palestinian demonstrations during which the order service of this or that anarchist or Trotskyist organization was still vigorous enough to expel from the procession those supporters of jihad linked to the ex-humorist Dieudonné and the radical far right. And then they thought of that pivotal moment, around 2010, when it had to be admitted that the balance of power had changed: on the Parisian pavement, the revolutionary old guard was now too weak to subdue the Islamists.

Algerian hope

But this reversal of balance in the street had a wider significance. It sealed the end of an era, one in which European lefties thought they were so desirable that they could polarize all the anger in the world. As early as 2005, the philosopher Daniel Bensaïd (1946-2010), one of the references of the revolutionary left, noted that the anti-colonialist leaders of the past, those who often claimed to be Marxist, had been replaced by disturbing profiles: ""The time has passed for the liberation struggles of the 1950s and 1960s and their great promises. The leaders are no longer called Ho Chi Minh, Guevara, Cabral, Lumumba, Ben Bella, Ben Barka, Malcolm X, but Bin Laden, Zarkaoui or Mullah Omar. »

One among others, Daniel Bensaïd regretted the great hours of what has been called ""Third Worldism"". In the 1960s, Western revolutionaries realized that the ""grand soir"" (=communist uprising) was long overdue both in the East, where Stalinism was stifling all revolt, and in the West, where capitalism seemed to have more than one trick up its sleeve. They had then placed their hopes in the uprisings of a ""third"" world, of which independent Algeria was the most seductive symbol.

The ""Redfoot"".

In the heart of this country, however, European activists were already aware that things were not so clear. They were called the ""red-footed"". These Frenchmen had supported the National Liberation Front (FLN) in its struggle for independence. Once they had won independence, they had settled in Algeria to help build ""socialism"" there. Soon, they were confronted with a completely different reality: the new regime was Islamizing the country with a forced march, organizing the hunt for Kabyle and homosexuals, and attacking even its most loyal European supporters.

Some of them then realized their mistake: if the FLN had a secular face, it also had another, deeply religious one. The name of its newspaper, El Moudjahid, did not mean ""the fighter,"" as they had believed, but ""the fighter of faith. Banished from Algeria, most of the Red Footed will keep to themselves what they have lived through (they did not want to ""play the game"" of the far-right), and their silence will weigh heavily on the ""Algerian"" memory of the French left.

Years later, in 1980, they read in Le Monde an interview with the former Algerian president, Ben Bella. ""It is Islamism that offers the best chances of a real liberation,"" he will say, even establishing a continuity between the fighting of the FLN and the Islamic revolution that had just triumphed in Iran.

Doubt after the triumph of the mullahs

This revolution marks another stage in the relations between political Islam and the European left. With the triumph of the mullahs, doubt begins to set in: although religion is still considered an ""opium of the people"" that is destined to evaporate, one must concede that its effects are proving to be tenacious. In Tehran, were not the insurgents who defended socialism swept away by those who promised the advent of the divine kingdom? For many on the left, however, this did not make much difference. ""Everything that moves is red,"" said a slogan well known to the sixty-eighters. So Marx would surely win out over Allah in the end.

All this should be borne in mind when opening the booklet entitled The Prophet and the Proletariat. Published in 1994, written by Chris Harman, a figure of British Trotskyism, it analyzes the challenge that Islamism represents for the left. Contrary to what is often asserted about him, Chris Harman does not advocate a systematic alliance with Islamists. Considering them as a sometimes reactionary and sometimes subversive force, he proposes to walk alongside them wherever their actions undermine Western imperialism and the states that serve it. ""With the Islamists sometimes, with the state never,"" he writes.

This formula sums up the enduring credo of part of the European left, a credo based on three articles of faith: 1) there is only one real domination, that exercised by the West; 2) the only force that can end this domination without borders is an internationalist left, which knows the meaning of history; 3) when the dominated rise up in the name of God, one must not judge the ""detour"" they take, because sooner or later they will abandon the chimeras of religion for the truth of emancipation.

There was a historical precedent for this approach. Indeed, leftist activists who saluted the revolutionary potential of Islam often invoked the Latin American experience of the 1960s and 1970s. At that time, Marxist guerrillas had the support of the Christian movement that was called ""liberation theology"": combining the Gospels and class struggle, its leaders called for rebellion, and priests were killed in it. Later on, this companionship will be invoked: if we were able to receive the support of Christian believers, why couldn't we rely on Muslim believers?

Soon, however, a major difference appeared: wherever it made itself comfortable, Islamism crushed the left... Just think of Iran. Or to the ""black decade"" in Algeria (1991-2002), when intellectuals, trade unionists, feminists were slaughtered daily. ""Islamic fundamentalism, as a general rule, has grown on the decaying corpse of the progressive movement,"" notes Lebanese Marxist Gilbert Achcar.

""Islamo-leftism"", a risky label

Even on the ground, however, this corpse still moves. Better yet, it continues to believe itself universally desirable. If ""Islamo-Leftism"" is a hazardous label, too often used to say anything and disqualify anyone, it nevertheless designates something solid. But, rather than a cynical complacency, it names a sin of pride, resting itself on an obsolete belief: because only the left can channel hopes, any struggle that claims to be God's will end up being magnetized by the ideal of social emancipation.

Much more than the clientelist calculations that allow this or that city hall to cling to power, it is this pretension that sheds light on the episodes during which the Left believed it could rub shoulders with Islamism without getting burned: the anti-racist left found itself in the company of Muslim fundamentalists at the summit of Durban, South Africa, in 2001; the alterglobalist left invited Tariq Ramadan to the European Social Forum in Paris, in 2003; the propalestinian left allowed more than one hateful slogan to proliferate in the parades in which the preacher Abdelhakim Sefrioui participated, among others.

Now, as much as it is false to affirm that the mass of left-wing militants and intellectuals have consciously ""bet"" on Islamism as a political force, one can consider that they have long manifested a form of indulgence towards it. Here again, however, this indulgence is first of all a superiority complex.

In the same way that Lenin defined ""leftism"" as the infantile disease of communism, one can affirm that ""Islamo-Leftism"" constitutes the senile disease of Third Worldism. That of a Western-centric left, which does not imagine that oppression can come from elsewhere. That of an anti-imperialist Left that sees in every Islamist a damned of the earth, even when he is laden with diplomas or a millionaire. That of a left that used to place its pride in its world aura, and which has been outclassed by a movement that it has long looked upon from so high up: the Islamist International.",France (Alsace),/r/europe/comments/k1cvdc/the_left_and_islamism_looking_back_on_a_sin_of/gdncx0w/,CaptainLargo,1606386185

Besides that I got friends who testified that their neighbours had close encounters with them as they broken into their homes while they were temporarily away in the mountainous region, and they caught them there when they returned home. Luckily those had no weapons and weren't aggressive, they just quickly fled, but still, they broken in and took what they could find...

2476,"&gt; Orban and Vucic have the same styles of governance, and I can hear the exact same complaints from opposition minded Hungarians, including fixed tenders and secret funding.

Yes it's possible to rig contracts but it is harder. And government corruption is sometimes not about what can be done but how much the government can get away with in front of the public. Keeping things secret or making handpicking companies normal,  raises the bar of public tolerance.  


&gt;Maybe it's a question of degrees, but from the outside looking in, I don't see Vucic having that much trouble in the EU, or that his rule is the reason why we can't join. As much as the EU is being marketed as a solution to our corruption problems, I'm not seeing it.  

It's definitely a question of degrees, I don't think people should look at the EU in a black and white way as either a cure against corruption or completely irrelevant. It helps somewhat. I'm pretty sure if Serbia joined the EU today it would be the most corrupt member and I don't think that's a coincidence or it was always this way. Other countries just managed to make more progress thanks to EU institutions and pressure. What I meant about Vucic as an obstacle is that his government is just not interested in passing the reforms necessary to approve Serbia (they're not even doing the easy ones) and the EU not wanting another Orban could be relevant if Serbia is close enough to overlook some things but doesn't get this ""favour"".


&gt;Of course, Vucic is a populist, and there's really not much to gain by joining the EU since the actual enthusiastic support is limited to a few people on /r/serbia. I'm under the impression that more people would actively oppose joining the EU than would actively support it.  

Yeah it doesn't seem to me like there's much support either. I read once that polling young Serbs in some university  they found out young people are even less supportive of the EU than older ones.  I haven't been able to find that article again. Do you think that's true?

The Public Health Institute writes a report regularly evaluating alcohol use and which steps can be taken to reduce the consumption, weighing pros and cons.

Gambling is heavily restricted.

2613,"This event was turned into a song and traditionally sung by Belgian students all around:

1. Te Gent, de oude stede,
Daar lag het Gravensteen
Sinds eeuwen als vergeten,
Verlaten en alleen.
Tot plots studentenkeerlen,
Belust op leute en lach,
Met list de burcht verov'ren,
Zo zonder stoot of slag.
Keerzang:

Spuiters van Vlaanderen!
Gent brult van pret:
""'t Gravenkasteel door studenten bezet!""
Ze zitten er binnen! wie krijgt z'er uit.
Ze vrezen noch knuppel, noch water, noch spuit!
Belegeraars zo ge ten aanval wilt gaan.
Pas op, pas op, pas op, pas op!
Uilenspiegel, Uilenspiegel voert hen aan!

2. 't Pandoerenheir, zeeghaftig,
Rolt ladders bij de muur,
En neemt met waterlansen,
De ruïne onder vuur.
Maar appels als granaten,
Ontploffen op de grond,
En 't slijmig schroot zaait pletsend,
Verwarring in het rond.

3. 't Studentengild, verbeten
Bedekt met stof en as,
Verschoot zijn laatste appel,
Zijn laatste zode gras.
Toen was hun strijd gestreden…
Maar, door de eeuwen heen,
Zal Vlaadrens lach herdenken,
De slag om 't Gravensteen!",Europe,/r/europe/comments/k0z9vw/proud_of_our_belgian_beer/gdmum5q/,SuperCharlesXYZ,1606371748

2645,"&gt; In which no joke the most ancient university of the country the Katholic University of Leuven had to split in a dutch and french part due to the french suppressing the Dutch speaking students and professors at their own university.

At the time of the split (1968), Dutch was already a fully recognized language of the university and you could have all classes in Dutch OR French if you wanted. There were basically already two universities operating in parallel (although they were still officially the same entity), they just happened to both be in Leuven. The split was a consequence of the creation of the linguistic border in 1962, that put Leuven in the Dutch-speaking region. Following this, flemish nationalists couldn't stand the view of francophone students on *their* side of the border, and violently expelled them.

This event has been heavily romanticized by flemish nationalism, but in reality it was a hostile action without cause. In my opinion, 1968 is the year when flemish nationalism stopped being about trying to achieve equality (flemings were already equal to francophones in all aspects of society by that time), and started being about exclusivity and rejection of the other.

Sure part of the issue is that we lead more sedentary lifestyles nowadays, but let's not fool ourselves here, the main culprit is the food industry. 80-90% of what you find in a grocery store except for basic ingredients is full of crap. It's either that you have the time to prep your every meal from scratch or the money to pay someone else to do it for you, either you eat crap. There's no way around it. And it's not like convenience food couldn't be healthy, or at least healthier than it is right now, it's just that the food industry doesn't give the slightest shit about the long term health effects their food has, they only care about how cheap it is to make and how tasty it is. And how do you make stuff both cheap and tasty? You load it with crappy artificial flavoring and sugar. Lots and lots of sugar. And then you just slap a nutritional label on it and says some stupid shit like ""4 servings"", when in reality you know that it's going to be eaten by one person in one sitting. 

Governments should regulate the amount of sugar and other unhealthy stuff that go into food. For stuff that have to exceed these amounts for obvious reasons (like candy) you can limit the amount that can be sold in one package and also have warning labels like on cigarette packs.

2775,"&gt;Second of all, being offended by someone's identity (gay, black, indigenous, whatever...) is not the same as being offended because somebody insulted you. You obviously disagree, but I'm just not going to entertain that notion. Sorry.

Oh no, I don't think we disagree about that.

What I wanted to point out was that there is a difference between the racist aspects which come along with cultural appropriation, and the aspects of it which are ""merely inconsiderate"".

Selling Bavarian knickers at H&amp;M is merely inconsiderate. You are not perpetuating racist stereotypes, not targeting a group which is still facing discrimination, and which is still suffering from its consequences, historical and present.

While with a ""Sexy Pocahontas""-costume you are doing all of that, and some. That goes well beyond merely inconsiderate.

&gt; If indigenous people tell you it's offensive to wear a sexy Pocahontas costume for halloween (and I think there's a pretty compelling argument that it is), then doing so anyway, especially when you could just as easily dress up differently, is a dick move.

If it's about wearing it, then I would say that it's a dick move mainly because it's more than a bit racist, less so because it has the potential to be hurtful. An example which I find a bit funny would be a scenario where someone wears a Sexy Pocahontas costume in Japan: You are pretty much guaranteed to not meet any Native Americans, and to not offend anyone.

I know, I know, it's an example which is a bit out there, but I think it's really interesting, as it completely divorces the ""racist"" from the ""inconsiderate and hurtful"" aspect of cultural appropriation, which usually are so closely muddled together.

Is it better to wear a Sexy Pocahontas costume in Japan, as opposed to the USA? It's less inconsiderate. No less racist though. For me the racism aspect simply seems to have the much heavier weight here.",,/r/europe/comments/k0pcbq/traditional_gowns_and_braids_of_the_pomak_village/gdmof5f/,Wollff,1606367062

2851,"Ok, so here apply your American culture. What do they have in common? Language, albeit different variants, but close enough we can call it Italian. Shared history, obviously regional and obviously varying influences. But they’ve been in a country together for several hundred years. They’ve had shared influences for thousands of years. More importantly, they both consider themselves Italian at some level, while also having pride in their regional cultures. All of this applies to the guy from Colorado and new Hampshire, there is a shared American culture. None of this American culture is based on being white, it wasn’t created by white people, it’s not maintained by them, it draws influences from its contributing cultures. Exactly like Italian culture can be shaped by a Venetian or Sicilian influence. I’m not even sure how kitsch would apply, nationalism for sure. I think that’s what you meant. But there you go, I’ve answered your example which further proves my point, local and regional cultures exist and can contribute to a larger national culture, in Italy, and in America. But there is no white culture in America. There is are no shared customs or arts or institutions that were created by white Americans and that apply only to white Americans. There’s just not. That’s American. There is black culture in America because of the history of the country.

And the truth is you can't fix racism by telling people how to do their hair when there is a much deeper systemic divide.

But then again, the specifics of racial issues in America are somewhat foreign to me, not as much as not being informed and interested about them, but not being something I can experience first hand. I sympathise with people being offended with a cultural element appropriated from them.

https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/83283/7-photographic-tricks-hoaxes-and-fads-photoshop

&gt; In the late 19th century, European expatriate photographers in Cairo began to offer novelty portraits with the subject posed in a sarcophagus with only his or her face showing. New York World reported in 1899 that every “enterprising” Cairo photographer produced these portraits “for his American patrons,” as “The mummy pictures are considered graceful and appropriate souvenirs of a trip to Egypt to present on returning to the friends at home.” But Americans weren’t the only ones eager for these souvenirs: The Archduke Franz Ferdinand (yes, that Archduke Franz Ferdinand) posed as a mummy during his 1896 trip to Egypt. 
&gt;
&gt; According to British and American media coverage of the trend, photographers in Cairo used actual sarcophagi to create the portraits, “a hole sufficiently large for the face to show through having previously been cut in the richly-decorated monumental case,” reported the Yorkshire Telegraph and Star in 1899. The paper noted, however, that “Ingenious photographers vary the picture by obtaining a photograph of a mummy,” and some likely used prop versions of the cases. Once the trend reached New York—thanks to the influence of a wealthy society lady named Mrs. James P. Kernochan, who popularized the idea in 1899 after a trip to Cairo—photographers would either superimpose the subject’s face onto a photo of the mummy, or pose sitters inside a life-size cutout of a sarcophagus. Models of the sphinx were also popular. 
&gt;
&gt;Mummy pictures trended in two waves, one in the 1890s and one around 1908. The first wave popularized sarcophagus pictures in both Paris and New York, with the New York World reporting that young women were “finding amusement in replying to requests from amorous swains for their photographs by presenting them with a mummy picture. […] The feelings of the lover may be imagined when he is unexpectedly confronted with the features of his beloved enshrouded in the antique habiliments of death.” In 1908, the trend experienced a resurgence in Egypt and London, with young women supporting the fad in Britain as they had in New York a decade earlier. After all, according to The Philadelphia Enquirer, “[T]he coarse lines of the mummy case and the crude hieroglyphics thereon, serve to accentuate the pretty lines of the girl’s face.”",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/k11w2j/franz_ferdinand_as_a_mummy/gdlxw7v/,duisThias,1606350336

3026,"&gt; we wouldn't have a very healthy diet anymore.

That's not really true. Talk to a nutritionist about this.

&gt; Not to mention switching to a fully plant based diet would bring its own issues, plants need land as well.

Yeah, and we already have to grow so many extra plants because that's what we feed to farm animals. If we cut out the middlecow between crops and our stomachs, we'd end up growing far fewer plants on net.

&gt; You're going to have to explain that.

We give so much food to animals that are then inefficiently converted into food for us that we waste far more food than would be necessary to feed the hungry.

&gt; Doubt it. The Netherlands for example is a massive meat producer, and only a very small country which is extremely densily populated. It doesn't require a lot of land.

The deforestation in the Amazon is almost exclusively for ranching. Are you gonna deny climate change next? Tell me the earth is flat? This isn't a disputed fact at all.

&gt; I don't think we breed bats here. The regular pandemics come from China with their questionable food markets.

Measles and small pox came from cows, the 1918 flu and the swine flu from pigs, bird flu from farmed birds, HIV from apes, etc. etc.

&gt; As is the alternative.

Such as? Using less farmland, producing more calories, experiencing fewer pandemics, and cutting carbon emissions are not costs, those are benefits.

I simply said that our modern agricultural practises are not ""raising to survive"" because the edible food and potable water that we use to fuel the meat industry would amount to far more calories, fibre, protein, etc. than the meat industry itself provides. As in, we have to spend more of the things we need to survive than what we get back.

And in fact the resources the industry requires make it much harder for people to survive by contributing to pressures such as water scarcity and (quite often illegal) deforestation.

We're not talking about a black and white situation where the only alternative to the status quo is to eat nuts and twigs, which I assume you assumed I was arguing for, just like how the alternative to not wearing animal fur isn't to spend your whole life naked.

Now some want advanced economies to do more to reach the targets so that emerging economies can do less, and since the EU is an advanced economy it should reduce emissions like the other advanced economies by 2030 compared to 2015. The problem is such a division of responsibility completely ignores the great efforts the EU has already done to lower emissions in the last 30 years, efforts that were not reciprocated by the other advanced economies I mentioned at the beginning.

The distribution of responsibility is a political action, one country can do less if another country does more, the worldwide target can still be reached with very different distributions of responsibility. So there’s no unified or scientific or correct distribution of responsibility based on which to say whether a country is on track or not. The only commitments made under the Paris Agreement are the NDCs, and the EU is not only meeting its NDC, but actually surpassing it, by a lot.

As for nuclear, its share in Europe will inevitably fall, because it cannot compete with renewables, and it is an even worse match if paired with renewables. An 80% renewables - 20% nuclear generating capacity would be incredibly expensive, because the economics of nuclear (already pathetic at full capacity utilisation) completely dive into absurdity if you have to ramp capacity utilisation up and down to match renewables. Some countries in Europe will still have nuclear by 2050 (some rare ones even with increased nuclear share) but most will see a fall in nuclear generating capacity.

Was there not a general agreement regarding the reliability of the 'Uthamnic Codex?

There was a unanimous consensus from every single Muslim living during 'Uthman's time that the contents of his texts were perfectly portraying the preserved Qur‟an. Ali (ra), the Prophet's paternal cousin, son-in-law, major companion and fourth Caliph, assures us that there was a consensus in agreement regarding 'Uthman‟s actions, Ali (ra) said: “By Allah, he did not do what he did 
regarding the Qur‟an, except by agreement 
from us.” (Ibn Hajar Al Asqalani in Fathul Baari, Volume 8, page 634 said that Ibn Abi Dawud collected this statement using an authentic chain of narrators)
The companions of the Prophet (pbuh) all 
eventually agreed with 'Uthman's burning of the manuscripts. Ibn Abi Dawud collected in his al-Masahif, Volume 1, page 45, from Mus'ab bin Sa'd who said:I found overwhelming support for 'Uthman's (compilation) from the people, however it 
surprised them, but none rebuked him for it‟.
(Ibn Kathir quoted it in Fada'il al-Qura'an p. 39 and said that its isnad is sahih.)
German Orientalist Theodor Noldeke said:
when we consider all this, we must regard it as a strong testimony in favor of 'Uthman's 
Qur'an that no party – including that of Ali - repudiated the text formed by Zaid, who was one of the most devoted adherents of 'Uthman and his family…‟ (Nöldeke, Theodor. ""The Qur'an,"" Sketches from Eastern History. Trans. J.S. Black. London: Adam and Charles Black, 1892.)

You're a company, you produce something for 10 and sell it for 20 in France, you want to pay your fair share of tax, you gain 10, you're taxed at 30% on your earnings in France, the net profit will be  7.

Uncle sam  Ireland  inc who paid 20 for it sell it in France for 20, no gain : no tax.

Because of EU stupid rules who allow a company to pay their tax for all the sales in EU in the country of their choice, and the fact than only one country can make sure thoses rules are not changed. There will always be some country  who will practice tax dumping.

3158,"Sorry for the delay, I was very busy and I had to actually take the time to watch what you have sent me.

&gt;Like what you're doing? 

I am not dishonestly representing Islam, I am pointing to and quoting official islamic history. I am not for or against Islam, I am for truth as God is truth, anything that is not truth can't be God or come from God. I will expand on this more further down.

&gt;the playlist (from your other comment

First off, let me share my view on Aphostate Prophet - I do not support his blind anti-islam approach, he is not in a pure search of truth, but in search of discrediting islam. The problem is that the videos you sent me are just like his, but instead of anti, they are blindly pro-islam (and not pro-islam as in pro service in God, but pro medieval books islam)

In some videos I saw valid arguments, but in many there is the usual personal attacks and attempts to discredit and worse - ridiculous mental gymnastics to explain clear mistakes, opposed to simply admitting the truth, for example:

**The splitting of the Moon** \- the quran verse on this is very cryptic and I don't know how clearly it was even conveyed, but the authentic hadith explanation is simply ridiculous when taken in context. There is absolutely no evidence to show that it actually happened as it is described, today we can look at the moon and clearly see such a thing did not happen and no independent sources ever recorded it. But forget all of that... God is willing to split the moon for a few pagans in the desert, but he is not willing to do anything whatsoever for 7 billion people today, when we have the technology for the whole world to undeniably see? Why doesn't he for example install an undestructable touch screen in the Kaaba and in a few others places around the world that make it clear which is the true religion, so as to end all religious strife, warfare, killing and so on...? 

But no, he did it for a few pagans in the desert in a way that nobody recorded it, but he did not do anything when near 1 000 000 muslim circassians were getting slaughtered for their muslim faith or today admist the constant and never ending bloodshed and misery which exists in all muslim states.

The hadith explanation is a pure myth and it does not make sense, the quran verse is very unclear and there is no real evidence for it. They should simply admit this, opposed to doing mental gymnastics to serve medieval myths (which is not serving God)

I won't even get into the many far worse issues with the ""authentic"" hadiths and the way in which they represent Mohammed...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'm not getting you?? With the explanation provided, what about how they are regarded? What are you referring to? 

I will start by saying a few words about myself so that you do not get the wrong idea and think I am an anti-islam or anti-religion zealot.

I live my life in service to god, by pure definition you can say I live a life of Islam as service to god is its literal translation - BUT, not an Islam through a medieval lense, not one from Arabia or Israel or the Roman Empire or whereever. I do not blindly subscribe to the medieval texts all of which clearly do not come from directly from God, but are the work of medieval and pre-medieval men. I read the Quran and when it commands something I use (my god given) ability to reason and search for truth ask the simple question - does this serve God or does this serve a medieval **caliph** and/or the ones that were writing this book? Or in other words is this actually Islam, is this actually commanding service to God or is it commanding service to some human interest?

Many verses pass this line of questioning, but many others fail - the ones that fail are disregarded as medieval human corruption. And I continue my questioning as only through questioning can I get closer to the truth and in turn closer to God.

You asked me ""what about how they are regarded"" -

The book that is the Quran and the ""authentic"" hadiths are regarded and represented as if they are the word of God and the ultimate truth, **but at the same time:**

**Questioning them is forbidden, punished and attacked.** This by itself is ridiculous, if something is the truth, then questioning it will only strengthen your belief. It also implies that God is somehow afraid of questioning, this is even more ridiculous. 

The only ones afraid of questioning are liars and deceivers. A caliph/ruler with an insecure state and rule is afraid of questioning, God is not. The act of forbidding questioning is equal to a confession that these texts or at least parts of them are not from God.

**Nor they or their history is represented clearly to muslims.** The true history and origin of the quran and hadith books is not openly taught and when it is mentioned it is in a heavily sugarcoated manner. Yasir Qadhi dared to admit this, but of course, he was immediately shut down and attacked.

The excuse for this is ""keeping islamic unity""... this ridiculous statement exposes the origin of the corruption of the hadiths and book that has been called the quran. Keeping islamic unity was important for medieval caliphs as they had big empires full of very different people and they needed some means to keep them together under their rule - this is why they put a repressive interpretation of the quran in a book and banned and burned all other records ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91AM7665cbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91AM7665cbo) \- do not listen to their commentary, simply read the sources on the screen

All of this leads muslims today to follow medieval texts opposed to actually following God. The symptoms of this are many - muslims being stuck forever in the middle ages, them being easily manipulated, them being kept in purposful ignorance and on and on...

None of this would exist if Islam was followed and transmitted as Mohammed left it - in the form of a QURAN, literally meaning RECITATION - speech from memory, **not** one book. Mohammed could have written thousands of books, but he did not write or order the writing of any books, he simply gave his revelations to anyone that was willing to listen and these people could then go in their village and communicate it. This format allows for evolution, throughout the years and centuries the exact words would evolve, but the meaning behind them would remain and it would be kept true by questioning. 

But that's not what happened, the third caliph forbade this, made one book by his liking and burned all other records and forbade the communication of the Quran in its true form of recitation, instead forcing everyone to do it by his book - now what has happened more than one thousand years later? Muslims are stuck with the medieval words and have largely lost the true meaning behind them, apart from the a minority of very educated and well meaning individuals who put things into proper contexts like saying the verses against Christians and Jews were about specific people of the time etc...",Europa,/r/europe/comments/jxruci/double_fatal_assault_in_cholet_france_the_man/gdl7362/,dothrakipls,1606335869

&gt;You could even simplify it to this:  
&gt;  
&gt;Outcome: - (-)  
&gt;  
&gt;Compared to surroundings: - (+)  
&gt;  
&gt;Intention: - (?)  
&gt;  
&gt;Just to clarify, because I know this would come up if I don't say this, Intention basically means to me what his inner logic was about the action. For example, if he thought he was doing a necessary evil (even though that may not be true retrospectively, his intentions were good, but if he just hated Japanese people and wanted them all dead, his intentions would be malicious and immoral.)  
&gt;  
&gt;IMO that question mark decides if he is a good person or not, if we were to judge him solely based on this one action. (which I don't think is fair)

Herein lies my trouble with utilitarianism. How do we know that a necessary evil isn't unnecessary? Does FDR deserve to decide that other Americans will suffer based on their ethnicity? Utilitarianism can be utilised by evil people to justify evil acts. ""*It was for the greater good!""* bellows the selfish man who only understands the greater good in terms of what is *good for him.* *""The sacrifice was worth it!""* says the person who sacrificed nothing and gained everything. ""It was right and proper that innocent Americans were locked up in an internment camp in terrible conditions in the desert leading to fatalities and massive suffering and FDR was justified"" says the person who is no danger of being taken to the camps, living in terrible conditions and possibly being exposed to fatal circumstances and wishes to protect FDR's legacy.

As for FDR's legacy, it isn't all bad. Some of it is actually *really really* good. Made to look even better by the resistance he faced at times. Lend-Lease and the New Deal are what comes to mind when discussing FDR as well as the internment camps. Was FDR evil? Undoubtedly. Was FDR good? Yes, too. Was he wholly good? No, he put innocent people in internment camps. Was he wholly evil? No, he helped the Russians defend themselves against the Nazi's and helped the impoverished people of his nation rise in quality of life. Both are valid and one does not erase the other.

A person is almost like a set (S), where each new event adds a new element to the set and their moral standing is the result of a function on the set (S) which creates a new set (T). We can write it as (because I don't know how to use markup):

for element in S:

if element is equal to ""evil"":

Then set T adds an element ""evil""

if element is equal to ""good"":

Then set T adds an element ""good""

If all elements in the set (S) are good then you have a wholly good person, if all element in the set (S) are bad then you have a wholly bad person. Either T=""Good"" or T=""Evil""

If the set contains both good and evil elements, it's probably a real person. T = ""Good"", ""Evil"".

I will say on first glance my thought was, wow, I had no idea anglo-based cultures did their hair this way. I blame this largely on the education system in America- it places a largeee focus on just the pilgrims, freedom, brief exposé on slavery, civil rights, &amp; racism, our presidents, historical moments from the countries birth till present day, and ultimately unfortunately leaves out a lot.

Its also a touchy subject. As a black girl, I was teased for wearing braids, told my hair looked like literal human excrement. Up until very recently, braids on black people were deemed unprofessional &amp; you could be told to not show up to work with them in. So when you see the same style on someone of another race &amp; they’re heralded for it, it causes a moment of pause- like, why is it ok on them, and not on me, when this is something of my culture? 

And largely just because most white Americans don’t wear their hair like this so it’s intriguing to see. Black hair holds braids better due to the natural coil of our hair vs. the typically straight texture white folks have, so it makes sense that they’d stick with styles that work better for them &amp; dont result in knots or traction alopecia.

3349,"&gt;Maybe what H&amp;M is selling makes you sad, or mad, or causes you other uncomfortable feelings. Which is regrettable. But I think that would essentially be *your problem*.

I'm not saying it should be legislated or anything like that. It's still possible to criticize the behaviour. Just like people can go around being dicks in all kinds of ways without consequences. Doesn't mean people can't call them out on it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Just because something offends you, doesn't mean it's wrong to do it. There must be more to cultural appropriation than ""offending someone"" for it to be ethically problematic. The ""offending someone"" part can't be the problem, because it's not inherently bad to offend someone.

If you're offending people for no good reason then that's shitty behaviour. If I call you a dickhead for no reason that's not exactly ethically problematic, but it's still not nice and I should probably not do it for that reason. It's called being considerate of others.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For example, when someone is openly gay, that is almost guaranteed to offend some Evangelicals. Them being offended is their problem though. Nobody else's.

That is not comparible *at all.*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To sum it up: Since (mostly) Caucasian Europeans brutally colonized the North American continent, it would be ethically problematic if H&amp;M sold knock offs of Native American clothing.

The difference between turning Native American and traditional Bavarian clothing into a costume is that there isn't a history of opressing Bavarians, let alone by the same people selling the knockoffs. Nobody murdered Bavarians to steal their land and then build a Walmart on top of it to sell their culture back to them in the form of tacky accessories. If you can't see why that is particularly insensitive, then I can't help you. If you can see that but maintain that it's not your problem, then you are technically correct, but you are also an asshole.",,/r/europe/comments/k0pcbq/traditional_gowns_and_braids_of_the_pomak_village/gdkdanz/,HamsterCautious,1606321243

If it weren't for them, this part of the culture and heritage of Norway would be gone.

The current suits and dresses are in some cases careful recreations of peasant styles that were worn in the region that they represent. In other cases, they are the unchanged styles and patterns that used to be worn by rural people for their ""Sunday best.

The bunader are primarily made in wool, though the shirts are made of linen. They are hand-sewn and hand-embroidered, and very expensive; they tend to be handed down as heirlooms.",,/r/europe/comments/k0suz0/some_bunad_the_traditional_dress_of_norway_each/gdjzu2x/,fruskydekke,1606313997

3558,"The Japanese didn't conquer more land, but in terms on control that includes the oceans, it did control a third of the planet at the height of its rule since it basically controlled damn near the entire Pacific. The Pacific war was where America lost the most lives, but in terms of straight up death, Germany, Russia, China, and Japan lost... A fuck ton. I believe America, Great Britain and France might have lost 250000 each, but Russia lost somewhere near the 20-22 million mark. Russia paid the full price for WW2, and it was a huge bill to pay:( they effectively took all of Nazi Germany's might from 1940-1944. What frustrates me most about history, is that FDR and Stalin understood eachother and got along and had agreements. People forget Russia entered the Pacific theater after the defeat of Germany at the request of FDR a couple years prior, Russia fulfilled that promise. It was when Harry S. Truman was sworn in as president after FDR died that things went off the rails and the cold war was in motion. FDR barely spoke to the man about the war, he met him only once for like an hour at the whitehouse before he passed. Harry S Truman damned the world to deal with a cold war, a military industrial complex, proxy wars, and the smearing of the Soviets in the post war period. Churchill isn't innocent here either, but to think that if FDR lived, we would see the second bill of rights be enacted ratified, giving everyan and woman and child in America, a home to live in, an education, adequate healthcare, and farmers and small businesses freedom to sell their goods in a fair market. Imagine the Soviet Union and America cooperating on the global level. In science, world affairs, space exploration, the world would be so damned different today if that guy could have held on for four more years :( I bet he would have if he hadn't caught polio, but then again, polio is what made him such a visionary for America and the kind of world he wanted to make. FDR and his wife are truly an amazing couple in American history and if anyone wants to learn more about them and his cousin Theodore, please check out Ken Burns series on them. Such a great show to have on to relax in the background during these pandemic times.

Usually the answer is ""Shut up, we pay you EU funds"" or ""it's not our problem"". But anyway, what influence does EU have? Russia can start any wars in Europe, Turkey makes fun of the EU and threatens members states (Cyprus &amp; Greece asked many times for EU to do something), benefit seekers can come from any place around the world and EU can not deport them back to their countries, because those countries don't even want their own back. Leaders have to say ""everyone is welcome"" because they don't have the power to stop it and they don't want to look weak so they pretend that it's their intended policy.

This is the part where someone replies that ""we need more integration to have power"", which means to lose more sovereignty - aka Hans or Pierre tells 27 countries what to do to benefit Germany or France. Yeah, we don't need to lose our independence, we need leaders that can tell outside world ""to do as they're told"" and make an example out of few of them, then EU will have influence.

3592,"&gt; The allies were losing on every front in every theater of war before the US entered the conflict. It was the US joining that caused it to end the way it did and when it did.

TIL: The US military successfully defended Stalingrad to stop the Nazi advances.

&gt; You need to literally look up the literal definition of literally.

Maybe you need to actually look up the history of the war. If it wasn't for Imperial Japan attacking Pearl Harbor, then the US would very likely have continued to sit out the war, while profiteering from lending money and selling resources to all involved parties.

&gt; The US didn't enter the war until it had a constitutional basis for doing so. 

What ""constitutional basis"" did the US have for invading Vietnam? 

&gt; Also it's funny how the Soviets entered the war ON THE SIDE OF THE NAZIS, and only fought against the Germans for a short time before the US got involved

The irony of you trying to make this point under a submission where the US, UK, and Soviets sit on one and the same table as allies. If the Soviets were so evil and such allies of the Nazis, then why did [the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease#US_deliveries_to_the_Soviet_Union) give them resources, weapons, and money? 

&gt; The US is not a subject of European powers. The US had no obligation. We rightfully could have sat out of the fight in Europe entirely and only focused on the Japanese.

So from ""No constitutional basis!"" to ""We are not subject of European powers!"" when nobody ever even implied anything like that. What I take issue with is your r/ShitAmericansSay style ""The US singlehandedly won WWII!"" glory-hogging BS that belittles the sacrifices of literally **millions** of non-Americans as if they never ever happened and didn't have any influence at all on the ultimate outcome of the war.

Personnally I think the big problem is not the law itself, but rather the evolution of the practices of the police when it comes to law enforcement in demonstration situations. In other words, no matter the outcome of the legislative process, the problem remains until there is an effort by the governemnent to change its stance on police violence and responsability.

We have the same problem about laws being needed quickly as you guys in Italy, this ""Global Security Law"" is the product of the recent emotion and terrorist attacks, the governement feels pressured to show off its action by passing a new security law.

But trying to legislate from a position of emotion is never good, the discourse on the subject is hysterical right now. 

This has been a recurring problem in the recent years : each time a terrorist attack happens, a new law is drafted in reaction to it, and no one bothers to ask when does this stop, if the legislator should take time away from current events to assess the situation and legislate from a position of calm and clarity.",,/r/europe/comments/k0o622/french_lawmakers_pass_bill_that_restricts/gdjq8tv/,PrivateGG,1606307092

But lets take something completely oversaturated like law. Something like around 46% of all students in the Netherlands are going for a law-degree. While something like 70% of graduates never going to get a job fitting that degree. Even there the skew is 60%+ in favor of women.

What I've seen in our uni was that women got ""lured in/recruited"" to engineering paths with scholarships and all kinds of programs to get more women in.

He wanted to get rid of low prices of crops by paying farmers to not produce. So, the prices of crops rose and the US ended up having to import food and produce to make up for the things he was paying farmers to not make. This literally happened. Farmers liked it cuz they were being paid to not work, while millions of Americans were starving. 

High wages also fucked people over, like what's slowly happening now. Low skilled workers couldn't get jobs so now they're unable to buy the expensive ass food and material.

That has nothing to do with the theoretical framework of critical race theory. You're talking about individual, shitty studies.

3929,"Stalin went around killing people on the basis of political ideology and class. He wasn't killing Kulaks because he believed that Kulaks were born with Kulak DNA and belonged to the Kulak race. I still find his collectivisation policies to be disasters and horrifying, but it's nothing like the Holocaust in terms of its underlying aims and results. In Nazi Europe, you were born into categories that determined life and death. A Jew was a Jew, no matter what your political leanings or your economic situation was. Poor Jews, Rich Jews, Right Wing Jews, Leftist Jew, Apolitical Jew, etc. all got the gas chamber. Under Stalin, you'd get shot (or ice picked) for having politics that differed from his, but at least you and your entire race wouldn't have a permanent death sentence on your head just by existing.

Kazakhs, Armenians, Georgians, Uzbeks, Jews, etc. could live in the USSR without fear of the gas chamber, and at least the Communist Party preached racial equality (even if in practice, East Slavs dominated the Union politically for the most part). Stalin's endgame in Ukraine was collectivised farms and a secure grip over the place, not exterminating the entire nation. The Nazi endgame was the literal extinction of the population.


This isn't to whitewash Stalin or absolve him of any wrongdoing, I think the guy was a wretch and his purges are horror stories to read about, but I'd say there are varying levels of evil that warrant different reactions from the powers of the world. For instance, Saddam Hussein was also pretty fucking bad, but I wouldn't say the Iraq War was ""worth it"". Plunging the world into World War Three just to overthrow Stalin, when it had barely recovered from WW2, would probably not be worth the additional tens of millions of deaths and trauma.

Truman was initially optimistic too... but despite the US-Soviet cooperation against Nazi Germany during WW2 and America’s initial optimism that the relationship could continue, by 1947 it had become apparent that Stalin and the Politburo were not only mistrustful of the US but also intent on expanding communism even by force, and eventually bringing Soviet Communism to triumph over American capitalism. 

In response, Truman’s National Security Council developed a policy (NSC68) to bring the Kremlin to the point of modifying its behavior to conform to generally accepted international standards.",,/r/europe/comments/k0e9nz/roosevelt_and_stalin_attending_churchills/gditmc5/,GreyhoundsAreFast,1606278858
3944,"&gt;Beyond that, it is a big assumption to assume FDR would not have used nukes.

People's perception of the decision to deploy nukes is *massively* skewed by hindsight. They weren't viewed back then as the literal doomsday machines they are regarded as now. Sure, they'd been tested and studied enough by 1945 that the decision-makers knew how powerful they were, how indiscriminate and horrific in their effects. The long-term effects of things like radioactive fallout weren't fully grasped, but they knew enough.

But by that stage the allies had carpet-bombed most of Europe. FDR was used to condemning hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians to fiery death with the stoke of a pen. Flattening a city took a lot of work and resources, though. Nukes were just a natural extension of existing weapons technology - the next logical step, a linear escalation. A more compact, swift and efficient delivery system for blanket mass destruction. Beyond the horror of the slaughter and fact that it was a wholly novel weapon system (with all the unknowns and strategic ramifications that come with that), I doubt its use would have seemed any more momentous in context than, say, signing-off on the firebombing of Tokyo.",,/r/europe/comments/k0e9nz/roosevelt_and_stalin_attending_churchills/gditq74/,Drunky_McStumble,1606278927

The party of the president has to control the parliament, is that the case then he becomes something like democratic dictator. (he is often called like that among political scientists) 

In this scenario (which has been the case very often) the president has de facto the control of the parliament because the prime minister is nothing else than a puppet of the president.

And if the prime minister gets too powerful or isnt willing to do what the president wants, then he has to retire-macron did that a few months ago with his prime minister - because again, the president is usually also the leader of his party and when the prime minister doesnt want to retire his party can simply start a vote of no confidence.

So yeah in this scenario the president is simply too powerfull because defacto checks and balances doesnt work properly anymore.

This much is obviously true. That's because, like most people, he was a person, and persons are very complicated.

The rest I think I don't agree that it proves the point. Only in Yugoslavia did the communist leadership not follow the Soviet line, and there were real efforts made (the Duclos letter, for example) to ensure that the western european Communist Parties didn't take too independent a line, even in opposition. 

Stalin seems to have sincerely believed that deviation from his line would undermine communism globally. That might even have been true, but we see it most starkly in the assassinations he ordered of independent Communist leaders like Nin, Trotsky, and Tito (who famously survived and threatened retaliation).",,/r/europe/comments/k0e9nz/roosevelt_and_stalin_attending_churchills/gdih0eb/,Frklft,1606271437

He only implied if a POTUS more moderate towards communism was elected, the Cold War might have been less about endless arms race and more of an economic arms wrestling between communism and capitalism.

Truman laid down the foundation of the policies known as the ""Truman doctrine"". If the Red Scare was not that intense in American politics and society, we might see a larger hippie movement and a more liberalized American society that is not afraid to flirt with socialist ideas.

The nuclear arms race was just a facet of the immense conflict between two worldviews that are not inherently opposed to each other (see: Roosevelt presidency and its policies), but rather as communism spread in the third world, the US politicians felt a need to become the complete antithesis of that to cement their power and standing in domestic and global politics.",,/r/europe/comments/k0e9nz/roosevelt_and_stalin_attending_churchills/gdi2l8i/,TheOnlyFuhrer,1606263518

4119,"&gt;They launched a terrorist campaign wherein they were always out matched by the enemy. This didnt changed under tatcher. 

That doesn't mean it wasn't on the IRA's terms, they mostly picked and chose where to fight. 

&gt;Except there was no long term. The conflict less than a decade after tatcher. Once governments realising negotiating was the better option.

The long war was coined by the IRA, it was a failure as their primary objective was to eject the British government from NI by force of arms, which they failed to achieve. 

&gt;??? You just listed IRA atrocities. That doesnt change the fact that her actions caused a greater boost in IRA support than anything but bloody sunday. What influences the British government has nothing to do with that.

Those atrocities reinforced the British intransigence when it came to situations with Bobby Sands, so you can say all you want about how the British boosted IRA recruitment, but IRA terrorism did nothing to assuage the British from giving them a hard time. 

&gt;My arguement isnt that the IRA were good guys fighting the british government(they were instead murderers and crooks). My arguement is that Thatchers actions helped the IRA.

And my argument is that it wouldn't have mattered anyway as the IRA were already radicalising the Catholic population against the British government. 

&gt;Except unionist also changed there tone wich was definitely not because of tatcher. In the 70s they had prevented the sunigale agreement. 

That's irrelevant because NI wasn't incorporated into ROI, which was the primary aim of the IRA

&gt;Negotiations was caused by people being tired of the conflict. Not the IRA thinking they could no longer win. And it happened after tatcher.

No, it was caused by people being tired of the conflict, US pressure, UK pressure, ROI pressure and the British security forces dismantling IRA networks in NI and the IRA leadership being unable to bring about their objectives through violence, which was the ejection of British government in NI. 

&gt;Tatcher actions simply did not work and only made the conflict worse. It only started getting better after she left. They year she left office the amount of attacks started to decrease after having being increasing since she took charge.

Thatcher brought about the Anglo Irish agreement in 1985, through Unionist and Republican opposition. She ratcheted up the pressure on the IRA and kept them on the backfoot all the way through her premiership which then gave an opening for an alternative route for Irish nationalist aspirations in NI through the guise of Sinn Fein, which took over and increasingly gained prominence.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/k02o2v/margaret_thatcher/gdi2p6p/,DrPepperThanks,1606263577

4134,"That's because of the 'pure evil' narrative. You only hear about such people (who 'accidentally' just so happen to be on the losing side) as some maniacs. Hitler was celebrated in Germany and for the majority of his reign he was seen as a liberator. Stalin wasn't as popular in the USSR but only those with opposing ideologies saw him the way he's interpreted now in the West (as in simply evil). All of them were people with ideals and dreams who genuinely thought they were the good guys and making the world a better place. Now, who says the 'liberators' and 'good guys' of today aren't the same? We have to look at any such 'saviour' figure with extreme caution and skepticism. Today they propose democracy, liberty, power to the people, human rights etc. but in 10 or 20 years...

This narrative is being pushed by Republika Srpska, the Croats in Bosnia and Croatia itself. Obviously the official narrative that Muslims were slaughtered on mass by 'Christian Europeans' no longer fits the agenda and narrative they now seek to push. 

It was only last year that it was revealed that the Croatian secret service was attempting to bait Bosnjaks in Bosnia into buying illegal weapons in the hope they would commit terrorist acts.

I am not about to defend the man, as I never studied him specifically. But I do know he was horrified to learn of the treatment of the jews.

The wiki summary;

&gt;When the soldiers of the 4th Armored Division entered the camp, they discovered piles of bodies, some covered with lime, and others partially incinerated on pyres. The ghastly nature of their discovery led General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe, to visit the camp on April 12, with Generals George S. Patton and Omar Bradley. After his visit, Eisenhower cabled General George C. Marshall, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, describing his trip to Ohrdruf:[2]

&gt;... the most interesting—although horrible—sight that I encountered during the trip was a visit to a German internment camp near Gotha. The things I saw beggar description. While I was touring the camp I encountered three men who had been inmates and by one ruse or another had made their escape. I interviewed them through an interpreter. The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick. In one room, where they were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. He said that he would get sick if he did so. I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to 'propaganda.'

4197,"The point is to take objective responsibility for our histories. To not make excuses for the criminals of the past. If we keep running the whole ""Japanese Internment Camps were ok actually"" narrative then we're going to end up with more internment camps (\*cough\* separated border children) because we're normalising them.

We shouldn't normalise criminal behaviour just because there is a worse criminal and we shouldn't normalise criminal behaviour because they are carrying *our* flag.

A tragedy is a tragedy and to measure it before giving it the respect it deserves to see ""if it's a big enough of a number to care about"" sets us in a precarious morale position where human life is reduced to a digit. Is 100 deaths too little to care about? Do we need to reach 1000 deaths before we can call it a tragedy? Or is it a case of :

If you are my enemy and you kill 1 person then it is tragedy and a crime and you will hear about for all of time.

If you are my ally and you kill 100 people then clearly it was necessary so lets not treat it like a tragedy and instead play it off like sacrificing the lives of other human beings is fine and just sweep it under the rug,  never to learn a single thing.

Several hundred died in the camps, several hundred living, feeling, human beings like you and I and each one was a tragedy in their own right. Scared, torn away from their homes and their friends and family, malnourished and mistreated and brutalised. Treated like a POW by your fellow citizens just for having Japanese ancestry. I'm not a fan of sweeping horrendous bullshit like this under the rug because there was a worse massacre elsewhere.

Because at that point it just becomes a zero sum game: only the greatest loss of life matters and everybody can just shut up *cause they don't have it so bad.*

Because it is their private property and by not having them renting it out they are wasting cash that is THEIR.People invest in housing construction to make money as they put their money at risk anticipating demand also being a landlord is hardly profitable given the return on capital and government intervention would vanish housing investment from private sector if price controls are implemented.

Housing nowadays is much less of an issue than in times of communism when we had no ""greedy crooked landlords"" but i guess you want to go back to lines for rationed butter and toilet paper as everyone will live in destitute poverty unlike now that someone can have ""more than 10 apartments"" so you hate them",Europe,/r/europe/comments/k0azcu/eu_parliament_has_adopted_a_resolution_to_end/gdhpybe/,Lox-droplet,1606256831

&gt;Soviet Union would say ""if you want to profit from certain advantages like peace with us, prepare to make some concessions"". Quite similar approach isn't it?

This is completely absurd. The EU asking its members to adhere to its values and trade benefits being connected to a membership aren't even in the same ballpark as threats of the Soviet Union like that. They're not even the same sport. Any comparison like that is completely ludicrous and only serves to diminish the horrific acts of the Soviet Union.

&gt; When people compare EU with soviet union they typically mean similar approach of using mass/scale to put pressure on someone

You mean asking its member state to keep to the rules they swore to uphold when they joined? If people equate the connecting of budget with rule of law to pressuring its states into submission, then they just reveal their own ignorance and indifference toward the rules of the Union.

&gt; And EU was created to be big and to use its mass as a weapon/tool of pressure.

It was created to be big, yes, as a trade and later as an ever closer union. But to have a voice in the world among the other big players, not for using that mass as a weapon toward its members.

4414,"My point is that focusing on ""renewable energy"", which excludes one of the best source of low-carbon energy so far, right behind hydro, is irrelevant to the issue of climate change, which is ultimately what their deployment aims to tackle.

It's like saying that we need more intermittent energy, just because wind and solar happen to be intermittent. We don't need intermittent energy, nor do we have a particular need for non-renewable systems that harvest renewable sources of energy. What we need is low-carbon energy.

It's not about being pedantic, it's about using the right words, because using the wrong ones have consequences. Setting ""renewable deployment goals"" to ""tackle climate change"" implies that it's the renewable part that is good for the climate, not the fact that they're low-carbon. And so people who aren't particularly scientifically literate end up believing that anything not renewable is bad for the climate.

It's not a personal attack, Turk Cypriots are Turks, so hence why I mentioned it.

The IRA ran bombing campaigns and assasinations of MP's and prominent members of British society, I'm not going to apologise for supporting a hardline against them. 

Also Kemalism promoted the idea of Turkishness and one singular Turkish identity at the expense of the Kurdish one, so you do in fact, support Turkish government policies.

It would be interesting to know how fast it is to plan and build a modern nuclear plant in Europe or the US compared to installing a comparable renewable farm.

4540,"University has shifted from being a place for critical thinking and new ideas, to essentially a consumer product catering to the lowest common denominator where just about everyone in society is entitled to, and perhaps even has a right to, a degree. All that one must do is diligently copy down the notes from the professor, and repeat these on a test or essay. No new ideas, and no significant challenges to the students themselves nor to the system. Even student activism nowadays aligns with global corporate interests, e.g. LGBT and Islamic refugee campus activists have basically the same politics as McDonald's, Google and various banks. This is the exact opposite of how campus activists used to be. To be clear, I'm not in favour of Marxists and their ideas, but in fairness, they wanted a societal change that at least didn't align with corporations who change their logo to a rainbow for one month of the year, but I digress.

Why is this? Well, the critical thinkers are still at university, but their share of the student population has plummeted, and they're now surrounded by a hoard of midwits. Of course, highly intelligent women and men alike excel in rigorous disciplines (sciences, medicine, engineering, computer science, mathematics, economics and so on) and some even go on to graduate school (masters or PhD), but concerning the ""easier"" subjects like psychology and other barista degrees, the present system highly favours average intelligence women who are able to sit quietly, copy the notes, and regurgitate them on the final test, but not much else. Similar tier men tend to take education programmes found outside the university, such as skilled trades.

Thus, many or even most of the people being ""produced"" by universities end up having useless degrees, but they undergo a process whereby the university system hones their skills in not questioning anything while simultaneously making this crowd feel quite enlightened. These people diligently do what they are told by corporate interests via incessant advertising, mainstream politicians pushing anti-European policies (""You wouldn't want to be like those *uneducated* racists, would you?""), and of course, at their job that is completely unrelated to their field of study.",,/r/europe/comments/k011tp/women_left_and_men_right_ages_2564_with_tertiary/gdgfexd/,JT_Cdn_Clt_Prc_Htlne,1606234919

Most that join up think the horrible acts of ISIS are just Western propaganda and that there it's basically all rainbows and sunshine.

So once there they realize: the West was fucking right all along.

But in for a Penny, in for a Pound, they usually lack the opportunity to leave. Especially since foreigners are treated as throw-away cannon-fodder. And since going back meant imprisonment, too... or ISIS catches them trying to run away and tortures and executes them.

Not saying this excuses any of their actions but a lot of them... didn't fully realize what they were in for until it was too late. Especially that once in Syria, you likely start agreeing with the cruelty unironically as to cope with your experiences.

But it's also impossible to tell to which camp returners belong to... sleeper agents? Or deserters? Either way, both groups need to be brought to justice.

4598,"Some were uneconomic - others were marginal - a few were profitable. When she got into power the miners were a major political force - and a strong voice in the Labour party which she had just defeated.

Some industries are protected because they are in the national interest - and mining had been treated as essential because of this - Thatcher's reasoning was that coal could simply be bought abroad and that they should survive on financial merits - the minors basically tried to force her to back down and it became a bitter financial, political and cultural battleground.

The end result was both that the uneconomic mines shut and because many marginal mines were out of action they also shut (mines require constant maintenance to keep running)

The mining industry was certainly going to contract - but the miners losing the battle and Thatcher treating them as political enemies afterwards left regions financially destroyed - uncoincidentally these were labour strongholds.

Certainly it was in part a fate they brought on themselves, but she also treated part of her own country as an enemy to be defeated and even her supporters would probably agree she treated the areas which lost badly.

It's behind a paywall, so I can't read it. All I can see is that it's for the period 2010-2015. What was the nature of the intrusions? The agency responsible for keeping track of it does not have the data available online.

&gt; Now in General. It may be translation difficulties, but most of your arguments are 1) This is a different matter. 2) Russian is not allowed. Well, as if so-so arguments.

1. Yes, countries you trust, and countries you don't trust, are not treated the same way. This should not be a surprise. After all, trust is earned. 
2. Russia is not allowed, and Russia has no excuse. The US also does not have an excuse.

&gt; You don't understand. Here in English, I'm talking about this ""NATO Rejects Russian Air-Safety Proposal for Planes in the Baltic Region""

From the title it doesn't seem to has anything to do with Sweden as we are not in NATO, and it is not about Russia using transponders, but about everyone using them. Again, nothing is preventing Russia from using transponders (except the fact that their planes until recently weren't even equipped with transponders). I say, from the title, because this too is behind a paywall. There have been complaints about Russian planes flying without transponders for years, and this was four years ago. Am I to assume that they use transponders now?

4680," Because both of them have the same problem.

Hydro reshapes the environment in ways we cannot comprehend.

Small scale it changes the ecosystem that you can see and large scale in a climate change scenario most hydroplants are non sustainable, therefore you are pretty much destroying the environment for a resource that will be depleted.

Nuclear waste is non renewable for obvious reasons

1) source
2)waste 
You have no environmentaly safe way to get an unlimited amount of nuclear energy because the source is finite and limited , also the waste you have has the best environmental process of disposal being launching them into space 



That aside in my experience renewable sources have the problem of reliability which has not been solved yet. That is why hydro is there to act as a safeguard against high demand while your fossil ones cannot start creating energy so fast. 

The other case of hydro is china making the world's biggest  [hydroplant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam) seems to be facing several issues. Nowadays it is thought that making more hydro energy is not a sustainable solution therefore we should focus on other means.

1. Practically abandon southern Europe. Let them deal with the situation on their own until they collapse under the strain. This is undesirable form the German perspective, because the integrity of the EEC is crucial to the German economy. Southern Europe is an important export market.
2. Commit unspeakable atrocities at the border to scare away potential immigrants. This would lead to a huge uproar and civil unrest from much of the population, not only in Germany but all over Europe. It would also harm international relations.
3. Let people in. But try to control it. Disperse the immigrants as much as possible and try to integrate them into your society.

The article might have some issues. 
Nevertheless it is the only source any of us has given and it clearly states that walhaz derives from the name of a particular tribe known by the romans as Volcae who seems to have bordered the germans. From this the germans started to generaly call all speakers of romance languages walhaz, wales, wallon, etc.

In Romania the explanation for the name Wallahia (principality that is now part of greater Romania) is that this was a name given by the Slavs to the romance speakers. They (the slavs) took the terminology from the germans. Which is consistent with the wiki article and it makes me think it is not that far of course. 

I also know that for the greeks, barbarians were not mearly the non greek speakers but all people who were culturaly different from the hellenistic world, for a long time they called the macedonians barbarians although they were greek speakers... So barbarian for greeks and walhaz for the germans were similar but not identical terms.

5137,"&gt;Capitalism is when individuals can trade freely and engage in free commerce

No, capitalism is when the means of production and enterprise are operated privately rather than by the state. The state can still intervene to promote capitalist policies.

&gt;And no, government intervention is still anti-capitalist if it favors some specific companies — it may be corporatist, but it is not capitalist.

Look up the definition of capitalism and then look up the definition of corporatism. Free-market capitalism is only one variation of capitalism. There are or were protectionist capitalists aswell. 

Largely nowadays the vast majority of capitalist debate revolves around support of the free-market but at that time it wasnt necessarily so. But even nowadays Republican rhetoric in the US has espoused a large amount of protectionism.

5147,"&gt; No, capitalism is when the means of production and enterprise are operated privately rather than by the state. The state can still intervene to promote capitalist policies.

Okay, let me correct my statement. 

“A **free market** exists when individuals can trade freely and engage in free commerce.”

Even corporatist or protectionist policies are better than communism or socialism, but only free markets are a solution for all of our economic needs and desires, and only free markets can ensure a functioning market in all situations, from Ireland to Bengal to the US. From communism to state capitalism to corporatism, all ideologies that revolve around state control of the economy will indeed run into issues in situations like the Irish famine — but it is free market capitalism that allows for the remedy of such situations.

&gt; Look up the definition of capitalism and then look up the definition of corporatism. Free-market capitalism is only one variation of capitalism. There are or were protectionist capitalists aswell.

&gt; Largely nowadays the vast majority of capitalist debate revolves around support of the free-market but at that time it wasnt necessarily so. But even nowadays Republican rhetoric in the US has espoused a large amount of protectionism.

No, not really — most Republicans in the US still endorse free trade. But as a US Republican, even if the party did long term shift forwards protectionism, how would that rebut any of my previous points? Even by the most generous reading of your arguments, you *agree* with me that it’s not *capitalism’s* fault re: the Irish famine — but instead, at most, corporatist or protectionist policies.",,/r/europe/comments/jzkepk/starved_victims_from_the_holodomor_which_killed/gdesk4n/,DexterAamo,1606193658

5150,"1. Policies that block private owners from operating their property for profit (within reason) are anti capitalist. Tariffs block private owners from selling their goods abroad. They are hence anti capitalist. That doesn’t mean that one can’t be a protectionist or a corporatist and still a capitalist, only that what differences may exist between those two ideologies and free markets are anti-capitalist. 

2. No, not really.

3. Left wing and right wing are subjective terms. In Medieval Europe, it was considered radically left wing to advocate for the separation of church and state. In Soviet Russia, it was considered radically right wing to advocate for the privatization of state enterprises. I don’t care for labels — maybe once free market capitalism and constitutional republic with checks and balances was left of center, maybe today it’s right of center. What matters most irregardless is pursing policies that are **right** — and that means pursuing economically free market and socially conservative values.

I always really did. That's why I asked. Should it be banned? Answer being no. In a perfect system there needs to be a mixture of left and right wing policies. 

Protectionist and corporatist policies aren't inherent to any one system either. Both strongly feature in fascism and protectionism is a staple of communism. 

Blind adherence to ideology leads to death. The main reason so many died in the famine was two fold. 1. The British just didn't care how many were dying and saw it as an opportunity to wipe out potential rebellion. 2.

Yes, it's less efficient... But negligibly so, you're adding less than a fraction of a percent to your total daily electrical usage. It's just a disingenuous claim. Even at the extremes I use a qi solar powered charger when backpacking without problems...

With regards to speed, I put a QI adapter on my 13"" ipad and it's always charged in the morning. I don't get people who complain about charging speed, charging fast just ruins your battery... as long as it reaches 100% overnight, it's perfect. Any faster and it wears out your battery requiring replacement. My batteries last 5+ years now ever since using wireless.

It's great. I just toss my device into it's cradle and it charges. Literally toss, I can do it when piss drunk. It charges faster than I can possibly use the charge, so even when using my phone on GPS with full brightness I'm charging.

I just don't understand who has used wireless charging and still advocates for usb. It's great. It's 1 less component to worry about ever wearing out. I've had phones break from 2 causes: cracked screen and bad charging port.

Seriously, qi charging is great. Don't listen to the haters, all the complaints I've ever seen are splitting hairs and ignoring the bigger picture.

The 1848 revolt had nothing to do with Bucharest. Nor with Orthodoxy.  It has to do with magyar nationalism, They wanted Transylvania for themselves. The whole was actually a contrarevolution from Romanians. In the Cluj Dieta, Romanians were severly underrepresented although they were the majority in the land. 3 seats, 24 for Saxons, the rest about 230 for Hungarians. The decision was resented by both Romanians and Saxons and not agreed upon by Austria. Vienna was not hostile to the creation of romanian administrative offices. You can guess Hungary was.
  
The Magyars organised an army. They targeted Romanians, Magyars and Saxons that were still pro-Habsburgs. 
Wiener Zeitung counts 4425 Romanian killed without trial by military tribunals apart from those that died in open fighting. It's estimated that about 40.000 Romanians were killed but no stats to provide. Can you guess who the kept the books? It was the Magyar nobility and intellectuals that followed an agenda, not the Romanians. Even your national poet Sándor Petőfi stood up against the idea of uniting Transylvania and Hungary. 
 The tensions escalated from an armistice that the Hungarians failed to respect. They were the ones entitled to be armed and they began shooting. You know the rest but you know only the numbers that the ones that kept the books want you to know.

Fucking hell, quote the pertinent parts. Like this:

&gt;Marx wrote in his Critique of the Gotha Program, ""between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat"".

#

&gt;While Marxists propose replacing the bourgeois state with a proletarian semi-state through revolution (dictatorship of the proletariat), which would eventually wither away, anarchists warn that the state must be abolished along with capitalism. Nonetheless, the desired end results, a stateless, communal society, are the same.

The predominant issue in the case of the irish famine though, wasn't the concept of the ""free market"" but rather the lack of welfare provided to the starving people. The Whigs used it as an excuse to cut down necessary welfare provisions. I'd argue them not closing the ports was pure ignorance of market externalities, and was 100% a fetishization of the free market/capitalism though, but to say the famine was entirely predicated on it is a stretch imo.

I have friends with very different political ideas, we can discuss politics, but we know where end the political ideas and where start the personal attacks. We do not consider  hurting someone's feeling to be a win in a discussion. Of course you will find assholes, but as far as I am concerned, I ditch the assholes from my personal circle.  I prefer to have a smaller but better circle of friends than just having a lot of friends who are, actually, not real friends. 
We of course have people who are into these conspiracy theories, we have antivaxers, we have people believing in a superior world order, like the illuminatis, we have anti 5G people, we have people believing that the whole covid thing is a master plan to inject us a microchip with the vaccine to control us, we even have a handful of flatearthers. But I believe that overall, they are less numerous, or maybe less vocal than in the US. 
Until now, we have succeeded in avoiding to elect dangerous people at the presidency, keeping fingers crossed, but we do have  threats for our democracy, in the form of extremist parties, which do not give a lot of assurance that they will respect the democratic game: Far right Rassemblement National party (led by Marine Le Pen), and far left France Insoumise party, led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon. 
Recent islamic attacks in France favor the far right party rethorics, it 's like honey to them. This is, to me, a real danger for our democracy.

&gt; The use of the 7 to 20 million figures has been criticized by historians [Timothy D. Snyder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_D._Snyder) and [Stephen G. Wheatcroft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_G._Wheatcroft).  Snyder wrote: ""President Viktor Yushchenko does his country a grave  disservice by claiming ten million deaths, thus exaggerating the number  of Ukrainians killed by a factor of three; but it is true that the  famine in Ukraine of 1932–1933 was a result of purposeful political  decisions, and killed about three million people.  Wheatcroft wrote: ""I find it regrettable that Stephen Harper and other  leading Western politicians are continuing to use such exaggerated  figures for Ukrainian famine mortality"" and ""\[t\]here is absolutely no  basis for accepting a figure of 10 million Ukrainians dying as a result  of the famine of 1932–33. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; A 2002 calculation that uses demographic data, including those recently  unclassified, narrows the losses to about 3.2 million or, allowing for  the lack of precise data, 3 million to 3.5 million.  Soviet archives show that excess deaths in Ukraine in 1932–1933 numbered  a minimum of 1.8 million (2.7 including birth losses). This source  further states ""Depending upon the estimations made concerning  unregistered mortality and natality, these figures could be increased to  a level of 2.8 million to a maximum of 4.8 million excess deaths.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; A 2002 study by Vallin et al. utilising some similar primary sources to Kulchytsky, and performing an  analysis with more sophisticated demographic tools with forward  projection of expected growth from the 1926 census and backward  projection from the 1939 census estimates the number of direct deaths  for 1933 as 2.582 million.

5386,"In my experience that is simply not true, in the decade I spent working retail security only a handful of the hundreds of Romanians I caught shoplifting were unable to read and comprehend the banning notices we had translated. What is true however is pretty much I've ever had a conversation with decent hardworking Romanians about the shoplifting problem they've told me it's just stupid people who can't read or have made a slur about gypsies.

While the majority of Romanians are decent hardworking people there are a disproportionate amount of them living in western Europe who are shoplifting, it's not just the gypsies either, it's as many normal people. 

Whilst it is wrong that you all get tarred with the same brush, you have to understand that it's not just xenophobia. There is a real problem with crime, and quite frankly the shop owners and businesses are right to have had enough of it and be targeting these people directly. When I left the industry last year 75% of the people I was catching were Romanian and that was on top of all the English people who were already stealing. You can keep calling us xenophobic all you want but you've got to lay a big portion of the blame on the people who are committong these crimes, especially when they are committing such heinous acts such as pickpocketing the elderly. Something I'd unfortunately have to deal with on a regular basis. 

I don't mind the travel stereotypes or any of the other negative stereotypes because I understand that majority of them come from some truth and the actions of my fellow countrymen, all I can do is not live up to them and try to live the best way I can. I get why this is such an emotive issue for you and it must be shit to be treated differently because of it, but you've got to understand our point of view.

In his 1953 article ""Soviet Genocide in Ukraine"", he states that the Holodomor was the ""third prong"" of Soviet ""Russification"" of Ukraine:

""What I want to speak about is perhaps the classic example of Soviet genocide, its longest and broadest experiment in Russification — the destruction of the Ukrainian nation. [....] The third prong of the Soviet plan was aimed at the farmers, the large mass of independent peasants who are the repository of the tradition, folklore and music, the national language and literature, the national spirit, of Ukraine. [....] As a Soviet politician Kosior declared in Izvestiia on 2 December 1933, ‘Ukrainian nationalism is our chief danger’, and it was to eliminate that nationalism, to establish the horrifying uniformity of the Soviet state that the Ukrainian peasantry was sacrificed. [....] The crop that year was ample to feed the people and livestock of Ukraine, though it had fallen off somewhat from the previous year, a decrease probably due in large measure to the struggle over collectivization. But a famine was necessary for the Soviet and so they got one to order, by plan, through an unusually high grain allotment to the state as taxes"".

Timothy D. Snyder noted that, during the 1948 convention to define genocide, the Soviets ""made sure that the term genocide, contrary to Lemkin's intentions, excluded political and economic groups."" Thus the Ukrainian famine could be presented as ""somehow less genocidal because it targeted a class, kulaks, as well as a nation, Ukraine.""",,/r/europe/comments/jzkepk/starved_victims_from_the_holodomor_which_killed/gddl3qr/,molokoplus359,1606170033

Beyond the burder of supporting half the empire Hungary also entered into a dick measuring contest with austria, to see who had the most banks, because national pride. While the Austrian economy was based on industrail output, which has a high added value, the hungarian economy was mostly agricultural, which, has a low added value =&gt; the austrian banks could safely issue bigger loans. Of course this being a matter of national pride, hungarian banks issued even bigger loans, however they were usually without cover and the default rate exploded in the 1890s after serveral bad years. Most banks of era were generally funded by a group of rich investors and magnates, and this, combined with the magnate habbit of living the high life in Paris or London, sent many of them into extreme financial trouble, so much so that many had to sell thier land to pay off thier debts.

If you look at the land surveys from the 1860s and 1914 you will see this fenomenon in full force. For example in Transylvania in 1860 close to 90% of the arable land was owned by magantes. In 1918 95% of the land was owned by peasants, which bought the land from various banks after the magnates were forced to sell or had it confiscated.

The search was ended when word came from Turkey that it refused permission, he said, adding that ""no forbidden goods were detected"" and that the crew had been cooperative.

&gt; Even though Bosnia and Herzegovina was still part of the Ottoman Empire, at least formally, the Austrian-Hungarian authorities had factual control over the country. Austria-Hungary waited for a chance to incorporate Bosnia and Herzegovina formally as well. Any action concerning Bosnia and Herzegovina depended on international opinion, which Austrian-Hungarian authorities were aware of. They used the Young Turk Revolution in the Ottoman Empire to finally annex Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Young Turk movement had gained support in mass protests throughout the Ottoman Empire during 1908, with their intention to restore the suspended Ottoman constitution. The Austrian-Hungarian authorities were afraid that the revolution could spread to Bosnia and Herzegovina, as it had support from the Bosnian Muslims and the Serbs, who supported the autonomy of Bosnia and Herzegovina within the Ottoman Empire. On 7 September 1908, the SNO and the MNO demanded that Bosnia and Herzegovina accept the constitution as part of the Ottoman Empire.

5679," The European Union expects Turkey to act toward a de-escalation of tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean, the European Commission’s foreign affairs spokesman Peter Stano has said, while reiterating the bloc’s solidarity with Greece and Cyprus.  


Speaking during a press briefing in Brussels on Monday, Stano said the runup to the European Council and the summit of EU leaders “is a crucial time... for Turkey to show its intentions in actions, whether it wants to de-escalate or to proceed over the course it has taken over the last few weeks and months.”  


Asked about recent meetings between Ibrahim Kalin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman, and EU officials in Brussels, Stano noted that “the EU has been very clear on expectations,” adding that its position had been “conveyed” also during those meetings.  


“The expectation is de-escalation,” Stano said.  


He said that the meeting of EU leaders on December 10-11 would review whether Turkey has done enough to allow for a “constructive dialogue” to resume between the two sides, “or whether all other options would be explored, as outlined by the European Council conclusions of October 1” – a reference to threatened sanctions against Ankara.  


The Commission spokesman meanwhile reiterated the bloc’s solidarity with its two member-states.  


“The EU has expressed its full solidarity with Cyprus and Greece many times when it comes to the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean and Turkish actions,” he said.

So even the next Conservative-Green government has to include the then opposition leader, the Social Democrats. The system is simply build that everyone is constantly forced to make compromises with other parties.

When France acts against islamic terrorism, they see it as a mean to segregates muslims or they conclude that the root of the problem is France's colonial past, ignoring the fact that muslims can very well be imperialist and... bigotted?

Your premise is so deadly wrong, since you think in collective terms, exactly like your Nazi ancestors. Humans are individuals, everybody is responsible for his own deeds only. There is no collective responsibility, your German mentality leads you to think Sippenhaft  is something normal, no it isn't, it is monstrous.

If theft occurs in a store primarily from a certain nationality (which I very doubt), you take exactly the same preventive measures as if the theft were randomly distributed. This is common sense: law enforcement targets individuals, not groups. Profiling perpetrators and constructing types never means ethnic targeting.

There is no link between nationality and crime. Your mentality is too much prisoner of ethnic preconceptions.

&gt;The Treaty of Lisbon strengthens the solidarity  between EU countries in dealing with external threats by introducing a  mutual defence clause (Article  42(7) of the Treaty on European Union).  This clause provides that if an EU country is the victim of armed  aggression on its territory, the other EU countries have an obligation  to aid and assist it by all the means in their power, in accordance with  Article  51 of the United Nations Charter.  
&gt;  
&gt;This obligation of mutual defence is binding on  all EU countries. However, it does not affect the neutrality of certain  EU countries and is consistent with the commitments of EU countries  which are NATO members.  
&gt;  
&gt;This provision is supplemented by the solidarity  clause (Article  222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU) which  provides that EU countries are obliged to act jointly where an EU  country is the victim of a terrorist attack or a natural or man-made  disaster.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/jzfk7m/turkey_prevents_german_peacekeeping_frigate/gdbpb8s/,v3ritas1989,1606134012

Reddit is really bad at reflecting American reality and the 'catastrophizing' voices are the ones drowning others out. 


Part of it is how reddit works, its demographics, but [part of it is just human nature.](https://mediawell.ssrc.org/2020/02/19/forget-fake-news-why-were-wrong-about-nearly-everything-daily-beast/)
