6,"&gt; they will create a headache in the European parliament.

Why is that? 

Let's assume for a moment that the average poll results over all countries are more or less accurate, then the ""euroskeptic"" block would come in somewhere between 20% and 30% of the seats. 

What's the most likely result of that? Basically, that the EPP, which has reigned unchecked for so long that they practically feels as though its their birthright to be in charge, would have to put together some sort of coalition with centrist and centre-left parties, which in turn would give those parties more influence on the issues ahead. 

And that's a *good* thing because the EPP isn't only responsible for some really dredful pieces of legislation, but they aided and abetted people like Orban for ages because they needes his seats. 

Remember: The ""Euroskeptics"" are a *conservative* rebellion and mainly draw votes from the right wing; they aren't diminishing the centre of the left.

I noticed yesterday that even a major newspaper like *Le Monde*, highly supportive of the movement and strongly (sometimes blindly) opposed to Macron, has basically stopped making the coverage of those ""acts"" a priority. Which says a lot, really.

IIRC it was Hannah Arendt who said that what hurt the most weren't the real crazy ones, but the way the more common people would just look the other way about what they were proposing, saying or already doing.

And I can personally relate with that a lot, because I understand crazyness and ignorance, it exists, but what I can't understand is the majority giving them a platform, or more moderate people pacting with them. It's like someone hurting their kids, I can understand one parent being a psycho, but what I can't wrap my head around is the other covering for it, letting the abuse go on.

Germany has been showing quite the firewall with theirs, surely because they're the most hardly reeducated ones in how not to give in to that, but in other places... it just happens.

Spain is finally getting their solid far-right party too in a few weeks. Around 10% of the vote is expected for them. And that's because the press has been giving them aaaall the publicity —they bring spectacle to TV, and online they generate hate, which generates clicks and benefits.

247,"**Paywall:**

An embattled, incompetent leader distrusted and disliked by a vast majority of voters. A wobbly economy that might be tipped into recession by Brexit. A re-energised opposition. Huge street protests. Squabbling with European partners. The government is paralysed, the opposition is emboldened — and the nation stands humiliated, as the world looks on in horror wondering how a leader who was so popular two years ago could get things so wrong.

Not Theresa May, but Emmanuel Macron, the politician who may be the greatest Brexiteer of them all. As the saga of British withdrawal enters its final chapter, Macron has emerged as the loudest advocate for pushing Britain out the door, deal or no deal, consequences be damned.

Why does he behave in this way? Wouldn’t France suffer even more from a no-deal Brexit? But to understand his rage, you need to understand the depth of the hole in which he now finds himself.

It’s now common for Brits to consider themselves the laughing stock of Europe. To be sure, the Westminster drama is embarrassing — but it could be worse. We could be France. Just two years ago, Macron was seen as the great centrist hope not just of France but of Europe. The country’s youngest ever president was elected aged 39¾ to the near unanimous approval of European bien pensants. He promised to drag France out of political, economic and social sclerosis, to see off the menace of populism, sack half a million supernumerary functionaries and make France great again.

He quickly discovered that reform of a state riddled with clientelism and protectionism is easy to talk about but difficult if not impossible to achieve. His predecessors made the same discovery.

His domestic failure has been spectacular and comprehensive. The suburbs are in turmoil and Macron’s vaunted reform project has ground to a halt. The legions of civil servants remain in place, many recently revealed to work less than 35 hours a week. State spending accounts for a gargantuan 58 per cent of the economy, with the highest taxes in Europe to pay for it all. Enterprise is crushed by further taxes on employment, which can double the cost of hiring a worker. Tax cuts are promised but undelivered and cannot be without inflating the alarming deficit or cutting back the state.

The French have had enough. The opinion polls are striking. Macron is now the most unloved leader in Europe, by a distance, according to the YouGov Eurotrack survey. Among Britain, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Macron has achieved a clean sweep, finishing dead last in every category.

Do you approve of the government’s record to date? Seventy-six per cent of French voters disapprove. Do you think the financial situation of your household will change over the next 12 months? By a four-to-one ratio, they think it will get worse. Has the financial situation of your household changed in the past 12 months? Half say it has got worse, or a lot worse. How do you think the country’s economy has changed in the past 12 months? Fifty-seven per cent say it’s worse or a lot worse. A different poll found 75 per cent of French agree that Macron can be referred to as a ‘president for the rich’.

The trajectory of the Macron project has been a case study in hubris. He has taken green politics and tested them to destruction. His putting up of fuel taxes last year while cutting the wealth tax was a manoeuvre so ill-judged as to beggar belief: it seems to show his contempt for those priced out of the cities, who live in provincial areas where they need cars. His diesel tax and carbon tax was the proximate cause for spawning the gilets jaunes movement, which is still bringing cities to a standstill every Saturday. His explanation that fuel prices had to rise to counter climate change cut little moutarde with voters.

France has now had 21 consecutive weekends of demonstrations and riots in which thousands have been arrested, hundreds injured, many gravely, and ten killed. The frequent brutality of the police, relayed instantly on social networks, has been condemned by Amnesty International and the UN. The physical damage has cost hundreds of millions. The reputational hit has been much worse.

Invest in France? Hopes of attracting many bankers from Brexit island have gone up in flames, along with the Porsches on the Avenue Kléber. Macron’s response has been to denounce protesters as ‘enemies’ of the state, and to impose new laws suppressing ‘fake news’. It’s easy to understand his allergy to reporting outside the usually obedient conventional channels.

Sanctimonious he may be, but Macron’s probity is in as much doubt as his competence. His clumsy efforts to cover up a scandal in his inner circle, involving a handsome young bodyguard of North African origin, now fired, but apparently still in touch with Macron’s circle, have shaken even some of the normally complaisant Paris press corps.

And now there’s his latest project, to launch his ambitious ‘EU Renaissance’, a largely inchoate big idea that has strikingly failed to resonate with French people, who have truly not a clue what he is talking about and whose own deeply eurosceptic views are ignored. Having failed to reform France from Paris, he seems to imagine that his reborn EU might do the job for him, delivering the country from 40 years of stagnation.

With Europe as his standard, Macron’s fightback has been unconvincing. For several weeks, France has been treated to the embarrassing spectacle of his great national debate, launched to distract attention from the insurgency of the gilets jaunes. Hailed as a great exercise in consultative democracy, it’s been more of a monologue. He has toured the country, not debating, not listening, but talking, talking, talking, sometimes for three hours with nary a pause. Not even his handpicked audiences could feign rapt attention.

Tellingly, one subject almost entirely excluded from the agenda of this so-called debate was Europe. Macron has never had any intention of consulting the voters on this subject, and for good reason. The French are among the most eurosceptic voters in Europe. They rejected the European constitution in 2005 by 55-45 per cent. (The constitution was subsequently relabelled a treaty and imposed regardless.)

It is a curiosity that Macron remains deeply admired abroad, notably by the Economist, whose Paris correspondent practically worships him, and the New York Times, which has annointed him the anti-Trump. The Washington Post has even swooned over his marriage — a triumph for feminism, apparently. But in France, even those who intend to vote for his list in the forthcoming European parliamentary election will hold their noses.

As his economic reforms have ground to a standstill, and his attempts to buy off the gilets jaunes have pushed France’s debt to the very edge of 100 per cent of GDP, Macron now faces two further tests. Neither may work out for him. It is ironic that if Brexit is thwarted, only Nigel Farage is likely to be more disappointed than Macron. The second is the May election, in which he risks humiliation.",,/r/europe/comments/bcwyrv/emmanuel_macron_has_united_his_country_against_him/eku3sez/,ShortTrifle0,1555199990
248,"Faced with opposition from a barmy extreme left and toxic extreme right, Macron’s candidates may yet emerge with the largest number of seats. The received wisdom is that as much as voters do not like Macron, many will not stomach the alternative. (It is a particularly French expression of democracy that a politician can win an election with a 14 per cent approval rating.)

Or maybe not. Voters who would otherwise vote for Macron as the lesser of two evils in a presidential election may be less scrupulous in a contest for the European parliament. The gilets jaunes are more likely to be motivated to vote, and Macron’s base may not be large enough to push him over the line. Whichever camp is able to declare victory, France is inevitably going to return a large number of eurosceptic MEPs, and with allies from across Europe, they are going to make Macron’s renaissance a mission impossible.

Whither the boy wonder? Macron’s obsession with European federalism has not just alienated him from voters, but has irritated his most important ally, German chancellor Angela Merkel. Germany wants nothing to do with Macron’s proposed fiscal union. Why should Germans pay France’s debts? And lately, she has been especially alarmed by his inflammatory anti-British rhetoric. Macron might imagine that for the cause of his renaissance it’s essential to push the British out into the cold as soon as possible, deal or no deal. Merkel is listening to German industrialists, especially car makers, who call the UK ‘treasure island’.

The prospect of a messy Brexit scares plenty of people in France, too. Officials in the north, closer to the UK than Paris, are in open rebellion. French farmers and fishermen are spooked by the potential loss of markets and fishing rights. Even my neighbours in the south, a long way from the United Kingdom, fear the impact on wine and tourism, which essentially is all they’ve got.

When Macron was elected, a friend of mine who’d worked with him during his brief stint at Rothschild, and who found him an unlikeable and slippery colleague, nonetheless assured me that he was brilliant. He was always a swot, not just impressing but marrying his teacher. He won all the glittering prizes, admission to the École Nationale d’Administration, advancing thereafter to the status of haut fonctionnaire and economy minister under former president François Hollande.

But he is utterly lacking in emotional intelligence. He has failed to temper his narcissism and grandiosity, failed to listen, failed to master the essential art of politics, which is to bring people together, not divide them. His attempted listening tours have ended in disaster. Last summer, he was filmed telling an unemployed gardener how to find work: ‘In hotels, cafés and construction, everywhere I go people say to me that they are looking for staff,’ he said. ‘I can find you a job just by crossing the road.’ The video went viral. In his stubbornness and near autistic indifference to others, Macron has united France against him.

It will now be hard, perhaps impossible, for him to recover his popularity or his agenda which may help explain his Brexit obsession. He sees in it the concerns of provincial people who feel ignored by arrogant elites — the sort of people he’d hoped would go away. Brexit reminds him that they are unlikely to do so. As a result, his European renaissance is as undeliverable as the revolution he promised in France.",,/r/europe/comments/bcwyrv/emmanuel_macron_has_united_his_country_against_him/eku3stf/,ShortTrifle0,1555199999

251,"&gt; In general Asia Minor is still largely pre-Turkic population.

this is a myth. and i'm really tired of seeing this whenever someone mentions native anatolians.

http://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2015/02/18/015396.full.pdf

&gt;Previous genetic studies have generally used Turks as representatives of ancient Anatolians. Our results show that Turks are genetically shifted towards Central Asians, a pattern consistent with a history of mixture with populations from this region

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4236450/
&gt;In comparison, the weight for the migration event predicted to originate from **the branch ancestral to East Asia (presumably Central Asia) into current-day Turkey was 0.217 (21,7%)**

http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12607764/index.pdf

&gt;Moreover, results pointed out that language in Anatolia might not have been replaced by the elites, but by a large group of people. Therefore, it can be concluded that the observations do not support the elite dominance model of Renfrew (1987 ; 1991).

and if you want to see actual Turkic influence, check this map out.

289,"This article is a mess and is very biased in my opinion. The situation with the yellow vests is vastly overrated in social media and foreign media, who often fail to understand the special relationship between the state and the people of France.

First of all, the yellow vests are DEAD. How many guys were protesting this weekend? A few thousand? Come on, that's a joke. That's under 0.01% of the French population (1 out of 10'000). Protests and riots are normal in France. They happen every week, nobody cares. That's just a French tradition and happened already under all previous presidents.

Secondly, Macrons government just announced to lower taxes for the working class, this will shut down the support for these riots completely. People are already tired of smashed windows and burning cars, damaging public property won't solve any problems. Macron isn't the problem, he just brought it up with his reforms. Many Americans (on reddit) have no clue how many hours (30-35) a week French people work, how many vacation (6+) weeks they have, how early they retire (60-62) etc. That's why the taxes are so high. People can't expect the state to pay their whole social welfare program without paying taxes. Macron's reforms were there to make the French economy competetive again, the yellow vest protesters just aren't able to look around the corner. And nope, the French DON'T want another Trump, with his worker policies he wouldn't last a single day in France without revolution. Violent protests like this are coming from a loud minority which are causing even more damage for the economy and local businesses. Unless the French people change some of their socialist attitudes, no president will be able to make one step forward without making two steps backwards.

The yellow vest movement is often portrayed by foreign media as some sort of glorious revolution of the working class, it isn't. It are just many angry people who came together to protest for many different things without having any clue how to realize anything of it.

321,"I'm not advocating for this, I'm simply explaining it. We've seen a number of ""incels"" become violent in the past years. Elliot Rodger and Alek Minassian are probably the two most recent popular examples. Go on /r9k/ or the other incel forums and look at the posts there, it's pretty obvious that many of these people are angry and harbour violent thoughts and phantasies.

It is a real problem and feminism is of course part of the reason why incels have become more common. Back in the day you just married your daughters off and young women didn't spend their days going clubbing or on Tinder sleeping with attractive men while the not-so-attractive ones get left behind. That's a very recent phenomenon.

Yes, because the idea is that in most cases there will be a viable effort possible, which is what the legislator believes. Recitals are interpretive texts.

Clearly, the right holder does not want people to be punished for not making any efforts when no such efforts are available.

353,"This post isn't that much about nicest buildings, but short history.

Traditionally Finland didn't have much architecture as in ""lets *design* buildings"". Rather they were just built. Castles and churches didn't have much designing, more like just building and making them a bit fancy. Tallinn was a hanseatic city, Finland had none, so urbanization here was slower back then compared to Estonia. The largest and oldest city in Finland, which historically was closely connected with hanseatic cities, burned down in 1827, destroying much of the history in the city.

Wood has been abudnant in Finland, so instead of having a lot of stone buildings like in Tallinn, wood has been used much more for urban construction. Perhaps a notable mentions are [Porvo](https://retkipaikka.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/01-Vanha-Porvoo-kirkko.jpg) and [Old Rauma](https://www.visitrauma.fi/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/11/Vanhan_Rauman_talvinen_katu_ja_tornit.jpg) where the high use of wood instead of stone is clear. 

During Russian rule, Finland got a lot of neoclassical buildings, most notably the historic center of [Helsinki](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CLu53FuW8AAuJsr.jpg) with the cathedral, senate and university.

Helsinki has notable amount of jugend buildings. Like [this](https://greenlegsandham.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/helsinki-day-10_210312_002.jpg) and [this](https://previews.123rf.com/images/igorspb/igorspb1504/igorspb150400034/38940674-architecture-jugendstil-dans-la-ville-m%C3%A9di%C3%A9vale-d-helsinki-finlande.jpg) and [this](https://img.ilcdn.fi/NatChGXlR5enB1TFHquWwFlVLXk=/full-fit-in/612x/img-s3.ilcdn.fi/5abb59a40b4babf5af55de8a29b7693c87cf84b04ccb5ae8b6b7b11c4f748949.jpg) are rather common in Helsinki.

From Jugend Finland developed national romantic style like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Lart_nouveau_%C3%A0_Helsinki_limmeuble_Pohjola_%287624127520%29.jpg/383px-Lart_nouveau_%C3%A0_Helsinki_limmeuble_Pohjola_%287624127520%29.jpg) and [this](https://kerranelamassa.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Suomi_Tampere_01.jpg) and [this](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/67/f4/c2/suomen-kansallismuseo.jpg).

From there some architects developed something with similarities to art deco, like [Helsinki Railway Station](https://kerranelamassa.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Suomi_Helsinki_01.jpg) but the general evolution from jugend and national romaticism was towards Nordic Classicims, which is a modern take on classical and ancient styles. For example the [Parliament of Finland](http://remonttireiska.tomstown.poweredbyclear.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/10/eduskuntatalo.jpg) takes influence from ancient egyptian temples.

From there the style evolved into functionalism like [Helsinki olympic stadium](https://www.sttinfo.fi/data/images/00159/ab451655-9065-4a21-9e73-065c8890190e.jpg) and [this hospital](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/02/23/34/02233429d85b315ced4c650173cb239d.jpg).

From there on there was a variety of modernist buildings, a lot of ugly ones, but maybe notables are [Finlandia house](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Finlandia-talo_ulkisivu_itapuolelta_east_side_facade_Photo_Rauno_Traskelin.jpg/1200px-Finlandia-talo_ulkisivu_itapuolelta_east_side_facade_Photo_Rauno_Traskelin.jpg), [Temppeliaukio Church carved in to bedrock](https://www.kotimaa24.fi/wp-content/plugins/Every/image.php?uuid=9e5bc20b-9766-4819-9fcc-9ea25f79a81e&amp;type=preview&amp;function=cover&amp;width=900), [Otaniemi auditorium](https://www.aalto.fi/sites/g/files/flghsv161/files/styles/slider_large/public/2018-06/img_8040.jpg?itok=vX_iGdnJ), [Vallila library](https://www.helsinkidesignweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/24.-Vallila-Library-and-Day-Care-Centre-Helsinki-1991.-Architect-Juha-Leiviska%CC%88.-Photo-Simo-Rista-%C2%A9-Vilhelm-Helander-Juha-Leiviska%CC%88-Architects-1280x900.jpg) and [Hyvinkää church](https://archi-e.fi/system/files/styles/large_image/private/20-8364_0.jpg).

In this century, wood has become more common to use again in public buildings, for example the [Helsinki central library](https://www.teknos.com/globalassets/teknos.fi/teollisuuteen/showroom/oodi-oikea.jpg), and [this](https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/01/Suvela-Chapel-by-OOPEAA-9-889x666.jpeg), [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/be/4b/e1/be4be1d6ab6ae237eef5a35934f238f0.jpg) and [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5f/4c/49/5f4c49ae66a2742bfacfcd580ea70005.jpg) chapel.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/bcs0oq/ugly_industrial_western_helsinki_1987/ekttfdm/,Toby_Forrester,1555192566

406,"Ok I'll leade you through my thoughts. Pathological hatred for all Russian is clouding your mind. It suits your corrupt leaders to gain cheap points and distract you from economic issues that they are incompetent to solve. Russians warmongering? They are incapable of war against the West. They are countering NATO's and American advances. If you don't believe me, check where NATO borders are and where Americans have their military bases. Russians are securing their geopolitical strong points. Allowing NATO to exercise in Eastern Europe can have no other result than the insecure Russians to try to prevent it. If that means changing party in government, they will do it. Poland can serve you as a good example what happens if they don't. Americans install anti-missile shield that breaks the balance of nuclear deterrence. Who does the ballistic shield benefit? Poland? Russians can hit them with just about anything else than missiles. It is pointless.

Now put yourself if the Putin's boots. Since Russian economy and military are a shadow of Soviet potential that leaves them with a single effective defence alternative. That is nuclear arsenal. If Americans can negate it via ballistic shield, Russians can sell themselves into neoliberal slavery. So Putin has on the homefront hardly controllable corrupt and greedy oligarchs, C.I.A. funded NGOs inciting anti-government sentiments and high military expendiures, to compete with the West. In the west he has entire mainstream media with hate propaganda, NATO (a purposely anti-Russian organisation) at doorstep, encroaching Americans in Central Asia and Ukraine. So not very rosy situation. If you want to know more how Russian geopolitics work, here a nice [video](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHE6rSljTwdU&amp;ved=2ahUKEwil_YTS5s3hAhXM16QKHbHjAi8QwqsBMAB6BAgEEAU&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Z1EoXHXEe4s8fKZMyafU5).

Now I know it's a pain to be a Russian neighbour. But it is stupid to think that ones action won't have wider consequences. Time to be wise and refrain from irrational eruptions. Eastern Europe should learn from Finland and Austria which got their independence, basically, for free and Soviets kept their promises.

End thoughts. Europe has to break out of Cold war pat position and take the region back in their hands. For that every country would be necessary, especially as big as Poland, people with well educated and with enlightened mindset and not some corrupt, clerical medieval nonsense that Polish or Hungarian nationalists want. It's time to balance Russia and USA and start benefiting from it or Eastern Europe will be eternal backyard of Westeuropean capitalists.",,/r/europe/comments/bcgtx7/poland_denies_russian_training_ship_entry_on_its/ekthuin/,delete013,1555184794

482,"&gt; Because the way you define an important player is by whether they are in the EU or not? I don't see Chinese companies having large presences in the EU. Are they not important on a global scale?

Actually, I see it. China has been buying up stuff in Europe for about a decade now, to a degree that people start to get worried.

* https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-china-business-in-europe/
* https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2167791/hoppstaedten-weiersbach-idyllic-german-village-thats-now-home-1000

Anything physically located in China is, of course, pretty much out of reach, given the government's track record -- but when it comes to harvesting data, I don't think you can deny the most important firms all sit in the US, where we historically have much better chances of pressing for enforcement, if they don't have a subsidiary physically located in the EU in the first place, which is the case for the most important companies.

&gt; So, China collecting data on you and then selling it would be fine? I hope not!

Certainly not, but whom is China going to sell these to, and how would they acquire them in the first place? It's not like weibo is a popular social media platform for European citizens. You said it yourself earlier: the best way to control your data is not to leak it. Given we're living in the 21st century, I'd argue this has become impossible (unless you're a hermite), but we can certainly make sure that the companies EU citizens interact with on a daily basis - which, logic should suggest, predominantly have a presence in the EU - treat it with respect.

&gt; So, why isn't Europe among those established? Do we not have smart people that would like to work on it?

I'd argue the primary reason is simply because the US came first. Their biggest advantage can be summed up in two words: Silicon Valley. The smart people Europe does produce tend to get hired mostly by US-owned companies, and when they work their way up within said company, they transfer to the US where the corporation has its R&amp;D. At least this is exactly how it works in the international company I'm employed at.

&gt; I believe that this is why Europe didn't develop more strong tech companies and why we're now getting all of our major online services from abroad.

The irony here is that Article 13 is going to his those major online services the most, because they've used the lack of regulation to get as big as they are, thus stifling competition.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bbmbvf/i_hope_so_that_eu_press_conferences_about/ektj9ce/,akashisenpai,1555185694

524,"So, um, yeah. A couple of hours ago I was interested in the lines in top right. It turns out to be the Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen, the oldest area in the Netherlands where groundwater (filtered by the dunes) is used as drinking water.

Then I saw the border of North- and South-Holland going just past it. I started wondering what course that border took. For those interested, it follows four major parts. The first part starts at the triple point of the Hollands and Utrecht and runs through the Amstel and Drecht (small rivers), where it changes course just south of some lakes where peat was excavated, resulting in these waters. The third part is around the Haarlemmermeer up to the last part. The line runs from the polder to the North Sea across an old line that was an administrative border for the counts of Holland. The area North of the border went all the way up to Egmond. Egmond, hmm, why did the count of Egmond become so influential, while the area isn't at all.

So yeah, thanks Wikipedia for that rabbit hole. Tl;Dr the House of Egmond was protector (voogd in Dutch, landvoogd comes from this word) of the Abbey of Egmond, helped the counts of Holland in their battles against the West-Frisians in the tip of nowadays Holland, and at the end of the 13th century Willem II became Lord of Egmond, changing their loyalty from protector to vassal. His greatgrandchild, John/Jan II had two sons. His oldest son, Arnold, is the grandchild of the Duke of Gelre. After a succession war, Arnold became the Duke of Gelre. Arnolds son, Adolf, gets rid of him with the help of Philips the Good*. Philips son, Charles the Bold*, helped Arnold again. Arnold made Charles his heir, but the states of Gelre made Adolf the Duke. Adolfs son, Charles II was in a quarrel with Charles^ V (that Charles!) and after his childless death, the duchy was lost to Charles V.  
The other son of Jan II was Willem IV. He inherited everything except Gelre. His second son, Frederik, inherited the barony of IJsselstein and got the count of Buren. This branch died out with Anna van Egmond van Buren, wife of Willem of Orange. Van Buren may be recognised by other Dutchies as a familiar name for a famous ice skater.  
The eldest son of Willem IV, Jan III, inherited Egmond and by his services became Count of Egmond by Maximilian^ I (uncle of Charles V). Lamoraal I, his grandson, was a famed general for Charles V and helped him in his war in Gelre (against his kin!). He is the most famous Count of Egmond, since he, together with the Prince of Orange and the Count of Horne were the most important nobility of the Low Lands and thus the representatives in the conflict between the nobility of the Low Lands and the King of Spain Philips^ II, son of Charles V. He and Horne were beheaded by the Duke of Alva, (Willem had fled to Dillenburg, his ancestral home) and this can be seen as one of the starting points of the Eighty Years War/the Dutch Revolt.",,/r/europe/comments/bco0ze/spring_is_in_the_air_and_the_tulip_fields_in_the/ekt7cls/,JoHeWe,1555177813

As per Article 6, it seems proactive measures ""only"" become mandatory for services that have received a takedown request, and they seem to center on making the re-upload of the same material impossible. This is obviously an attempt at curbing the dissemination of stuff like a certain massacre's video so as to prevent whack-a-mole situations.

Subsection 2.b seems to allude to a more general approach, but given the Directive also talks about the protection of rights, this must be carefully balanced and could just end up being something like a keyword alert that flags a video for staff review.

From the Annex:

*""For proactive measures, the responsibility for identifying, assessing and removing content remains with the hosting service providers and they are required to put in place safeguards to ensure content is not removed erroneously, including through human review, particularly if further contextualisation is required. Furthermore, unlike in the baseline scenario where the most affected companies set up automated tools without public oversight, the design of the measures as well as their implementation would be subject to reporting to competent bodies in Member States. This obligation reduces the risks of erroneous removals both for companies setting up new tools as well as for those who are already using them. In addition, hosting service providers are required to provide user-friendly complaint mechanisms for content providers to contest the decision to remove their content as well as publish transparency reports to the general public.""*

&gt; Then there is this 60min content takedown requirement.

The exact wording is ""within receipt"". What I'd like to know is the legal definition of this term, i.e. whether this means when the email pops up on your server, or when it is actually *read* by an employee. Huge difference for smaller companies like the Internet Archive.

You don't have to make those hash filters, or any type of filter, monitor all content. You could only monitor users who have a track record of violations for instance. Although, realistically, since the law doesn't _ban_ monitoring everything either, I think member states will end up requiring it voluntarily. 

&gt; First off all, all websites have casualties. The law says exception to liability are limited. If a company fall back to notice and takedown they get sued. The directive says a wbesites has to make efforts, that a diligent professional actor would make. Letting hours of unedited copyrighted content on your service is not diligent and thus, hash filters are not enough.

It's not up to companies but up to member states. Companies don't have to follow the directive.

598,"&gt; The last Catalan survivor to the Nazi concentration camps, Neus Català, died this Saturday at the age of 103 years old. Català, who maintained his communist militancy until the end, spent 15 months in the Ravensbrück camp, in Germany, and fought all his life for memory after fighting first in favor of the Second Republic and, later, together with the French resistance against the Nazis. After her family confirmed the news of her death, the militant has been remembered by several organizations of the Catalan left.

If you are against the new directive, then you are for the old ones, right? The ones that are vague about what is and isn't legal and vary for each country?

The new directive is certainly not perfect, but is it an improvement to what we have? I think so. For example:

&gt; (70) The steps taken by online content-sharing service providers in cooperation with rightholders should be without prejudice to the application of exceptions or limitations to copyright, including, in particular, those which guarantee the freedom of expression of users. Users should be allowed to upload and make available content generated by users **for the specific purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody or pastiche.** That is particularly important for the purposes of striking a balance between the fundamental rights laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  (“the Charter”), in particular the freedom of expression and the freedom of the arts, and the right to property, including intellectual property. **Those exceptions and limitations should, therefore, be made mandatory in order to ensure that users receive uniform protection across the Union**. It is important to ensure that online content-sharing service providers operate an effective complaint and redress mechanism to support use for such specific purposes.

The reason most feminists* don't talk about discrimination against men isn't because they're actually not against it, it's because they just... don't bring it up. For some people, it's because it's not topical. For others, it's because it makes it harder to argue about society being ultra-patriarchal. And for a lot of people, it's because nobody sat them down and pointed out the ways men are being discriminated against.

It's a bit like how people that are normally real quick to call out bigotry against people with mental disorders will typically go very quiet when they hear people bashing pedophiles. Logically, they should be defended too, but it still very rarely happens.

924,"Well, I don't feel too strongly about that question, and in the latter years I barely download any media through unauthorised channels, but I answered that I believe it should be legal (or in the case of my country, remain legal).

I think that non-profit (lots of emphasis on this part) sharing of media is generally positive for society and culture: it gives people access to elements that can improve their happiness while at the same time I don't believe it has a great impact on how many of them will pay for those products.

In principle, I don't find it very different from sharing physical objects with other people (for many of which, just like digital media, sharing them doesn't decrease their value for the owner). Sure, the tool factory would prefer it if your neighbour bought a new hammer instead of borrowing yours when you are not using it (they might even make it illegal if they were given the political power to do so), but I think it's better for society that you are allowed to lend it to them. Most people are not rich enough to buy everything they want or need, but if they can nevertheless get access to some things (even if less convenient than just owning them), they can improve their own happiness without costing others anything. That hammer might even be a small in enabling your neighbour to in turn create or do something that benefits the rest of society.

In conclusion: while I barely engage in digital piracy anymore, I think that if properly restricted to non-profit, unauthorised file-sharing can be a positive factor in society.",,/r/europe/comments/b6ybwr/2_million_subscribers_special_the_reurope_survey/eksci5i/,NumberNinethousand,1555148899

965," Update: The Internet Archive offers this correction: CORRECTION: This post previously identified the sender of the 550 falsely identified URLs as Europol’s EU Internet Referral Unit (EU IRU). The sender was in fact, the French national Internet Referral Unit, using Europol’s application, which sends the email from an @europol.europa.eu address. The EU IRU has informed us that it is not involved in the national IRUs’ assessment criteria of terrorist content.

    And, as the Archive explains, there's simply no way that (1) the site could have complied with the Terrorist Content Regulation had it been law last week when they received the notices, and (2) that they should have blocked all that obviously non-terrorist content.

    The Internet Archive has a few staff members that process takedown notices from law enforcement who operate in the Pacific time zone. Most of the falsely identified URLs mentioned here (including the report from the French government) were sent to us in the middle of the night – between midnight and 3am Pacific – and all of the reports were sent outside of the business hours of the Internet Archive.

    The one-hour requirement essentially means that we would need to take reported URLs down automatically and do our best to review them after the fact.

    It would be bad enough if the mistaken URLs in these examples were for a set of relatively obscure items on our site, but the EU IRU’s lists include some of the most visited pages on archive.org and materials that obviously have high scholarly and research value.",,/r/europe/comments/bcljsi/french_officials_call_project_gutenberg_archive/ekscq5x/,Oelingz,1555149280

984,"&gt; For extra reading, an article from **today's** Independent

The article is over 3 years old, so let's not pretend that you stumbled upon it this morning by coincidence and didn't go looking for something to reinforce your own opinion.

Without getting into the general lack of journalistic integrity that the Independent has displayed for a number of years now, this article in particular lacks any sort of nuance (it is unambiguously agenda driven). 

For Brits today, the relationship with the Empire is complicated. Moreover, it is possible to be both proud and ashamed of our Imperialist past, insomuch as either of these sentiments are justified for something none of us were personally involved with. 

If you don't think that there was anything worthwhile or admirable accomplished by the British Empire then you are really no better than the Jingoists who believe it could do no wrong. 

Whether, on balance, it was an overall force for good is another matter entirely and a worthwhile argument having (far more insightful than the somewhat asinine polling of pride in Empire). 

It also ignores that in practically every country with an imperialist past  there is a strong sense of national pride in the country's history (this is not a uniquely British thing). I mean, ffs, this is common in India (and much of the rest of Asia) itself and can hardly be called a Western thing. 

Lastly, and this is pedantry but whatever, the poll presented in the article found that 43% of those polled said that they were proud of the British Empire. From that they created a headline that read ""British people are proud of Empire and Colonialism"" despite the research they use to justify this suggesting that a majority of Brits don't.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/bck4rv/today_it_is_the_100th_anniversary_of_the_amritsar/ekscukq/,MyFavouriteAxe,1555149488

1057,"&gt; This will work so long as the productivity growth supports it.

Up until now, Poland did manage to balance rapid pay rises with very rapid productivity increases, meaning ULC (unit labor costs) were kept down to their historical norm of around 2%. But even the NBP is no longer forecasting this - and they have usually been more bullish than most independent analysts - and are now expecting wage increases to outpace productivity growth. You can't play that game forever without seeing its logical conclusion. It's a game that poorer countries with lackadaisical fiscal discipline have been playing for decades and it inevitably sees a significant correction.

&gt; I'm not sure the popular wisdom of only spending when the economy dips is the best approach

Keynes is one of the most misunderstood men in economic history. Many people who espouse his theories have evidently not read his actual work.

And you know when ones ""non-genocidal organized mass killing of Armenians"" is also mentioned together to ""non-genocidal organized mass killings of Assyrian"" and ""non-genocidal organized mass killings of Greeks"" one might take a step back and maybe reevaluate.
Again, turkey doesn't argue that it idnt happen, it just refuses to call a genocide.

1117,"&gt; I'm happy for anyone to question my sources. I just find it odd that you'd focus on that one, when it is the least important. 

And yet you still haven't posted it. If it is so unimportant  why the reticence? Why post it at all?

As I've said I'm only interested in intent, and your quote from a document which hasn't been digitised seems very fortuitously to go against all other information regarding Churchill's extreme advocacy of the use of poison gas from his appointment as Minister of Munitions on.

Intent is the only reason I discussed WW2 because there were others arguing that Churchill said ""poison"" but meant something else. Yet in WW2 he displayed a willingness to break international law by proposing both using poison gas and invading a neutral power, to then go on to propose *drenching* to be carried out on large numbers of civilians. He would clearly need less provocation to use poison gas in the 20s as (a) there was no ban in place and (b) his rather *closed* world view towards people of ""other races"" meaning there was no need of *exceptional* circumstances to overcome reticence in others towards plans involving poison gas, the very thing that blocked him in 1944.

&gt;Ironic, considering that that you utterly failed to cite any sources yourself in your comment about M Devices. 

I replied to you in the mode you replied to me - making assertions with no sources. If you are querying the assertions I make just posting another author's summary of source material isn't really an answer.  Unless you have read the sources, as in the relevant ministry memos, notes and other documentation, describing M devices their content and deployment, and link them that I might look over them too all you're doing is matching your own bias confirmation to a source of information.  I'd much prefer to make up my own mind.

This is not true. He was in the guardianship of his father at the time (his parents apparently do not live together) and he had ran away from the apartment, presumably when the father was asleep. When he discovered that his son was missing, he alerted the police. 

Remember he was on the same mental level as a young child, it's not like his parents would *allow* him to run around with a gun in the middle of the night. 

So, I think it's unfair to blame the parents the way you do.

The strange part is, the police *knew* there was a guy with downs syndrome running around in the area, but these officers, for whatever reason did not take this into consideration. They were looking for another guy who was actually in jail at the time (which is not that hard to check).

Hah. I give it 20 at most. The European Union/United States of Europe project is already finished - right now it's in the slow downwards spiral towards the grave.

I would argue that putting a slew of different nations with distinct cultures, languages, histories, attitudes, economies, geographies, etc. and merging them together into one federation is a... bad idea to begin with. Anyone who expected a Federal Europe to work like the U.S. was wrong from the start.

But regardless, at this point I don't think anything that can salvage the EU. The Euro crushed the economies of the southern states (This video explains how at 45:45 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feU7HT0x_qU), the migrant crisis more or less ripped apart Schengen, and now one major member is leaving and several other members are essentially in open rebellion.

It would be beneficial for many of the ASEASN states to work together and resist against China's claims to the South China Sea, but instead they do not. 

China has more-or-less bought off Cambodia, is courting the Philippines, etc. Consequently, it's impossible for ASEAN to put up a unified front and counter Chinese influence on this issue. While this doesn't individually harm every ASEAN country, it does significantly harm some key states (e.g. Vietnam), and I would argue ASEAN as a whole. China will likely do the same in Italy and Eastern European members of the EU such that, it will be difficult for the EU to act as one on China-related issues. 

This isn't to say that all of China's actions are bad or anything of the sort.

1504,"The UK was vital, though it depends on what the 'start' is considered. Some regions teach the start of WW2 as the Japanese invasions of Korea and China in 1931.

I do agree that the UK cannot be underestimated. The UK basically drove the Germans and Italians out of North Africa nearly by themselves, which was vital since it denied the Axis vital raw materials and natural resources to fuel their war industry.

The UK also essentially single handedly killed Nazi Germany's air force and navy. An intact Axis air force and naval force could have out flanked the Russian corps on the coastline and ceded vital train yards to the Axis. The British and later Americans were the forces that stopped these advances, since Russia lacked any effective navy.

Americans and British also fed the Russians vital intelligence during multiple battles.

And also helped contain the Japanese. The Japanese, had they gotten the Americans and Australians to surrender, would have made a pivot and struck Russia from a new open front. People always forget about the Asia-Pacific front.

&amp;#x200B;

The WW2 Soviet Russians in general were on a strict timer. They were losing troops at rates that were not sustainable, and even today have not really recovered in population. Had the Japanese dug into their reserves in 1941, which the Japanese almost certainly would have done had they not had to worry about the Americans and British, the Russians would have had loss rates of their new conscripts increased even higher, perhaps to even more unsustainable levels, and collapsed.

&amp;#x200B;

WW2 Russia also lacked strategic and heavy tactical bombers to hit industry targets and do air supply, so had to have some loaned to them as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Could Russia have won WW2 by itself? Maybe, but much less likely. Almost certainly not if the Asia Pacific front opened up.

1576,"Usually you would expect the opposite in that situation, high demand begets high prices unless there is an equivalent or oversupply.

I think it's largely because there isn't that much competition between hotels in Brussels compared to the other major European cities and it doesn't attract the more expensive luxury brands which are naturally more likely to get higher ratings thus pushing them into the top 5 that the map assesses. 

Berlin is a more interesting example as it still has a pretty low price but does offer some of those high priced luxury brands, however these brands don't rank so highly. London is perhaps a better example of what you're saying actually, as there is a lot of competition including the luxury brands in a very expensive and in demand city, yet it is cheaper than Amsterdam, Rome, and much cheaper than Paris which are the closest equivalent cities.

Legally they inherited USSR, though.  
And also RSFSR was the main republic to participate in wars.  
BUT since, for example, Baltic states' participation in conflict through NATO is a thing, why not look into their participation in USSR conflicts as part of USSR?

Sometimes five languages when you consider english for all the tourists, or norwegian for selling across the border.

Having this kind of separation is of course really bad for the culture as a whole, and afaik some attempts, by people pointing out how destructive it is, have been made to unify the alphabet and the spelling, and keep the unique dialects. They were unsuccessful.

It mirrors the seperation between the swedes, norwegian, and danish languages to an extent. They could have by the time of the kalmar union unified the language and reshaped history as we know it.

1743,"We started entering the world of super states in the late 20th century with the formation of economic and then seemingly political unions, so in my opinion a European super-state is inevitable, is it a necessity in the modern age? Federalists will argue yes while reformists and patriots would argue no. I think the EU will come to represent Europe just as much as USA represents North America. I don’t believe Russia would ever join because, even more so than Britain, they value their countries sovereignty and have strong patriotic, even nationalist tendencies. Will Britain rejoin? I have no idea, it depends on so many factors not with counting the state and federalisation rate of the EU. 

I think, as we have seen Brussels trade orbit will continue to grow and the EU will be an economic superpower in the future but they have a lot of reform both monetarily and politically to go through before it becomes popular with the majority. The Euro hasn’t turned out to be as great as once expected because, you could argue, a single currency only truly works with a true central fiscal and monetary policy committee. Two things have majorly shaped modern euroscepticism movement, the migrant crisis, terrorism and resultant islamophobia and the Great Recession of 2008. there are many other sticking points but no need to go into them.

I myself think that the EU needs major reform especially in the fact that their legislature isn’t directly elected by the people as the European Parliament only has power to amend and reject laws rather than create them (which the commission currently do), also on tax matters, the European Parliament have very little say in creating and even amending tax and budget laws which needs a massive overhaul in my opinion.",England,/r/europe/comments/bcgf70/serious_question_is_there_no_future_for_a/ekqftdk/,Bloke22,1555091485

If you do use PM or a private chatroom to avoid vote brigading considering many people on reddit unironically see downvote as a counter argument.

If your goal is to counter nationalist propaganda then these sorts of decisions are actually very counterproductive and achieve the opposite of what you want. These decisions create a toxic atmosphere where jingoism thrives. Also, ultimately, it is the job of Turks to face and come to terms with their own history. It is not the job of the international community or anyone else to force or bully Turks to accept a certain version of history.

1899,"\&gt; Or the Irish war of independence? They lost control of 5/6ths of the island. 

True it was an overwhelming success for the IRA- but was it a military defeat? The British were not really kicked out by Irish force of arms - major cities remained in British control and there was a compromise peace (that as I'm sure you know was not seen as much of a victory by most of the IRA). The defeat came as much in moral terms (liberal British pressure and American influence) as military - does that count as a defeat? 

According to wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael\_Collins\_(Irish\_leader)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(Irish_leader))) 

&gt;There remains uncertainty as to the two sides' capability to have  carried on the conflict much longer. Collins told Hamar Greenwood after  signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty: ""You had us dead beat. We could not have  lasted another three weeks. When we were told of the offer of a truce  we were astonished. We thought you must have gone mad""

Those key people then want to do corrupt stuff, and the population can not stop them since they are supressed, the leader can not stop them since he needs them to stay in power. Whatever you save in election costs and party politics is eaten many times over by corruption and whatever else keeps the leader in power.

1925,"&gt;But it is inat. I totally agree regarding RSK and RS, and it’s true that the West’s double standards are ridiculous and transparent.

Well, if standing up and not giving up in the face blatant injustice is inat, so be it.

&gt;But let’s ignore the past, because let’s be honest - the West aren’t Serbia’s blood enemies. It’s all based off of geopolitics (REALPOLITIK), not off of morals or what’s right. 

No shit Sherlock, 100 years ago we were their Balkan buddies. Could be that again in 100 years, geopolitics loves to shift.

&gt;What is Serbia going to gain from staying stubborn? Kosovo is basically NEVER gonna be back, in any form — 90%+ of the population, as well as the West, don’t think it strategic to just hand it back, and there wont be significant change to that for a long time.

Well, we waited like 450 years to get it back the last time so we do have patience. Sure, the Albanians don't want be a part of Serbia, but they can be beaten military and pacified by rights and benifits after. As for the West, the world is shifting against them. China's gonna be the no. 1 power in this century. Without their hegemony, what they say won't matter much.

&gt;What is Trepča worth when Serbia can join the EU with greater ease and secure millions in investments and more in protection of democracy, institutions, and the average person?

Trepča alone isn't worth as much but you're not just giving up on it. Also, what your saying is pretty much that we should sell out to the side that is practically our enemy.

&gt;Do you really want Serbia to be 20%+ Albanian? Aren’t you sick of this issue?

If they can actually be integrated, no, I don't. If they can't be, well, making them leave won't be too hard. Be tough on them and keep them poor, they'll leave on their own. Settle some Serbs in and that'll do the trick.

&gt; What is continuing to fight for the entirety of Kosovo worth when SPC can protect monasteries and Serbian heritage through a compromise deal?

Yeah, sorry, but I really don't trust the Albanians or their NATO sponsors on such a deal. Besides, while I'm not religious most Serbs are, and to them those sites mean a lot, and all Kosovo really, which is seen as a holy land, And will not accept it not being a part of Serbia.

You could be right, it could end up like Norway, I think even the Biggest Brexiteers would prefer to remain than that option.

Personally I do feel that arguments about the drop in standards are often framed poorly ultimately the decision in the example of poorly reared chickens (which is the reason their chlorinated it's not the process of clorination that's the issue I believe)  the decision is one of 2.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Cheaper Chicken, reared with poor living standards and chlorinated in an attempt to clean free from issues caused by the poor rearing conditions. 

2) Possibly more expensive Chicken, but raised by Standards that Match the ones we're currently used too, with (feel free to correct me) lower chances of food poisoning.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that way honestly proposes the realities and either answer is acceptable, sometimes we just want cheap chicken, sometimes we care more about the chicken. Either is acceptable reasons for a decision.

Så vidt jeg husker kritiserede han hvordan udregningerne af temperaturændringerne var blevet lavet, anslog en noget lavere ændring, og konkluderede på den baggrund at det var bedre at bruge pengene på andre ting end at forhindre *hans* tal for opvarmning.

How about we look at the current industry standard methods on how sites deal with people posting copyrighted stuff.

After that, if the user is caught again then they are banned or the suspension is made significantly longer.

2148,"&gt; Yeah, I would say I'm unfamiliar with the Chilcot report, because I'm not a UK citizen, so I don't care for these news. See how this works?

This is absolutely fine. What is not fine is to say that Chilcot report somehow proves your point when you your self admit you know nothing about it. 

&gt;If it concerns European borders, yeah. No surprise there either, since - again - it concerns them.

Those are literally routine flights, they happen every month or so.

&gt;and on the other it lets people be angry at yet another Russian provocation.

There is nothing provocative about Russian planes flying in international airspace. This is media which has to invent this provocation in order to come up with at least some ""Russia bad"" news. The real ""Russia bad"" news would have been much more welcome by them.


&gt;Even assuming this alleged unfair bias to be true, that doesn't really say much. There's a publication for everything and everyone -- ""supply and demand"".

So why did those publications completely ignored those new Russian leaks that wikileaks refused to publish? Why even Ukrainian media, which openly state that they fight Russia in informational space, completely ignored them? Can you explain that? 

&gt;It appears that the media did ultimately pick up on the part that concerned the presidential election, by the way

No, read the article again. This article mentions no specific leaks what so ever. They just list what sort of information should or could be there. But absolutely nothing about any actual information from the leaks.   So I ask you again, why NYT run an article about the leaks, but did not run any articles based on information provided by those leaks?  Clearly, if they put an article about those leaks, they thought that there is enough interest about them.

2179,"Would you mind articulating why your vote is important then?

Well, that part of my argument is that elections are seldom decided by a single vote. In fact, that happens so rarely that for any given voter the probability that their vote will be decisive approaches zero. That is, the more people vote in an election, the stronger my argument actually gets because indeed, as you said, the likelihood of a single vote being decisive is a function of the total number of votes.

 If I understand you correctly, you are suggesting that this thought is self-defeating because there is some game theoretic value in the voting game where enough people avoid voting that going to vote becomes profitable again. There are multiple parts here that I do not agree with. For example, it is well known in psychology and economics that very few people behave in a game theoretically optimal way, but rather most seem to behave in accordance with first and second order thinking (which by the way appears to be highly advantageous in a surprising number of situations) . It is also self-evident by the numbers that do show up to vote that the likelihood of any given vote to be decisive is just astronomically low. And finally, to mention the effects that a large majority brings when it comes to political wiggle room, even when voting does affect policy, how much does it affect it and how much of it matches the intent of the voters?

I also want to shoehorn an opinion about populism: People are stupid, but not that much. Supporting the populists is equal parts dissatisfaction with their current situation, believing the lies, and giving a big middle finger at the established political elite. IMO to bring populism down, people need to be given more power over the elite.",Cyprus,/r/europe/comments/bbxvf3/wikileaks_cofounder_julian_assange_arrested/ekpasb5/,roullis,1555063232

And if your income declines such as when you retire, you get to the point where you cannot afford private insurance anymore. Individuals who choose to buy private insurance cannot get back into the social insurance system unless they fall below the poverty line. What happens if you cannot afford private insurance but you do not fall beneath the poverty line? What do you give up your house or insurance? Medical bills are not going to go away.

These have found a high risk of mental disorders among those facing the threat of over-indebtedness as well as the association of over-indebtedness with an increased prevalence of overweight and obesity apart from traditional socioeconomic factors. **Additionally, there is evidence that over-indebted persons refrain from seeking medical treatment or purchasing prescriptions even under Germany’s health system.** **One-third of participants in a study of insolvency counseling services in Rhineland–Palatinate indicated that their financial difficulties were a result of accident, illness or addiction.**  
A number of responses noted that medical costs are present in a growing number of personal debts. These included Belgium, - **Page 9**

&gt;In the past few years, the number of over-indebted private households in **Germany has steadily increased and is currently estimated to have reached 3.13 million.** Financial difficulties culminating in private insolvencies of the persons concerned may lead to **a restrained usage of health-care services that require additional payment.**  
The majority of participants stated to refrain from buying prescribed medication **(65.2%)** as well as from seeking medical advice and paying euro 10.00 own contribution **(60.8%)** because of their financial situation.

Except this isn't true, last time i checked 5 schools already removed their No Outsiders programme because of the protests and the group's intention is to remove it from every school. It matters because they are indeed imposing their religious views on social politics. Nobody would care if it was just a loud obnoxious minority screaming.

Also in the original school 95% of the kids were removed from the school because of the programme, so the argument of ""small minority of Muslims"" also doesn't always work out.

2267,"I agree with a lot of the sentiments on here but in Sweden the tax system does a whole lot. Its become hard to reward employees because of all the benefit taxes.

An example from the changes last year:
Employers have often offered private health insurance even though we have public health care in the country. This is so you can get access to experts quicker and be back to work quicker so it makes financial sense for them. Going about it this way also offloaded the public first instances. Ie. its just a privatized way to skip queueing, the level of healthcare is hardly different. Companies that did offer this would usually offer it to every employee regardless of job or level. It did cost 500SEK per errand rather than the public 160SEK with a 1000SEK a year ceiling. There was no extra benefit tax prior to last year.

Last year they added a benefit tax making it so that most people have to pay an extra 200-400SEK benefit tax per month depending on their income if they had the insurance. This in addition to the 500SEK per errand fee. Also the private alternative doesn't have a ceiling so basically you pay 2400SEK+ per year regardless of if you use it or not + 500SEK per errand. This might not sound so bad but suddenly people with lower salaries don't benefit nearly as much from it and many exit the benefit programs turning it into more of a class question where only those who can afford it skip queues and everyone else have to join the public queues making them even longer than before and compounding the impact on people with lower salaries. 

How can companies try to make right by their employees if benefits they keep offering eventually get punished and taxed to the point that poor people have to say no to their employers wanting to give them bonuses and benefits...

2268,"Overall it seems that the access to the sea helps both economically (if you have someone to trade with) and militarily. And more surrounded by it you are, the more benefit you have. 

Nordic countries were basically comparatively mostly unaffected by the two world wars (except for Finland, which lacks behind the most) and they had close proximity to main colonial powers through sea routes in past centuries (it was sea trade which made Norway so rich and later oil). For the most part, the main enemies you had were only other Nordic countries or enemies you were willing to have. Denmark had some conflicts with Germany, but nothing existential.

For example the netherlands, austria, germanny the chech republic had been under a collective empire for over 500 years in the form of the holey roman empire. Which led to our cultures to be closer to eachother.
Next to that is that scandinavian/anglican and germanic cultures are also heavily intertuined throughout history.

That's the default outcome and all the evidence we've seen so far is that the UK can't agree on anything changing from this default course, whether to accept the WA or to hold a referendum/elections with an eye towards cancelling Article 50. 

I'm not expert either, but my understanding is that the EU would not negotiate with the UK on a withdrawal agreement *until* Article 50 had been triggered. I don't think it was completely surprising what the EU would and would not give ground on even 3 years back--like the UK was never going to get access to the common market without freedom of movement. That was foreseeable, the Northern Ireland border issue was foreseeable, but at the same time before the negotiations started after the Art. 50 declaration, I guess leavers could have always claimed that somehow magically the UK could in fact get everything it wanted. Which of course now we know is not true, and which a reasonable person at that time could have anticipated to not be true, but then this whole Brexit stuff in my opinion is built on a bit of fantasy about the UK's role in the world.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/bbnr62/the_scream_circa_2019/ekp529q/,sowenga,1555056316

2439,"The Declaration of Independence didn't say anything about governmental setup. It was just a statement from the 13 colonies that basically gave the middle finger to Britain while screaming your not the boss of us. Which the Brits predictably responded to with an army. After that got sorted, something called the articles of confederation was drafted which was kinda this loose defense pact between the states and generally worked out terrible. After a few years of the states doing their thing as effectively completely separate currencies the articles collapsed because the federal government under the articles had no real power and couldn't even demand money or troops from the states to do the whole defending the collective thing. At that point the founding fathers were just about done with the states BS and basically locked a bunch of state representatives in Philadelphia until they could agree on something that had a snowballs chance in hell of actually functioning. When they finally settled on something after 5 months the US constitution was drafted which laid federal government in the basic form it is today except the federal government was much weaker and wasn't even able to issue a currency... Until 10 years later when presumably someone slapped some sense into the state governments to make them realize 13 separate currencies is not viable you dumb asses. Then the Civil War (War between States?) and the Louisiana Purchase (in which Napoleon basically gave the Federal government half the goddamn continent and was a huge thing because the feds couldn't do land purchase) as well as numerous other small things slowly increased the power of the federal government. Then finally with FDR's New Deal the federal government finally became a presence in the common peoples lives.

Which finally brings us to today where few people actually identify as being from a state unless pressed. The general cultural identities are mostly based on geographic region and lifestyle not state and although this does occasionally align with state coincidentally as is the case with Alaska.

2465,"I disagree, I think the spat between Italy and France is an outlier. Obviously we need urgent reform for a more consolidated defense and foreign policy arm of the EU, but the general consensus of the majority of EU states will either abstain of hold favor with Haftar. It's also important to note that the difference between Haftar and Assad is that the former is not reliant on a sole backer or bloc of support from opposing geopolitical factions. His policies, although hardline, are seen as favourable to the majority of countries who the conflict and situation in Libya affects. Whether that's anti Muslim brotherhood backing from the Saudi, Egypt bloc, or arms and defense interests from Russia. 

&amp;#x200B;

The US and Israel hold significant support over him if you consider his political ideology of post-Nasserism which looks far more favorably at these two countries as opposed to say Ba'thism or other regional ideologies. Also consdering the fact that Haftar himself lived in the US, in Virginia of all places, and has worked and is probably still working for the CIA, who among others understand the need for a strongman in the fight against rampant Islamism.

Hopefully when he does wrestle control of the country, not only will the ports and the oilfields be secure, but will also stop the funding of said Islamist organisations through their trafficking of people, and sale of said oil.

&gt;There have been a number of interesting recent studies in Germany on the subject. These have found a high risk of mental disorders among those facing the threat of over-indebtedness as well as the association of over-indebtedness with an increased prevalence of overweight and obesity apart from traditional socioeconomic factors. **Additionally, there is evidence that over-indebted persons refrain from seeking medical treatment or purchasing prescriptions even under Germany’s health system.** **One-third of participants in a study of insolvency counseling services in Rhineland–Palatinate indicated that their financial difficulties were a result of accident, illness or addiction.**   
&gt;  
&gt;A number of responses noted that medical costs are present in a growing number of personal debts. These included Belgium,  - **Page 9**

 [Article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19444774)

&gt;In the past few years, the number of over-indebted private households in **Germany has steadily increased and is currently estimated to have reached 3.13 million.** Financial difficulties culminating in private insolvencies of the persons concerned may lead to **a restrained usage of health-care services that require additional payment.**   
&gt;  
&gt;The majority of participants stated to refrain from buying prescribed medication **(65.2%)** as well as from seeking medical advice and paying euro 10.00 own contribution **(60.8%)** because of their financial situation.  

 [Article](http://www.privatinsolvenz-hilfe.org/en/german-bankruptcy-law.html)

&gt; In German bankruptcy law, from the start of the procedure until your debt relief order is issued, it takes at least six years. But this isn’t guaranteed! According to German insolvency law, up until the deletion of your record from the debt register, bankruptcy takes from nine to ten years! And that’s just if it goes smoothly.   
&gt;  
&gt; **German bankruptcy law will expose you to huge charges, stop you from being able to do business and won’t let you make a proper fresh start** 

 [Article](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/643000-bankruptcies-in-the-u-s-every-year-due-to-medical-bills/)

&gt;A ranking of causes of over-indebtedness and private bankruptcy in Germany found that **“psychological problems”** and **“own sickness”**, if added together, would rank in **fourth place** of reasons for over-indebtedness and **private bankruptcy.**    
&gt;  
&gt;Consider Canada. Our neighbor to the north features a government-run, single-payer healthcare system where private insurance is outlawed for procedures covered under the law. So you’d think that Canada would have a lower rate of bankruptcy than the United States, what with one big potential cause of bankruptcy — the cost of health care — absorbed by the government.  
&gt;  
&gt;But according to researchers at the Fraser Institute, a nonpartisan Canadian think tank, bankruptcy rates are statistically the same on both sides of the 49th parallel. In both the United States and Canada, less than one-third of 1 percent of families file for bankruptcy each year.  
&gt;  
&gt;Further, even with a socialized healthcare system, some Canadians go bankrupt because of medical expenses. Approximately **15 percent of bankrupt Canadian seniors** — those 55 and older — cited medical reasons, including uninsured expenses, as the main culprit for their insolvency.

From your own article:

&gt; This study seeks to close that gap by drawing upon medical debt and other data from consumer bankruptcy cases filed in 2013 and responses to a nationwide survey of recent bankruptcy filers. The data adduced in this study shows that medical bills are the single largest causal factor in consumer bankruptcy — but not to the degree found in the study cited by President Obama. My study concludes that medical debt is the predominant casual factor in **18% to 26%** of all consumer bankruptcies. 

And the US's bankruptcy laws are so bad that  

&gt;Following the soar in insolvencies in the last decade, a number of European countries, such as France, **Germany**, Spain and Italy, began to revamp their bankruptcy laws in 2013. They modelled these new laws after the image of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

With the US bankruptcy you get a fresh start

 **Chapter 7** bankruptcies are by far the most common. These are liquidation bankruptcies in which the debtors must turn over all ""non-exempt"" property to a supervising officer known as the bankruptcy trustee. Property is exempt if it falls within specific categories of assets that debtors are allowed to keep, such as a certain amount of clothing, household items, tools for work, and in some instances, vehicles and the family home.   
 **Chapter 13** bankruptcies offer a number of benefits besides allowing debtors to keep their property. For example, certain types of secured debt, like a car loan, can be restructured by reducing principal to the market value of the collateral, and lowering payments by extending the repayment period to 60 months. Other obligations, like mortgages, student loans, and tax liabilities can be modified as well. Creditors are given no choice in the matter.  

**So what did we learn?  Germans go bankrupt due to medical cost.  Try Google next time.**

By the way you can write medical expense off on your taxes.  Some bankruptcies are due to medical issues, but some are due to people wanting a fresh start and claiming medical is an easy solution.  Also if you tell the creditor you are filing bankruptcy the first words out of their mouth is 10 cents on the dollar because they know they will get nothing if you file for bankruptcy.",USA,/r/europe/comments/bc36sb/why_youre_more_likely_to_die_of_cancer_in_europe/ekoj1dq/,busbythomas,1555033919

The issue is that if your intention is to create such a document, why not include all parties and get complete support?

Of course, doing that would mean using the actual political system as intended, which is what they're trying to avoid. Instead, they make a deal to make sure one side gets their unreasonable policy approved, while the other side in return get their own unreasonable policy approved.

This is done because they know the policies are unreasonable enough to not pass through if using the actual political system. Just like a collusion within business.

The reasonable and democratic thing would be to scrutinize coalitions, and let every issue brought up be decided by all parties being involved in coming up with a reasonable policy together. Not to trade otherwise non-supported issues between each other.

I appreciate that this has dragged on. You're probably all sick of it; we, in the UK, are sick of it too (irrespective of what you may have voted as an individual).

Don't give up on us. The UK is more divided then ever, we need to address this and we are venting our frustrations. Recognize that we are directing these frustrations in a misguided and un-constructive way. I don't blame anyone that voted to leave, times are desperate at the moment and people were sold a promised land, but that promise was based on lies by people that have alterior motives.

The UK fought for Europe before it was a solidified concept, but we fought anyway, because we believed in a concept. That concept eventually became the EU.

Now I ask that you fight for us. We're fighting a different war sort of war, but the concept is still the same, and the stakes are just as high. Germany needed saving from itself from 1939-1945. The German people weren't bad, they we're just mis-sold an ideal. As a result of that conflict the foundations of the EU were laid, partly to ensure that history did not repeat itself. The UK is in a similar position now in that the UK has also been misguided and mis-sold an ideal. I ask that Europe recognises this and fights to save the UK from itself, before the damage becomes catastrophic.

Most states still had a strong independent identity but slowly ceded that identity to the larger collective much like the countries of the EU today are slowly identifying less as their country and more as European. 

In this analogy Texas and Britain serve similar roles both are conservative regimes with independently strong economies which are net contributers to their respective systems and a tendency to play political hardball against policies they disagree with. Both have threatened/tried to leave but have found it difficult to extricate themselves from their respective systems and most do not seriously believe that they ever will (though this seems far more likely that Britain may succeed than Texas ever will.) Finally their residents both maintain a strong identity independent of their collective far more than that of others within their blocks.

Judgements on if this is a good or bad thing is completely besides the point. I'm simply noticing that the 2 fill similar roles within their geopolitical system. I'll be the first to admit the analogy is not perfect but 🇪🇺≠🇺🇸 but the EU seems at least to me to be on a similar political trajectory as the USA was some years ago with slowly eroding member independence to a progressively more powerful central government and meny of the political tiffs in the EU can be seen reflected in USA history.",,/r/europe/comments/bbwp3r/percentage_of_population_identifying_as_european/ekoahlx/,defenastrator,1555027654

from the article, “‘As far as we recall these are already public,’ WikiLeaks wrote at the time.” this would seem to corroborate quite well with the later statement, in the same article, that “The Russian cache was eventually quietly published online elsewhere, to almost no attention or scrutiny,” implying that the “leak” was, indeed, already public; else it would have received a bunch of attention. their rationale for saying wikileaks is “run by russia” is that they didnt publish something they felt they didnt need to publish. the article states that, in the the FP source’s view, having wikileaks publish it “would have exposed Russian activities and shown WikiLeaks was not controlled by Russian security services,” trying to prove a negative

&gt;The Sunlight Foundation, an organisation that advocates for open government, said that such actions meant that WikiLeaks was no longer striving to be transparent but rather sought to achieve political goals

so the parent company doesnt like how wikileaks being used, as is explained in its own article entitled, “On Weaponized Transparency,” which states its issues with wikileaks exposing sensitive personal data on ordinary citizens, AND NOTHING RELATED TO ITS ACTUAL POLITICAL LEAKS. to turn around and say that because the parent company criticized wikileaks for an action it took, it’s disavowing and criticizing the entire thing, is extremely disingenuous. the article is drawing false equivalencies, using random anonymous sources saying that theyre scared of wikileaks’ propensity to dox people, as their headline

&gt;WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share a false claim by Assange that Hillary Clinton had wanted to attack him with drones.

so wikileaks asks for the fact that clinton joked about wanting to drone strike assange to be pushed by someone with a lot of power and would likely push it, which, turns out, he already had. you say that it’s a “false claim,” and yet nothing stated was false nor fabricated; disingenuous sure, but not false. the tweet that wikileaks asked trump jr to comment on wasnt even assange’s take, it was the literal quote from clinton herself, nothing to do with assange’s reaction to or take on it

&gt;In September 2016, the German weekly magazine Focus reported that according to a confidential German government dossier, WikiLeaks had long since been infiltrated by Russian agents aiming to discredit NATO governments. The magazine added that French and British intelligence services had come to the same conclusion and said Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev receive details about what WikiLeaks publishes before publication.The Focus report followed a New York Times story that suggested that WikiLeaks may be a laundering machine for compromising material about Western countries gathered by Russian spies.

literally all speculation and hearsay, literally no proof whatsoever to provide any veracity, other than the fact that “hurting western governments,” regardless of the fact that it’s done by exposing their corruption, is something “russia would want.” this is a classic retarded american take, where literally anything attacking or criticizing western governments, EVEN WHEN IT IS VIA EXPOSING THEIR OWN CORRUPTION, is falsely equivocated with being “from russia,” “having russian ties,” or being a “russia-backed operation” perpetuated by “russian backers,” “russian hackers,” and “russian spies;” and people take it at face value because thats the narrative thats easiest to push",Russia,/r/europe/comments/bbxvf3/wikileaks_cofounder_julian_assange_arrested/eknzq8b/,chukotkaa,1555019989
2774,"&gt;On 10 December 2016, several news outlets, including The Guardian and The Washington Post, reported that the Central Intelligence Agency concluded that Russia intelligence operatives provided materials to WikiLeaks in an effort to help Donald Trump's election bid

same as above, although this one is even more laughably dumb. reading the article, it states that, “The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.” so once again, it’s some “anonymous officials,” being “briefed on the matter,” of a supposedly “secret assessment” from “the cia.” this was published a month after the election, where, somehow, they never seemed to know all of this “SUPER SECRET INFO” before the election, only after - really makes you think. even the language itself screams that this exists to satiate boomers and stupid people looking for an explanation as to how trump got elected; this is the exact kind of fear-mongering, voluminously-void journalism that people with an iq higher than 40 have a problem with; because “russia” preferred the candidate that was less harsh on it to win, that means that they pulled some deep cover ops to “hack” the emails, which means that the people publishing it are, therefore, also run by russia. this is entirely baseless deductive reasoning, stemming from an initial assumption that literally, to this DAY, has not been proven. theyve shilled “russians hacked us” so long and so hard that people are taking it as fact. it’s astounding what telling people over and over will make them actually believe

&gt;In April 2016, WikiLeaks tweeted criticism of the Panama Papers, which had among other things revealed Russian businesses and individuals linked with offshore ties

….so wikileaks did criticize “russia,” looks like theyre not actually run by them after all. truly a shocker 

&gt;The WikiLeaks Twitter account tweeted, ""#PanamaPapers Putin attack was produced by OCCRP which targets Russia &amp; former USSR and was funded by USAID and [George] Soros"". 


i cannot find proof of this tweet existing, but ill give you the benefit of the doubt. you counter this by stating that “According to The New York Times, both Assange claims are substance-free” because the nyt says that “there is no evidence suggesting that the United States government had a role in releasing the Panama Papers,” without refuting the soros shit whatsoever - and the agency in question never said it didnt do it, the nyt is simply stating that there is no definitive proof

&gt;Assange began to host a television show on Russia Today, Russia's state-owned news network. Assange has never disclosed how much he or WikiLeaks were paid for his tv-show.

and? is anyone with a BBC show a corrupt cronie because they have a show on a state-funded tv service? the article states that, “In a written statement, Sunshine Press, which works as his spokesman, said Russia Today ‘was among a dozen broadcasters that purchased a broadcasting license for his show,’” meaning that this wasnt some RT-exclusive show, it’s just that RT wanted to broadcast it as well. disingenuous journalism obviously trying to insinuate that the show was somehow owned/created/directed by “the russian government” because it purchased the rights to broadcast it

&gt;WikiLeaks tweeted that Flynn resigned ""after destabilization campaign by U.S. spies, Democrats, press.

yes, they did, what is your point? the article is stating that wikileaks tweeted this out, then goes on for 4 paragraphs about how “The intelligence community concluded that Russia was behind the DNC and Podesta hacks, and that the Kremlin interfered in the campaign specifically to help Trump win,” once again, shilling this unfounded reasoning and going on faith that the readers will see this and think, “yeah, this makes sense. i completely trust the ambiguous ‘intelligence community’ that, in an unknown way, ‘russia’ ‘hacked the election.’” this article is entirely devoid of any substance apart from further speculation that wikileaks is “run by russians,” which i already explained the rationale to above",Russia,/r/europe/comments/bbxvf3/wikileaks_cofounder_julian_assange_arrested/eknzqu0/,chukotkaa,1555020000
2775,"&gt;In April 2017, the WikiLeaks Twitter account suggested that the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack… was a false flag attack.

yes. here is a link to the tweet: https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/849975654737227776 . watch the video and notice how it isnt saying “it was a false flag! it didnt happen!,” but rather that it was likely perpetrated by terrorists rather than the government. the use of the term “false flag” is attempting to draw the conclusion that theyre implying it didnt happen, rather than it happening in a different way. wikileaks tweeted out a video hypothesizing this, before trump made any brash decisions like bombing the government that may have not even been responsible; why is this a bad thing again?

&gt;In May 2017, cybersecurity experts stated that they believed that groups affiliated with the Russian government were involved in the hacking and leaking of e-mails associated with the Emmanuel Macron campaign

the article states that, “Vitali Kremez, director of research with New York-based cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint, told Reuters his review indicates that APT 28, a group tied to the GRU, the Russian military intelligence directorate, was behind the leak.” yet again, theyre going on faith that nobody will look deeper into this - how is this group of ukrainian hackers supposedly “tied to” the GRU? we dont know, nobody knows, they only know that they believe this group hacked macron, and because theyre an eastern-european located group, they are automatically “tied to russia,” or something, lmao. the article also says, “U.S. intelligence agencies said in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered hacking of parties tied to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to influence the election on behalf of Republican rival Donald Trump.U.S. intelligence agencies said in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered hacking of parties tied to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to influence the election on behalf of Republican rival Donald Trump.” again, with literally no proof to substantiate that claim whatsoever; they just expect everyone to believe that “the us intelligence agencies” found this to be the case, with absolutely no justification why or how

&gt;In October 2017, Foreign Policy reported that WikiLeaks had in the summer of 2016 turned down a large cache of documents containing information damaging to the Russian government.

already addressed this above?

&gt;WikiLeaks has been accused of anti-semitism.

the article states that, “Private Eye published a report saying that one of Assanges associates in Russia, Israel Shamir, was a Holocaust denier… WikiLeaks founder claimed there was a campaign by Jewish journalists in Britain to discredit the organization,” which assange goes on to state was false - he never said anything about a jewish conspiracy. there was no proof of these statements, and Private Eye goes on to say that, “it denies that Assange and Shamir had a close association.” so what we have here is an article writing a flamboyant hit piece because of a tangential association with someone, which, when refuted, turned out to be completely baseless; with even the original publishers admitting it was baseless propaganda",Russia,/r/europe/comments/bbxvf3/wikileaks_cofounder_julian_assange_arrested/eknzraj/,chukotkaa,1555020008

2836,"I take some issue with nationalism under that definition too. I think it makes sense to care more about myself or my loved ones than about others, but it doesn't make much sense to be to hold the well-being of a random fellow citizen in much higher regard than that of a random person across the border. The only reason for that would be reciprocity, as citizens of the same nation have an agreement to share resources with one another in one form or another. Therefore, if your countrymen are better off, so are you.

However, my issue is with the arbitrariness of this. Why is it okay that a rich person in my nation pays more tax than a poor person (which I 100% support btw), but not okay for my nation to support poorer nations, or harbour refugees from there at some cost to our resources?

Especially in a time where geographics matter less and less (due to fast modes of transport and especially global communications) it's bizarre to me that solidarity is based so strongly on proximity, and even weirder when the solidarity ends/strongly diminishes at a nation's borders.

Of course, one nation giving it's resources to another equally wealthy country without anything in return is silly. Reciprocity is essential. But to me, nationalism is a barrier that stands in the way of reciprocity across borders. In an ideal world, there wouldn't -be- any borders. Of course in the current state of the world they are unavoidable, but humanity coming together as one ""tribe"" seems like something we should so obviously be striving for (though not at the cost of everything) that I don't know why nationalists are, generally, so in favour of keeping borders the way they are.",,/r/europe/comments/bbq5xj/merkel_sharing_her_memes_with_other_eu_leaders/eknnp3a/,gnufoot,1555012289

But there is treatment innovation for prostate cancer and breast cancer in the USA. There is also screening and early detection for these, as well as early screening for colon cancer. When kids and young people get cancer, it seems their survival rate or the cure rate is fairly high.

In places like Greece, Spain and Portugal, where is cancer ranked as a cause of death? Thought I recall seeing it's perhaps not in the top ten?

And the US has a high rate of cardiovascular and obesity-related deaths. Had they lived 10-20 more years, perhaps cancer would have killed them.

If you knew your history, you'd know that:

a) most of the ~5000 pre-Treaty of Utrecht Gibraltarians weren't 'native' to the area either, they were largely descended from Catalans, Genoese and Jews, none of whom are native to Andalusia. Gibraltar very likely has a higher proportion of Andalusian ancestry today than it did in 1704.

b) After the British took over, the Spanish civilian population weren't 'expelled', they left of their own accord when the Spanish military left, leaving just 70 people behind. That isn't even close to an 'expulsion'.

&gt;  I am sure they are more than willing to to join a country that is not of their own.

And even if we take your flawed logic to be true, if we follow it Spain should give up Ceuta and Melilla to Morocco, because Spanish people aren't native to North Africa, so their vote shouldn't count and the people who have been living there for generations, who know no other home, should be ethnically cleansed for the sake of appeasing Moroccan nationalism.

3009,"Well of course not in the sense that she became chancellor in 2005.
When she made that statement in 2015 and suddenly was shoved forward as pro-immigration in the international view the migrant crisis had long kicked off and Merkel had done nothing personally to trigger it. Rather this came from drought on one hand, violence following a series of events part of the Arab spring and also the collapse of governments we had deals with to stop such refugees (For example Italy had a deal with Gadaffi)

The statement she made was in response to that at a refugee camp visit essentially translating to ""We have managed so many things — we will also manage this situation."" but particularly in the English speaking media misconstrued as her stating that Germany could take more.
She later regretted saying it.

Before she even made it tho she and the Dutch (I forgot to mention them last time, apologies) worked on the deal that would bring it down again.

From the NYTimes:



&gt;Mr. Salvini and Mr. Orban have cultivated popular support by creating the impression that they are the only leaders willing to make the tough decisions needed to reduce migration. Yet the European establishment, under pressure from the likes of Mr. Orban and Mr. Salvini, has been quietly working for some time with the main gatekeepers along the migration trails to Europe, including with authoritarian regimes, to bring the numbers down.

&gt;In Italy, arrival numbers plummeted after Mr. Salvini’s predecessor controversially persuaded several militias to halt the smuggling industry in northern Libya, and to keep thousands of would-be migrants in dangerous conditions in makeshift Libyan detention centers.

&gt;“The measures implemented by the previous government, which Salvini was so critical of, have actually been effective,” said Andrew Geddes, director of the Migration Policy Center at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy.

&gt;At the same time, several European governments have made deportation agreements with Sudan, whose leader, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, has been charged with war crimes charges. A deal with Niger has helped a crackdown on smuggling in the Western Sahara. And most controversially, the German and Dutch governments brokered a European Union deal in 2016 with the authoritarian government of Turkey that led to an immediate and drastic drop in migration to Greece.

&gt;“The paradox is that, in this narrative that Merkel opened the E.U.’s borders, it was in fact Merkel, with the Dutch, who negotiated the most effective agreement on the borders of the E.U.,” said Gerald Knaus, director of the European Stability Initiative, a Berlin-based research group that first proposed the deal, and that drafted early versions of it.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/bbq5xj/merkel_sharing_her_memes_with_other_eu_leaders/ekn01mx/,modomario,1554997554

3059,"&gt; Assange said WikiLeaks plans to start publishing new material starting this week, but wouldn’t specify the timing and subject.

Yes, and it was very convenient it was Podestas emails that were released at that particular time, at that particular moment -- as opposed to all the other materials that were promised on war, arms, oil, Google and mass surveillance -- to capture the news cycle, and move to focus off the Access Hollywood tape and help Trump. Assange has become a political player. This isn't about uncovering US war crimes in Iraq. It's about settling personal vendettas.

&gt; Now like others you might blabber how we (and Russian dissidents) already knew that, so feel free to share it.

Yeah, we kinda did. The latest Russia leak from Wikileaks was in 2017, and it pertained to the Broadband Russia Forum in 2013... Nothing about Putin, though. He's totally clean.

&gt; Why are you lying about things ? Assange didn't ""oppose"" the Panama papers. He fully supported its release and asked for the other 99% of documents to be released as well. He praised the work of the SZ

Then why did Wikileaks characterize the Putin leaks as 'produced by OCCRP which targets Russia &amp; former USSR' that 'was funded by USAID &amp; Soros.', when that was not true? Why make up conspiracy theories to protect Putin? Why did Wikileaks turn down a [large cache of documents related to the Russian government?](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/17/wikileaks-turned-down-leaks-on-russian-government-during-u-s-presidential-campaign/)

3062,"What I remember most from this tunnel is that it's only became profitable like 2 or 3 years ago. 


&gt;Following the restructuring, Eurotunnel was able to announce a small net profit in 2007, of €1 million, for the first time in its existence.[15][16] Half year earnings for 2008 rose to €26 million (£20.6m). The net profit for 2008 was €40 million, despite the costs associated with traffic loss from September 2008 to February 2009, following a fire in the tunnel, and this allowed Eurotunnel to issue its first ever dividend of €0.04 per euro value.[17][18]  

&gt;The return to financial health allowed the company to announce on 28 October 2009, the anticipated voluntary redemption of some of its convertible debt. By anticipating to November 2009 the reimbursement of debt due in July 2010, it aimed to issue up to 119.4 million new ordinary shares, and thus shore up its capital while reducing its debt load.[19]

3085,"&gt; Or would you just forward it to CNN, Euronews, and whoever else?

They kept talking with Wikileaks and hoping they'd publish it, which makes sense, given that Wikileaks is the biggest and most-watched platform. If you're an idealist believing in that platform's stated purpose, why would you not?

Any actual news outlet is an ""end consumer"" of such leaks; we're talking about gigabytes of text here. You need specialists to sift through all this data. Maybe the smaller size of the lesser known platforms further contributed to the delay, too.

&gt; Oh really? There are like a dozen of articles a week about it here on /r/europe. Google ""Russia Ukraine"" and you'll find hundreds of articles a week...

Are you suggesting that interest in this subject has remained on a constant high level throughout all these years, rather than waxing and waning depending on *new* developments like the Russian military seizing Ukraine ships?

Leaving aside that most of the reports you get when googling both countries aren't actually from threads concerning the conflict, but rather side discussions that arise when just one of the two countries is mentioned -- not to mention historical threads about stuff that happened a century ago.

&gt; The fact that no one did, simply shows that there is nothing worth publishing.

*Not anymore.*

And if you think there's no difference between Wikileaks and, say, CNN, then you are grossly misunderstanding each organisation's capabilities and stated purpose. Why do you think Wikileaks became a thing in the first place if people could just go to the news instead? It certainly wasn't for lack of coverage.

&gt; Wikileaks decided that only interesting information there is what is already known.

Would have been nice to let the public decide whether the info is ""interesting"" or not, given that interest in the general subject had been quite high at the time.

&gt; Where's anything like that about Russian leaks?

Oh and they also have pretty liberal ""right to die"" laws, so you can if you have a terminal condition or even just one that really diminishes the quality of your life in many cases legally off yourself with medical assistance. In context of what they have legalized, it is pretty insane that you cannot legally sleep at rest stops haha.

There is no path to Brexit that will end in anything but some level of disaster, and the question on who gets the brunt of it is the only remaining question: us or the UK. This denialism in hopes of some future deal, while giving the UK the opportunity to just up and leave, just increases the probability that it will be us. 

There was never a chance of the UK leveraging any new competative trade network after leaving, there was no danger of their competition once gone.

2. The taxi driver hasn’t had his trial yet so he hasn’t gotten off scot free. He will almost definitely go to prison after his trial is held. Until then he still has the right to work and the courts don’t have the authority to take away his license.
3. The teenager wasn’t jailed for stealing chocolate. He was jailed because he was drunk and being belligerent to both other civilians and the police.

&gt;Hi Don. Hope you’re doing well! In relation to Mr. Assange: Obama/Clinton placed pressure on Sweden, UK and Australia (his home country) to illicitly go after Mr. Assange. It would be real easy and helpful for your dad to suggest that Australia appoint Assange ambassador to DC.

It's my ideological thinking, that EU promotes European values across the world and unites countries that share these values. It is reasonable for this union to incorporate other countries, that share the same set of values and goals. If a neighbour of the EU, i.e Russia, were to be in a situation that it shares our values and our geopolitical interests align, sure they could join.

It won't happen, but it would be nice.

The size of Russia, both population wise, but mostly geographical size, will be a hindrance. Russia wants to be a great power in its own right, and compete with the EU, not join it.

&amp;#x200B;

The beauty of proportional multiparty systems (also the bane of them in someways). No one party can rule, since the political landscape is fractured.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what happened with Finns before. They didn't want to go to government even as third largest.... Next time again didn't really want to. Rest said *you come in government or loose all credibility as political party intent on ever governing.* They go in government.... have to compromise.... splits the party.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Same would happen again eventually. However this time they are even less co-operative.... So others will just refuse to work with them. Since to get that one has to be willing to compromise. Compromise is the poison of hard line populists, who get their  popularity by stating clear unwavering message. Message that is not practically implementable (atleast under Finnish constitutional and political environment), which makes for lots of bark bark bark and no bite in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course that bark bark bark is concerning in affecting public opinion. However as far as governing and actual political effect? **They are nowhere near majority**. Thus whatever they shout, they can't implement. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being largest is relative, in Finland it often means very little. The main political power is in the government negotiations and the following *Statement on the programme of the Government.* Which is actually a [constitutional](https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1999/en19990731.pdf) (Section 62) item in Finland. Not in legally binding sense, but rather Government must issue official programme on taking office. These negotiations and formation of statement is the real power play and what happens on next term in Finland. Proportions of this decides by the vote result ofcourse. However as said it doesn't go stricly on pure numbers. If others refuse to form government with someone, them being biggest is meaningless with even largest party having just around 20% of the vote.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/bbwhbg/yle_poll_finns_party_sprints_to_second_place_sdp/ekm34pj/,variaati0,1554968735

3534,"&gt;If elections were held now, the 'second vote' wanting opposition party would win outright, but that isn't being allowed either.

EU helped you on this front tonight. Macron's point tonight was that at present the chance of the deal passing is actually lower rather than higher, thus a long extension would only incentivize May to not do much in the short term at all. 

This compromise agreed tonight does two things: 1. May gets the chance to table the deal again (Meh). 2. It puts pressure on her to organize General Elections (Yay) if no majority seems likely this summer.

The downside is that for a second vote to be possible the opposition must win seats in the General Elections, which is a wild-card, and a further extension be given in the fall since the UK has that 5 month limit. But I think if GE are to happen, then it is better that the opposition combines their resources to fight the Tories than fighting for their own very different opinions on Brexit alone that hasn't worked very well so far.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/bbv7zs/brit_here_european_brothers_and_sisters_please/eklygsv/,RassyM,1554962349

* they lost two agencies to Paris and Amsterdam with the thousands of jobs associate with them

UK stays in limbo so long it's economy is basically bought out by china and barely propped up by the now-federalized EU. America is trying to woo the UK away from Europe due to utterly deteriorated relations with the EU. Story is really just a follow up to a earlier story I wrote and I thought I was being utterly unrealistic by making the UK (government) a continent-hating, politically bankrupt, economocally unviable state whose ppl are living in a augmented-reality bubble about to pop (except no one cares about real life anymore and that sets the premise). Story is not really about politics - or not primarily, as it's hard to avoid politics entirely. I just wanted an outrageous setting to set a dystopian future in, which was my premise for the earlier story too (EU is federalizing and being highly undemocratic about it - China and Russia both want to know what the EU is planning and cyberpunk shenanegins ensue). But every time I try to come up with smth outlandish, try to create a world or characters just a little too over the, I catch up with the news and feel like I'm being too tame.

I wouldn't say the house of cards was more stable; saying, ""Well, we could have glued them together if we'd have forewarning..."" does no good because it wasn't done, the initiating event wasn't anticipated. If that had been done beforehand and the house stayed fixed together while the glass clattered around, then sure, but that's not what happened.

If you're saying that high GDP per capita is what allowed the US to recover quickly and then keep on growing then why is Luxembourg not fully recovered when their people are way richer than both the US? I would expect from your statement that the poorest EU countries would have been hit the hardest by the financial crisis, but that wasn't necessarily the case. For instance, Ireland was a fairly wealthy country on a per capita basis but it got hit like a sack of bricks.

And again, I ask you what's the advantage of the tradeoff. If the ""European model"" sacrifices growth for stability and yet suffers worse from the instability of others than they do and winds up too cash-strapped to do anything, then isn't it a bad tradeoff?

Just think of it: If you stay, one half of the country will be up in arms. If you leave, the other half of the country will be up in arms. If an entire population of an advanced society ends up on polar opposites of the same rope, that certainly isn't healthy in any way, and it demands some serious and thorough introspection as to how you ended up where you are right now.

3696,"&gt;Well, he's in because the Blairism discredited and poisoned the mainline Labour views for at least a generation.

&amp;#x200B;

Nah bro. Blairism isn't discredited at all. The mainline labour views are still right there. How do you think Gordon Brown stayed in power until 2010? They're all still there. Corbyn wasn't chosen because of a nationwide shift, he was chosen because of the mechanism the labour party uses to select it's party leader. Anyone can vote for party leader and the process was taken over by a few hundred thousand activists who are by no means representative of the population. The UK isn't like Greece or France where the PASOK or the Socialist party collapsed completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, lots of the people who voted for Corbyn were even conservatives who voted for him just to sabotage the labour party. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyhow, these a weird time we're living in, aren't they? A Bennite  Labour leader hoping the Tories will do the job for him, a Tory PM  relying on him to achieve what they think is the exact opposite whilst a  certain wing in the conservative government's own ranks has embraced  the old Trotskyite strategy of ""entrism"" (i.e. joining institutions you  despise in order to tear them apart from the inside)

&amp;#x200B;

Oh yeah, this was what I was talking about. They didn't join the Labour party when they voted for Corbyn. These were like conservative voters who literally just paid 3 pounds, showed up to cast a vote for him, then that was it. There was no real entryism like how marxists used to infiltrate the labour party in the 1980s. They just showed up for a few minutes on one specific day and cast a vote. The trots were actually like taking over labour councils and stuff in the 1980s under Benn. 

&amp;#x200B;

And he's way less educated and to the left of Benn. What happened was the Labour party greatly changed the way they selected their party leader. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It's like in the US, but in the US tens of millions of people vote to chose the party leader like Trump or Hillary Clinto was. I'm talking about the vote to be party leader (candidate), not the general election vote. They had the same thing in the Labour party when Corbyn was choosen, but it was just a few hundred thousand people, and anyone could vote, and it was brigaded by lots of activists.",,/r/europe/comments/bbqlw7/mark_francois_were_either_in_the_eu_or_not_you/eklw5xv/,Sandyhands,1554957915

If Brexit is canceled, then the working class who all voted for Brexit will feel betrayed and they will feel like nobody listens to them so they will go to the far right. So the politicians in the UK have been forced to implement a brexit that they didn’t even want to do.

Holy roman empire, that's just ridiculous. Why not go for roman empire then or Carolingian empire, which it's modeled after.

EU isn't really more vulnerable too lobbyist and generally works the same as most European governments, just larger and with a broader scope. Making it more transparent for everyone in the long run. 

Paying more yes, allocating money where it's needed and makes an impact. Moving sectors accordingly after suitable infrastructure. Oh, and centralization isn't inherently evil.
Center, left, right. Looks more like most parties are positive too the EU and rising. Mostly the extremes of the spectrum still wanna leave. 

Norway, Iceland are both members of the EEA through EFTA. Implementing most EU law regarding commerce and oversight. Setting aside funding for certain grants and smaller membership fees, not the full members fee. The Swiss is a bit iffier, a bit over 100 bi-lateral treaties between the entities ensuring mutual benefits. All three are members of Schengen area, so none of them are completely independent from the EU and gladly working together.

Moving away from EU with everyone doing their own thing would end badly.

I can definitely see where you are coming from, but I think you are really underestimating the role of homogeneity in creating uniform and efficient societies, not saying it’s a good thing by any measure. 

Take Japan for example, would you say they are not a homogenous population? The way things are culturally perceived and their behaviors, mannerisms and thought processes are all very similar in a way. In Japan you sit through the public transportation without making a sound, the consideration toward others is much more palpable than the social situations you may find  in many other countries. When you begin to disrupt the balance of homogeneity there is a certain discourse that is created which brings new ideas and new solutions to the table. Europe is experiencing this exact same phenomena as more and more immigrants begin to change the dynamic of different countries.

Have you left India?

Aside from all of that you have just said it yourself. China and India are more comparable to a continent rather than a country making these two countries more analogous to each other overall than they would be compared to any other nation in the world.

3767,"Oh, it is very likely going to require filters to block repeat uploads of the same copyrighted content to prevent users from playing whack-a-mole with the platform. I don't consider this a problem, given the alternative and the situation we're facing right now -- in case you did not notice, YouTube already has a filter, it's just unfairly slanted towards the corporations.

In the new Directive, the initial claim/complaint always requires human review, after the rightholder has provided thorough documentation, hopefully stopping copyright trolls like Believe Music who abuse YouTube's sloppy ContentID to cheat creators out of their own IP.

The Directive furthermore empowers users to seek speedy arbitration via an impartial redress mechanism (in addition to access to courts) to settle disputes. In my assessment, this is surely better and more consistent than how YouTube is treating users and small, independent artists today.

As a little icing on the cake, the final version of the Directive actually seems to widen copyright exemptions in some Member States like, for example, Hungary, where satire/caricature is currently *not* covered by an exemption. However, the Directive specifically calls out ""uniform protections across the Union"". I'm assuming this will remain limited to the digital space for the time being, and that found its way into the Directive mostly for the sake of pragmatism, so that online content available in one Member State won't be treated as a transgression against national copyright laws in another.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bb864b/plurality_of_europeans_now_agree_that_their_voice/eklns70/,akashisenpai,1554950564

Again, as I see it -- and I realize there can be different opinions here -- you're spouting empty euphemism. The Nazi who decides that a hundred innocent civilians must be shot by a firing squad in revenge is morally superior to someone who kills and tortures one (or even a dozen) men in gruesome fashion? I can't accept that without some clear demonstration.

Because if I do that, the followup question is how many do I get to kill in this orderly clinical fashion before you decide I'm worse than the sick gruesome sadist? A thousand maybe? How about six million?

Do you understand how I'm worried where this kind of thinking would lead us?

Again, my only claim is that  the man who orders 100 innocent civilians to be shot is in no position to complain about how monstrous anyone else is. That's all. I'm not denying that the sadistic murder's deeds are more lurid, but killing a hundred people for no other reason than reprisal is its own kind of gruesome monstrous sadism and to me, it seems as if you're giving the Nazis a kind of pass or making allowances or excuses for them, even though I realize you don't see it that way.",,/r/europe/comments/bblffh/today_is_78th_anniversary_of_establishing_ndh/eklap79/,_kasten_,1554941050

I do think most member states will end up requiring to filter all types of content. When the parliament tried to ban it, member states disagreed so hard that they had to settle on clarifying that the directive doesn't require it, but member states can still do so if they choose.

That's not an argument against the directive though. After all, copyright filters are rampent everywhere in the status quo, and at least the directive adds _a lot_ of protections for wrongful takedowns, including banning then altogether, and ways to enforce that even outside of courts without having to rely on the platform acting in good faith.

But if you do not believe any better mechanism than a notice and takedown exists, then that's by definition the best effort possible, and thus the only thing that would be required. You cannot argue though that platforms will have to take offline legitimate content. That argument is extremely disingenuous. A ban for specifically that has been added since August.

Is article 17 perfect? No. Is it good? Depends on who you ask. But is it worth blocking everything just because of some law that _might_ have a marginal impact on users (how?)? Definitely not.

3904,"&gt;Ah, so according to you, the people who've ""killed more people than religious people ever did"" are afraid of personal real life confrontations.

Exactly. These people never confront someone alone because they are afraid of the repercussion, they always do it when they have the might of the state or the majority behind them. Their method of persecution and killing is done with state institutions and militias, and usually it's against unarmed people trying to go on and about with their lives. This is why organised killing can rack up big numbers pretty fast.

3912,"&gt; If someone who doesn't like milk singles out people who like milk and kills them because they drink milk, that that's scientific empirically verifiable proof that the person doing the killing was motivated by his hatred of milk. 

Except you're talking about motives there, which by definition does not fall under 'empirical' evidence... and even if it did, would not constitute *proof* of anything, much less this tenuous link you're claiming.

Furthermore, this is complete circular reasoning you're engaging in here. IF someone kills people because they drink milk, then that's proof they're motivated by their hatred of milk? You *must* understand that that's circular, right? You can't prove anything that way.

&gt; Therefore, I have established that A) something that actually happens in real life (i.e. milk hater killing milk lovers) B) that there's actually a link between the killing and the not believing in things the victims believed 

Eehhh no. For the sake of argument I'll concede that if you could somehow magically read a person's thoughts and establish that they *actually* really hate milk and that's why they killed milk lovers, that there's therefore a connection between their hatred of milk and their murders...

...the problem with applying that to the real world in this context is two-fold; first, you *can't* actually look into people's thoughts that way and therefore you *can't* establish this particular motive. 

And two...

...you've just proven that atheists don't kill people *because* of their atheism. Why? Because atheism is nothing more than the *lack* of belief. That's it. What you're describing is *anti-theism*; an active position of *opposition* to theism. 

You can claim that people kill because of anti-theism; it's a weak claim with little supporting evidence and a boat load of more plausible motives, but it's not impossible motive to have. But atheism? No, nobody kills because of that.

If I don't believe in unicorns, I'm not going to kill you just because you do. If I HATE people who believe in unicorns, then I *might* kill you... but I wouldn't be killing you because of my non-belief in unicorns, I'd be killing you because of my hate.

You're confusing the two.

&gt; But you are drinking black soda. 

Then replace one of them with tea. Or milk. Or anything at all. Same problem.

&gt; Singling out religious people and persecuting them and killing them for their beliefs is evidence of the fact this is atheist dogma

It takes a certain amount of trust, negociation and some black majic. You cannot be 100% just be a politician with no training in the field you are making laws for. Or vote on them.

The GFA was a major breakthrough in bringing peace in NI. It accepted there is a large community in NI who identify firstly as Irish, and recognised power sharing rights and removed the border. That has to stay. It simply has to.

The GFA, balanced against this, also recognised a second community in NI, one that identifies predominately as British. In a vote confirmed throughout the island, it equally made them commitments that it would be up to the people of NI what state they would be part of.

May is wrong on this one, as frankly is the backstop. A British Parliament should not hold unionists hostage on the altar of the English fetish with Brexit. Other than the fluke of our last GE I am sure they would have gone for a sea border. That is not meeting the spirit of our commitments to that community.

In starting this whole process, May should have been alive to our commitments to both communities, to honour the GFA fully. That could only have happened then, as has always been the case, if we stay in the CU and large elements of the SM. The backstop should have always been clear that the whole of the UK is caught up by whatever applies to NI. The EU should also have been alive to that, and is the price we should have been prepared to pay to honour the GFA.

Peace comes at the price of compromise by both sides. The situation on the island received little enough debate during the referendum.

4075,"The problem with the current model is that it benefits companies like Believe Music and their copyright trolling, and disadvantages independent artists who are not covered by ContentID due to inconsistent implementation -- you linked to one such case yourself. 

Article 13 seems to empower users and rightholders by mandating a more uniform and stricter verification of claims (are claims even reviewed manually right now?), whilst giving every single user the legal right for arbitration before an independent intermediary and, failing that, the ability to drag YouTube before the courts to achieve unblocking. I'm *fairly* sure that right now, YT can simply choose to give you the finger. (granted, they're probably still free to just delete your stuff from the platform, as you can hardly force them to provide service)

&gt;  However, this does not seem to be the case. The commision admits that automated filtering will not be avoidable.

Well, that would apply to the cases where a rightholder has already submitted the necessary information to identify the claimed copyrighted material, not the scenario that we discussed. And I think it makes sense that the exact same music video doesn't have to be reviewed by human hands again and again just because uploaders are playing whack-a-mole with the platform. At some point, automation just makes sense.

&gt; How will they defend themselves against fraudulent claims? False claims are already common today. This problem is not addressed at all with this directive.

How is it not? I believe the redress mechanism mentioned in Section 9 should apply to both rightholders *and* users.

*""Where rightholders request to have access to their specific works or other subject matter disabled or those works or other subject matter removed, they shall duly justify the reasons for their requests. Complaints submitted under the mechanism provided for in the first subparagraph shall be processed without undue delay, and decisions to disable access to or remove uploaded content shall be subject to human review. Member States shall also ensure that out-of-court redress
mechanisms are available for the settlement of disputes. Such mechanisms shall enable disputes to be settled impartially and shall not deprive the user of the legal
protection afforded by national law, without prejudice to the rights of users to have recourse to efficient judicial remedies. In particular, Member States shall ensure
that users have access to a court or another relevant judicial authority to assert the use of an exception or limitation to copyright and related rights""*

&gt; Will platforms take the risk of hosting the content of small creators? Platforms will tune the automated filtering such that the financial loss due to the new liabilities do not outweigh the financial gain due to the content from small creators... The result will not be pretty.

In my opinion, this is where the conflict with regards to maintained availability of material exempted from copyright comes into play. In essence, you have the opposing forces of Section 4 (prevention of availability of copyrighted material) and Section 7 (no prevention of availability for exempted material) that are intended to result in a balance, an equilibrium where the platform could use a filter that is ""good enough"" yet at the same time not too harsh. Note that the ""best efforts"" clause applies only to Section 4, not Section 7, so the Directive makes clear where, in this clash, the priorities lie.

It's not even a bug, it's a feature.

&gt; Youtube already has agreements with collection agencies (such as GEMA).

Isn't GEMA membership [something the creator has to initiate themselves](https://www.wbs-law.de/urheberrecht/die-mitgliedschaft-in-der-gema-eine-verbindung-auf-ewig-21564/), though? Just don't sign a contract with them and you remain the sole rightholder, enjoying equal privileges of the Directive. You can hardly blame Article 13 for some artists willingly agreeing to let someone else handle their claims.

And as mentioned (and quoted) before, Article 13 mandates claims to be sufficiently backed up and reviewed manually.

4104,"&gt; it seems more like wishful thinking to claim that the church was the first one to do that.

I meant first in the sense of being the primary driver. I suspect one can find instances of people here and there taking pity on someone poor and downtrodden, but it was the Christians who made a religion of it, so to speak. And really, if you're so ignorant about who actually built the universities, and hospitals, and welfare systems of Europe (and indeed, other countries where Christians were but a tiny minority -- e.g., India) so as to even dispute what I've said, then maybe this is not  your topic.

&gt;You mean the one based on greek scholarship?

No, what Greeks and Romans had was basically a system of competing gurus and acolytes. It's not a bad system, and worked for people as various as Pythagoras, Confucius, Avicenna, Freud (and Jesus himself). The notion of a university as developed in places like Oxford and Paris and Bologna was something different and far more universal. Moreover, for the first several centuries (until relatively recently) their primary purpose was the education of clerics. That alone should tell you something. Again, you're not doing yourself any favors by trying to deny or belittle this.

&gt;Democracy generally doesn't slaughter millions of people.

It has no problem with trans-Atlantic slavery, either -- guess who played the primary role in ending that? Hint: it certainly wasn't Greek scholarship.

&gt;And communism? Global communism never existed, it failed and ended up in another kind of dictatorship, 

Ah, the no true Scotsman becomes the no true Communism argument. Alas, it is just as flimsy an argument as it ever was. But hey, if you're willing to go that route, I can use the same tactics to try and deny any bad thing about Christianity as likewise being improper implementations, or whatever. Again, it's easy to make stupid arguments like that when it's YOUR sacred cows that are being ignored. See what I mean about those bad teachings being something ingrained in the human condition.

&gt;Not to mention, how ridiculous is it to excuse shit like the 30 years wars by saying ""others did it too""?

As opposed to ignoring the Peace of God, the strict limitations against war, and the countless efforts to mediate and negotiate a way around them?  Again, I have no problem finding lots of examples of the bad things you mention outside of religion. But pretty much the only place where I find some of the good things I've mentioned is in places where Christianity held sway for several centuries. It's no big deal to dismiss what they did now and claim we don't need religion to help the poor, or promote peace, or remind each other that there are things we should hold sacred other than money and power and the latest fashion trends. But it took centuries of work and effort to get to that point, and the church deserves credit for that.

I'm not saying the last word on the topic has been uttered, and maybe one day I'll see Christianity the way you do. But to deny -- on a site about Europe of all places -- the key role that Christianity played in making Europe special, and to hypocritically denounce religion while floating your own faith-based precepts without even apparently being aware of the irony is not something I look forward to doing. 

So if people like you are what we get once Christianity goes away, I think I'll stick with what I got.",,/r/europe/comments/bbjmwh/number_of_nonreligious_people_in_britain_jumps_by/ekka8sh/,_kasten_,1554918355

4193,"&gt; Britain didn't eventually join the war anyway, after like, I don't know, 6 days? 

They did, but because they considered attack on Belgium attack on Britain. They were entirely content with letting France and Russia do the fighting.

&gt; So France and Germany aren't Western countries?

France's impact on the war was minimal, everyone else did the fighting for them. Most Frenchmen were entirely content with Germans ruling over them, judging by the size of Resistance.

&gt; And where did you get the idea from that they wanted to give Hitler all of Eastern Europe, just because they were too indecisive to declare war beforehand?

Even after the war started they did nothing until France fell. They didn't want to fight a war. They were entirely content with someone else doing it for them, judging by how they negotiated with USSR. When Litvinov asked for guarantees that they would actually fight Getmany, they evaded the question or refused. They didn't fire a single fucking shot until Poland fell. If USSR joined the war, they would just stay at the border.

4248,"&gt;I am not against immigration, I am the descendant of immigrants myself, who came here for work. What I am against is exploitation, using foreign labour to undercut native labour. I'm opposed to it whether it happens here or in any other country.

I guess we agree to disagree on whether this is happening. As long as the companies are abiding the law and contracts struck by unions, pay lawful amounts and jump all the hoops I am for using foreign labor, especially for my country (Slovakia) but also for others. 

&gt;To what end? So companies can make profit. The need to have a mobile labour force is dictated by the need to make profit. It has nothing to do with ""disbalance"". Taking Polish workers from Poland and putting them on the other side of Europe does not make Europe more balanced. It's taking poorer workers with less opportunity and making them the lowest class in the West, when they are often over-qualified for such roles and would do better to add to the labour, infrastructure, and businesses of their own country, contributing also to the tax base.

First of all, there is nothing inherently bad about companies making profits. Second of all, it is you calling them second class, I certainly do not feel second class in Czechia, won't feel second class in Austria either.   
Nobody is worth less just because their job does not meet some abstract standard of value. I am not saying you are saying they are, just that the whole concept is absurd. You are not 'taking' polish workers, you are offering them a job and they are free to refuse it if they deem it not good enough for themselves or take it if they think it good. 

It does make Europe more balanced in a sense that for example, Slovakia has a lack of labor in manufacturing, despite some companies paying above average wage and wages continuously rising. We can cap it, say no more foreign workers and make the process difficult. Would it raise the wages? Yes, for few years, it would also limit the growth potential of the facility, hurt overall average wage growth in the countries and speed up automation and outsourcing, so we invite workers from Ukraine and Serbia. But, but, what do they get out of this? First of all, the country is not a farm and people are not cattle. You are not entitled to the lifes work of your countrymen just because you happened to be born on the same piece of land. Second, remitances, money set back for families, houses built for those money and lowering the unemployment rate. Putting all those people that you failed to employ into productive environment.

&gt;The thing I have a problem with is not immigration, but the principle of *free movement of labour*, which is related but different. This principle has been instituted for economic reasons, to make the business elites of Europe more proficient in making profit and keeping labour costs down. This is a fact and not just my opinion. You have to have a market economy to get into the European Union and they have rules that all goods and services have to be competitive in the Union; the European Union's official political ideology and goal is economic liberalisation.

It is a fact because you say so. I see. You have opinions and speculations. There is much more 'non-elite' people benefiting from it, then there ever will be of those elites. It is up to each country to regulate the companies shady practices so they would not pay minimum wages for qualified jobs. 

Also, if you are against market economy, then I think we are done here, because if you are against capitalism as a principle, then that is entirely unreasonable position altogether, so there is no point to even talk about it. 

&gt;When you have neoliberal capitalism, you have a decrease of worker's rights and an inability to carry out policies of economic nationalisation. And people are quite astute enough to realise that.

Except, unions still work, national parliaments elected by people have all the tools to protect worker's rights and their inability to do so, is not fault of FoM, unless their end goal is economic nationalisation for the sake of it instead of actually improving economic situation of the country.",,/r/europe/comments/bbchzh/mobile_citizens_relative_to_population_in_origin/ekjznri/,EEuroman,1554911623

4338,"Good points, and I think you’re right about the Scottish/English divide being more difficult to accomplish today. 


In fact, English is such a powerful influencer today that we see a lot of interference from English in modern Norwegian and Danish, alike. The Danes, especially, love to adopt English into their daily language use. Things like using “weekend” and “teenager” idiomatically, which doesn’t happen in the same degree in Norwegian.

(3) Russia can easily save face by letting the insurgents take the fall while claiming Russia never had any troops there anyway. It all depends on the circumstances. This is why it is important to let that cesspit stew for many years until even the Russians understand it is a hopeless cause.

Diplomacy is preferable, but it can only get you so far when dealing with an aggressive expansionist country, as the British and the French learnt to the Czechs' misfortune in 1938/39.

&gt;China’s social credit system is designed to incentivize lawfulness and integrity.

4765,"&gt; No it hasn't. It has intervened in European affairs, taking advantage of our struggles and pivoted themselves to global hegemony. Nothing to do with freedom. This whole fucking sentence is like directly from some patriotic American propaganda advert... 

The fact USA also acted according pragmatic political concerns is irrelevant, since every rational nation does the same. Yet people living West of the Cold War diving line were much more free than the people living on the East side. Europe was not in a good position to oppose the Soviet Union on its own. USA in very real terms guaranteed, that the Soviet Union had no realistic path to victory in a war with Western Europe. USA's ability and willingness to do this and Europe's weakness gave the USA massive leverage over European affairs, which it took advantage of. This is normal. You don't spend astronomical amounts of money and risk the lives of your citizens just to then waste all the opportunities it provides for you.

&gt; That's how it always goes under the influence of American media, capital and diplomacy. Everyone else is the bad guy. 

It's all relative, but the comparisons favor the USA. In the USA today there is enough freedom for people to get politically outraged when the President, using his legal authority, limited travel from countries designated as security threats. This was considered an outrageous act of oppression against Muslims and most news and entertainers can criticize him for it. In China over 100000 Muslims are in camps to be forcefully re-educated, access to information is controlled by the government, and the criticizing the chairman openly is a dangerous thing to do. Russia lands somewhere in the middle. From the perspective freedom and liberal values Russian and China are much worse compared to the USA.

&gt; American wars against sovereign countries are good wars (because their enemies are bad), while Russian wars are crimes against humanity (because their enemies are good).

Clearly you have selective memory then, because usually USA gets massively shit on for their wars by Europeans. Clearly their claims for waging those wars are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In the war against terrorism for example, going to Afghanistan was considered justified by most of the world, but going to Iraq was met with worldwide condemnation. Russia gets similar case-by-case evaluation, but there is more suspicion and doubt towards them. Russia and USA don't get exactly identical treatment, because their wars and ways of fighting them are different. USA especially has adapted to the 24h news coverage and aversion to large amount of friendly casualties, so their way of fighting is easier for westerners to digest.

&gt; Both are shitholes that should be gotten rid of.

Yet that is totally impossible, so let's stick to reality. The realistic option is to stand with the shithole you like the most/hate the least or start projecting your competing sphere of influence. Europe can project soft power well enough, but it lacks the will and capability to project hard power, so all it can do is complain at the sidelines and sanction people, when the big boys decide to take military action.

4786,"The EU is undemocratic and autocratic.

The first point to note is that there is nobody in the EU who is directly responsible for a constituency like they would be in the UK. You can't get pissed off with your MEP and vote them out.

This is because of the way MEPs are elected. It works on regions and what you vote for in your region is a party.

Taking Yorkshire as an example there are five MEPs. Parties run within that region and they pick five MEPs in order. The public vote for the party and the MEPs are then allocated based on their vote share.

That lack of individual ownership reduces the ability for local issues to be dealt with and it's done that way by design.

So that's a problem in and of itself however it doesn't stop there. MEPs don't make law, they just vote on it. It's the commissioner who decides on what laws get put to the MEPs.

There is one commissioner per country. They are appointed and not elected. Their stated aim is to work on behalf of the EU and not their nation.

The man with the real power in Junker. He is president of the commission. So that's the president of the unelected commission who's stated aim is to work on behalf of the EU and not their nation who is the most powerful person in the EU.

For the first time in 2014 the president of the commission was based on nomination by the pan European political parties.

The commission writes the laws that the MEPs get to vote on however it's the European Council who sets the agenda. The council Nia made up of the heads of state and it's led by Donald Tusk.

Arguably he is as powerful as Junker, although with less direct control. He is more chief diplomat, a head of state rather than a head of civil service.

Tusk has no accountability at all to MEPs. There is no election, or even a formal nomination process.

Finally there is the council. That is made up of one minister per country that has that role. They, alongside the MEPs have power over the laws generated by the commission.

If all that sounds democratic to you then I don't know what else to say! Clearly the people of each countries vote is for show. There is no real power there. Hence they are autocratic.",,/r/europe/comments/bb7z4n/eu_and_china_flags_go_together_surprisingly_well/ekj3q99/,Can_EU_Not,1554876989

These [members include](http://copyright4creativity.eu/about-us/) names such as the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org/), which has received millions of dollars from Google and Facebook. Of note is the exact matter in how this additional money (on top of smaller, existing grants, as you can verify on the EFF website itself) was transferred, for it was not in the form of donations which would have to be reported and listed as such, but rather as part of a *settlement* of a class action lawsuit where [Google handpicked the EFF as its beneficiary](http://fortune.com/2012/07/30/google-and-facebooks-new-tactic-in-the-tech-wars/).

Sufficiently shady yet?

In my opinion, this kind of kraken-like networking presents a real threat to the democratic process, undermining the activities of truly independent NGOs not made financial beneficiaries of those they are supposed to watch.

You are right though that China seems to have increased its exports there considerably in the recent years.

For Bhutan, from your own data you can see that the EU was the largest exporter of the three in question for every year back until at least 2010, except 2017 where the US increased its exports to the country from $1.87M to $33.4M dollars and taking the lead.

5080,"&gt;All it aims to do is to maintain the status quo.

By upending the dynamic between rights-holders, platforms and end-users. Seems an odd way to go about it. 
 
&gt; blocking specific copies is not what I suggest. It's literally what the law says

The directive does mention exact copies, whoever not alone. It says specific works, *and other subject matter* 

That  is clearly aimed at websites and users who will buypass simple hashing tools by slightly modifying them. So the simple hashing tools you have been convinced will be sufficient, will never suffice under the directive. Not only that, from the perspective of the rights-holders and platforms it's a step backwards. Platforms do not want any more manual review, and rights-holders are not keen on going back to the days of manually filing 1000s of © claims per day. Keep in mind they will write the guidelines for how to comply with the directive. 

In order to catch even the slightest modifications you need digital fingerprints. And those cant differentiate between legal and illegal content.  

So as people were saying for day 1. This will lead to filtering, there is no way around it. If you hold websites liable for what their users do, the websites will be more strict.  

&gt; The phrasing you are saying is a drastic change is almost a copy paste from Directive 2000/31/EC.

They're not even close. WTH are you smoking?

The old directive laid out how service providers were not liable for what their users did. The new directive is the opposite where liability is assumed, and then there are exceptions. 

&gt;u still seem to be buying into the ""platforms will be liable for infringing content"" narrative.

it's not a narrative, it's literally in the law.

True, although given by the relations between the countries at that time don't think either of those countries would side with Czechoslovakia.

5287,"&gt; Yes and we can't just postpone everything for years and years while this Brexit thing keeps dragging on.

Why not? Honestly, what would be the real damage? The markets expect and prepare for Brexit anyway, and the longer this goes on, the easier it will be for them to move away from the UK as they wouldn't be a reliant and stable environment for trade anymore. The only bad thing I can see is that getting European reforms started could become tricky. Then again leaving Ireland alone in this would immediately cause a political crisis that would leave no room for reforms.


&gt; Well UK did trigger the A50 so they inflicted it.

But we would be the ones who executed it and by doing so throwing Ireland back into the Troubles. They would indeed never forgive us for that and the Union would be weakened 


&gt; Again, if you get 3 weeks with a hard border and then gets a deal that is OK for the IRA, then it might be good for Ireland.

And if the the Leaver don't learn their lesson? Brexit is built on decades of anti-EU propaganda and executed by politicians who only have their careers and economic gains in mind. These people are ready to betray their own people in Northern Ireland and see the Union fall apart with Scotland leaping for independence. Three weeks of economic purgatory won't make them any wiser. 


&gt; To me it doesn't look like it is possible to do anything about that as long as May is PM and relying on DUP.

I don't know what that solution could be. Maybe the EU finds a way to enforce the backstop, or a Irish reunification becomes a topic again that the EU could use to their advantage. 


&gt; Yeah but if we crash them out on 12th of April they will understand it

They will just blame it on the EU. Because we refused to give them their red, white and blue Brexit. Because we made the final call to bring on no-deal.

Well, the title says: ""The EU single market is incompatible with Labour’s manifesto"" and article shows exactly that but it didn't convince me that it is necessarily a bad thing.

Several paragraphs are dedicated to EU's obsession with idea that ""the actions of member states must not distort competition"". While that is all true, I simply don't see a real problem (or alternative if we're to keep market economy on EU scale). However, final decision on what breaches that rule is left to courts, as article mentions in German example. That also seems reasonable approach to me.


Then there is sentence ""Socialist critics never argued that the EU banned public ownership."", a bit in contrast with what you claimed. 


And finally there is this sentence that is populism in it finest: ""The EU is a form of neoliberal government writ large, crushing democratic rights of peoples beneath the higher law of the market."". Laws of market are not something you can decide democratically same as you can't democratically change physical laws. You can restrict how and where they apply (like health care, national security, minimal wage, etc.) or you can simply ditch free market altogether but you can't have free market and expect it to obey democratic decisions.

&gt; 
&gt; - Russia and China in particular only increasing their fossil fuel production and polluting the hell out of everything regardless, so the European effort is pretty much wasted

Except here's the thing - even if Europe is not making up a significant part of the pollution, Europe still has to act on a global level to pressure others into cutting carbon emissions. 

However, this is a problem for these types of parties because they're typically

* Nationalist and explicitly anti-globalist, directly aiming to weaken or break up international alliances, political and commercial structures which give Europe its global influence.

* Overtly friendly towards the Russian regime, and not too keen on pressuring China either.

So their net effect on the issue climate change will still be disastrous for reasons other than their direct climate policy.

Current government consists of VVD, CDA, D66 and CU (bolded). It's economically centre-right to right, centrist on migration, slightly pro-green and slightly conservative. You might understand why the government is quite impopular with their own voters. D66 voters don't see enough green, progressive and pro-education initiatives, CDA is confused as to whether it's a far-right populist or a centrist elite party, VVD is too libertarian on economic issues (especially when it comes to business taxes) for their own voters and is holding the rest of the coalition hostage on the issue of business taxes. Why is CU still winning? Because they have a loyal, Christian voterbase which is already happy their small party has such considerable influence. They've compensated for the fact they're joining a coalition that isn't enough pro-refugees and pro-green for their voters by the fact that they've moved more to the left in rhetoric it seems.

5553,"&gt;To be honest these days with with electronic RFID tags, blockchain and SAP or it's equivalents USSR or a new alike spin off would be much more likely to succeed

I honestly don't think so : the big problem is how to ""rate"" something. The great thing about market economy is that you chose how to spend your ""ressource allocation"" freely, and if you use it to acquire ""means of productions"" and turn a profit then you get more. 

It means that the peoples and organization are under a constant and emergent pressure to deliver what peoples and organizations want, and hopefully it somewhat mirror what they need. 

Now there are obvious issues with the system (such as monopolies, what happen if you had no money in the first place, what happen if you mislead peoples on your products,...) and those are usually addressed to some degree (anti trust laws, social welfare, various agency such as the FDA,...) and there are less obvious ones which is why our laws are so big ad complex.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/bb64r7/egalitarian_sweden_getting_more_unequal_as_tax/ekgv70m/,Account235,1554817845

Obviously, I'm a remainer, but I can understand that there are many valid reasons for leaving the EU. It is far from a perfect institution. However, no one can deny the jam we are in right now. The only option is a free and fair referendum with all the facts laid out. If that happened and the result was still leave then I for one, and I'm sure many others would accept it.

Our SS division, SS Viking, was arguably the most lethal per soldier and often used in propaganda. Himmler carried the SS Viking seal for this reason, even if German. 

Sweden doesn't get nearly enough shit for how much we either contributed or looked the other way during the nazi regime. Many forget that the iron that was sold during the war which we built our now world leading economy on made up (difference in sources) more than half the entire steel and iron used in the war. Even higher percentage for the nazis. The war would have gone VERY differently, if started at all, if we just bombed our iron mines. 

Even if we sent 80 000 volunteers to fight for our brothers in Finland, we at the same time let the nazis go through our country by train (our finest ones at that) to conquer Norway.

Thus making sure nothing *crazy* happens, while EU is politically at it's most vulnerable moment. This being the election and change of watch of European Parliament.

&amp;#x200B;

EU wants the term change to go smoothly. So options are UK is out well clear before the elections or UK stays in well clear after the start of new term of Parliament.

&amp;#x200B;

Hence likely options are No extension at all (ergo UK either does 11th moment revoke Article 50 or crashes out) or extension at minimum to say couple months after July so the new Parliament can convene in peace. Round it out little and that makes end of 2019. This longer extension of course absolutely conditional on UK honoring treaty obligation to hold EU elections in orderly fashion like any upstanding EU Member state.
