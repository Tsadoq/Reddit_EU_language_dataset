137,"https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-interior-of-a-submarine-smell-like?share=1

&gt;What does the interior of a submarine smell like?
&gt;
&gt;This depends on the type of submarine, I guess. I‚Äôve never served on a nuclear one (or any big diesel-electric one, that is), but on the small german diesel-electrics. They are small - walkable space: 30m¬≤, and this includes even the space were you have to crawl into, if you are thin enough. Within this space, 22 men are living for weeks. Every spare place is stuffed with provisions, showering is frowned upon, because water is scarce.
&gt;
&gt;So the odor of a submarine (and a submariner) is a healthy mix of old sweat, burned diesel oil, bildges, cooked meals, slowly decaying vegetables (there was only one small fridge for meat), vomit (if someone is sea sick), mould, sea water, disinfection spray, coffee, overly ripe fruits, garlic (we loved that stuff), rubber and fouly smell some crew members produced in their boots.
&gt;
&gt;During snorkeling you got rid of it for quite a while, but it always crept back. The word ‚Äòrepulsive‚Äô rolls from the tongue quite easily.
&gt;
&gt;We had a saying aboard: It‚Äôs not the smell, that bothers me. It‚Äôs the numb feeling in my mouth and the burning in my eyes that does.

Tobacco smoke is probably an improvement. 

As for risk, I suppose that if you're serving on a sub in WW2, you've already got a healthy appetite for that.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/ndhdea/sailors_of_the_royal_navy_playing_cards_on_board/gyezlrc/,duisThias,1621232481

The Soviets never stopped their draft system so had a huge manpower pool that could be tapped in a relatively short time.

So while they held numerical superiority in summer 1941 on the eastern front, they could not sustain any prolonged war, and also did not plan for one.

The remains of this ancient ‚Äúcomputer,‚Äù now on display in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, were recovered in 1901 from the wreck of a trading ship that sank in the first half of the 1st century BCE near the island of Antikythera in the Mediterranean Sea. Its manufacture is currently dated to 100 BCE, give or take 30 years.

The Antikythera mechanism had the first known set of scientific dials or scales, and its importance was recognized when radiographic images showed that the remaining fragments contained 30 gear wheels. No other geared mechanism of such complexity is known from the ancient world or indeed until medieval cathedral clocks were built a millennium later.

And then the downright friendly interaction between the surrendered German pilots and the U.S Americans.

282,"Thing was, the Finnish Winter War was also *right* after Stalin's takeover and the army was in complete disarray, right after that there was an internal organizational restructuring. From this weird unorganized communist ideological level back to a proper hierarchy.

While the army was still weakened by the lack of officers and a lack of orders to engage the Germans, the structure was already properly organized.

There was a reason why the Japanese never fought the Soviets in WW2: they got their ass handed to them by this newly organized Soviet force shortly before the war broke out and were pants-shittingly terrified of them. This is why the Soviet's declaration of war against Japan was the straw that broke the camel's back to make them surrender (rather than the bombs themselves, which were a severe blow to morale but not the killing blow)",Saxony (Germany),/r/europe/comments/ndqa78/himmlers_volkssturm_1944/gyeubzx/,Timey16,1621228601
283,"I'll add that many countries in the run-up to WW2, I think, greatly overestimated the willingness of countries to come to terms.

I think that part of that was Japan winning in the Russo-Japanese War and believing that a repeat was possible ‚Äî when a better lesson might have been that Imperial Russia was in a bad state in the early of the 20th century.

I think that part of it was Imperial Russia collapsing in WW1 ‚Äî again, ditto.  This didn't indicate so much that countries would come to terms easily, but rather that Russia was in a really bad state then.

I think that part of it, once the war was actually underway, was early military outcomes that looked very favorable for the Axis.  If you're the Axis, things are looking still looking comparatively rosy for you in early 1941, if you look at what's going on:

* A combination of factors caused the Soviet Union to perform *staggeringly* badly in the Winter War, so there was a belief on the part of many that the USSR would perform badly militarily.

* Then in the early stages of Operation Barbarossa, the USSR really *did* perform badly.

* France, considered to be a strong military power, had folded up very quickly.  France had committed to war plans based on use of static defenses that relied on containing breakouts.  This might have worked in WW1, when the new technologies were the defense-friendly machine gun and barbed wire, but not in WW2, where the offense-friendly tank and aircraft were available.

* The UK's expeditionary force being forced to flee the mainland and losing most of its equipment.  While the [Evacuation of Dunkirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation) did preserve the men, most else was lost.

* While the US had a top-tier navy, its army was miniscule at the time, smaller than that of Portugal.

* The US is clearly not able to act against Germany in the immediate term (and what's more, US war plans that indicated this had been leaked, probably by a guy who disagreed with them, to the press), so Germany knew that the US wasn't going to be an immediate factor militarily, at least on land.

* The US, unlike France and the UK, is something of a military unknown.  Aside from the American Civil War fifty years earlier, and World War 1, where the US played a small role towards the end, the US had had few conflicts with major powers.  You'd have to go back quite a bit, to the War of 1812 or the American Revolutionary War to see the US fighting the British Empire.  Much US conflict would have been considered closer to European colonial conflicts, not the sort of high-intensity warfare that European powers fought between themselves.

So consider that in early 1941, the Soviet Union looks very weak militarily and history would lead many to believe that it would fold easily.

France, who was considered to be a pretty tough, major world power, with a better record than Russia, had been defeated at little cost within a few weeks.

Ditto for the UK ‚Äî the UK wasn't out of the fight, but had been forced off the continent and rendered unable to directly intervene for the time being.  And that had been accomplished at little coat.

Many of the smaller European powers have been easily conquered.

The US didn't have much of a military record against what Germany at least would consider serious wars.  And there was a lot of domestic political opposition to entering any war prior to Pearl Harbor.

Really, if you're an Axis power, the only sour note by mid-1940 that might have been a warning is Japan losing to the Soviet Union at [Khalkin Gol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Khalkhin_Gol) in 1939.

By late 1940, Germany had lost the fight for air superiority over the UK, but that was mostly a British defense.

In 1941, things did start to sour.  Italy had to be bailed out by Germany [in Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Greece) and [North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_campaign).

1.	 There's a shortage of vaccines right now. Everyone is waiting for their turn. What your government has promised is their job to hold up.
2.	""Next 14 days are crucial"", you offer no context for this. Either way, I believe you know that if 14 days would have solved covid, we would have done it already. Even [New Zealand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_New_Zealand) which had a great response to covid still have cases going on.
3.	Two shots will make you immune for at least 6 months. That has been known since the trials for the vaccines. If you vaccinate and the rest of the world doesn't then the numbers won't go down. Israel is vaccinated by 60% already and they have opened up. It's to be expected that once the majority of the people have been immunized against covid life will return to normal. But we're not 1000 people worldwide, not a million, but 7,5 billion. That's a lot of potential hosts given that we're at 150 million infected worldwide currently.

Israel wants to maintain a Jewish majority and control over Palestine for territorial integrity reasons.

So they have 3 options 1) A democratic state in which they are not the majority 2) A non democratic state in which different citizens have different rights 3) ethnic cleansing. The last 2 are illegal under international law so...I'm going to bet on the first one. I don't know if there are people in Israel willing to enact ethnic cleansing on the Palestinians, I hope not. What I know is that the international community will react negatively to that. Israel is loosing its strategic role in the region and among younger generations in the states support for it as an ally is diminishing. They are not supported by any other relevant super power.

Under some of the key rules, a blockade must be declared and notified to all belligerents and neutral states, access to neutral ports cannot be blocked, and an area can only be blockaded which is under enemy control.

‚ÄúOn the basis that Hamas is the ruling entity of Gaza and Israel is in the midst of an armed struggle against that ruling entity, the blockade is legal,‚Äù said Philip Roche, partner in the shipping disputes and risk management team with law firm Norton Rose.""

All that happens while the EU pisses around and takes its time is these countries go to much-faster acting China or Russia, which might one day lead to their being a Chinese military base in Serbia, for example.

629,"&gt;Large segments of the Nazi Party, particularly among the members of the Sturmabteilung (SA), were committed to the party's official socialist, revolutionary and anti-capitalist positions and expected both a social and an economic revolution when the party gained power in 1933.[47] In the period immediately before the Nazi seizure of power, there were even Social Democrats and Communists who switched sides and became known as ""Beefsteak Nazis"": brown on the outside and red inside.[48] The leader of the SA, Ernst R√∂hm, pushed for a ""second revolution"" (the ""first revolution"" being the Nazis' seizure of power) that would enact socialist policies. Furthermore, R√∂hm desired that the SA absorb the much smaller German Army into its ranks under his leadership.[47] Once the Nazis achieved power, R√∂hm's SA was directed by Hitler to violently suppress the parties of the left, but they also began attacks against individuals deemed to be associated with conservative reaction.

&gt;When asked in a 27 January 1934 interview whether he supported the ""bourgeois right-wing"", Hitler claimed that Nazism was not exclusively for any class and he indicated that it favoured neither the left nor the right, but preserved ""pure"" elements from both ""camps"" by stating: ""From the camp of bourgeois tradition, it takes national resolve, and from the materialism of the Marxist dogma, living, creative Socialism""",vi veri universum vivus vici,/r/europe/comments/ndp7lc/germany_vows_zero_tolerance_for_attacks_on/gyd20dj/,FebrisAmatoria,1621196094

You also have no idea what it means - ""effficient"" doesn't exactly mean what it means in the colloquial sense, in the sense you think it means - it doesn't mean a ""good"" outcome will always happen. ""Perfect efficiency"" is theoretical concept for modelling - a Pareto optimal equilibrium. Nobody claimed such a thing about the real world, nobody ever does or did. And of course it's **utterly and completely irrelevant and immaterial** to the point I was making. 

One of the mark of the new class of illiterates is that when faced with the factual success of market systems - see China since the 80 vs pre 80s, or West Germany vs East Germany, or North Korea vs South Korea, or what countries like Sweden, Australia, New Zealand or Canada did in the 80s, or Venezuela this century etc - is the constant resort to the strawman ""but market systems don't create perfect outcomes"" - as if anyone claims such a thing or as if that was possible.",,/r/europe/comments/nczmfa/pfizer_avoids_taxes_via_the_netherlands_and_makes/gybsupl/,MosayoPosayo,1621175368

989,"First of all: This is not about LGBTQ+; on the contrary, the study seems to pretend that everyone involved is cis-gender. (Which is fair, given that they looked at 3 million pairs the amount of non-cis-gender people would be minuscule, for the purpose of the study, even if we assume that 10% of the population was somehow not cis-gender.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, even your example doesn't show what you think it shows.

From your link:

&gt;We are investigating the concerns raised and an editorial response will follow the resolution of these issues.

This response exists, yet you have decided to not link to that. To quote from that:

&gt;They\* supported previous criticisms in relation to the use of co-authorship as a measure of mentorship. Thus, any conclusions that might be drawn on the basis of co-authorship may not be automatically extended to mentorship. The experts also noted that the operationalisation of mentorship quality was not validated in the paper.

\*three independent experts (so not a raging Twitter mob)

&amp;#x200B;

So to make it clear: The study measured the impact of ""co-authorship"" and was written as if they had measured the impact of ""mentorship"". Long story short: if I had pulled something like that during my master thesis, I would not have a master's degree and rightfully so. Your method has to match your findings.

If you read through the introduction of the study you will see that there is an awful lot of guessing done. That is to a certain extent fair game. We can't know everything and of course, we need to assume a lot, especially in sociology. Still, I can't take topic A and just extrapolate that to topic B. (Even if they are very closely related to each other)

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding Twitter: Yes, Twitter is generally toxic and even the best intentions will turn to shit on Twitter. That is inherent to the platform. If you are severely limited regarding the length of your texts, while the platform's algorithm is set to maximum engagement, all that is left is shitstorms.

&amp;#x200B;

So just for future examples: If the best you can do is showing idiots on Twitter, I will ignore it because Twitter is meant to breed idiotic group responses and therefore will always do that. Regardless of how the group identifies. That is not to say that Twitter doesn't have serious problems, but those are problems with algorithms and the impact of those algorithms on our behaviour.

1072,"&gt;Ok, I read more about the Carmiel situation - it doesn't ban Arabs and doesn't ban Arabic 

It doesn't ban Arabs NOW, but when arabs wanted to settle there, they were denied and  then your whole argument of ""but the town is just jewish, there isn't arab population there"" is not only factually wrong, but completetly ignoring and whitewashing history and the reasons for that. It does not ban Arabic, but TRIED to ban Arabic and this isn't something that happened like 30-40 years ago, it happened 2 years ago. But of course for you that means nothing, no harm done there.

&gt;regardless of how many anti-semitic tropes you can take out of your ass.

When you don't like something, scream ""anti-Semitism"". That trope is pretty overused already and doesn't work. Also, pretty rich for a person defending anti-Semitism towards Palestinians.

Unlike in Europe due to Islamphobia - we do learn Arabic in our schools

The fact that you don't only count all of Europe as one coherent thing, but assume all that (Islamophobia everywhere and Arabic isn't learnt) is very racist if you aren't aware. Arabic is learnt in Europe and there are Arabic schools if there is demand for that, even in countries where Islamophobia is still widespread, but of course by saying ""Europe"" as a whole and lumping all countries together, now  you can cherry pick a country and case where that is not the case and say ""see! here!""/

Educate yourself more on Arabic and muslim schools in Europe before assuming things.

&gt;Now before you go on to your anti-semitic rants about how we are racist because Arabic is only taught in primary school and not secondary school - students have the option to learn Arabic - and a significant percentage do. I personally chose not to but many of my friends took it in high school as their electives and can speak it (near) fluently.

Leaving aside the banal ""anti-Semitism"" remark, rest of it good information. It makes but one wonder, why then is it so hard for people to have Arabic school in a town where there is population and demand for it? 

The issue you are are speaking it's banning Arabic from their schools, by Israeli law, the education of high schools is federally dictated

Because you don't seem to grasp what the problem here is:

The issue I am speaking of is this thing even happening, reaching highest level of local politicians and being approved by them. If this thing happened in western country, those people would have been out of office due to protests in less than a month.

Same issue with the acceptance of that basic law. Can you imagine similar law even being *proposed* in Germany? A law that only true and pure germans of christian faith are the only people with right of self-determination in Germany. There would instantly be massive protests around the country. If the proposal was from the ruling government, it would be out of office in no time. The proposing party and person will instantly be under heavy investigation and prosecution for promoting and proposing fascist ideals. We are not even talking about the PASSING/acceptance of this law by the Bundestag. That is impossible. Even if it happened, all countries around it and their leaders will instantly meddle about the fascist road that Germany is taking. It would make major news and be non stop the talking topic in the media and among the people.

While there indeed was some backlash world wide against this law and some in Israel itself, but nothing really that major.

&gt;I agree this a difference between us - in Europe if you are an arab there are no publically funded Arabic schools 

This is factually wrong and of course depends on where in Europe you are talking about. Stop lumping so many different countries and people as one things, that's racism.

I can however give you a very good example for you, that even fulfill your Islamophobia desire. I am from Eastern European country that was rule for 500 years under the Ottoman Empire. So because of history and nationalism, there was and still is popular disdain about turks and Islam. Even in such a country, there are 3 ararabic schools - a Lebanese one, an Iraqi one and a Palestinian one. The Iraq one is the public  and private one, the other two are private. Everyone can enroll in those school, be it arabs or natives or other ethnicities. The private ones while being private as also very affordable. Besides these schools, there are some ""normal"" schools  that offer Arabic language as a course.

All that for a grand total of less than 12 000 arabs in the country and that number was even less when those schools were established. So in this poor eastern european country with bunch nationalists and racist, there can be 3 schools for arabs, when arabs are less than 12 000, but in a land where Arabs are natives, they can't get a single school for a population of almost 3 000 in that town?

&gt;you are forced to study in a public European school - where the main language taught there is the native European language.

You are forced to get education in Europe yes and for that there are public schools. Your analogy and comparison here is false, because the relationship between the Arabic people in those countries and the land/country, and the relation between Arabic people and Palestine.

Here is a better analogy: There is a difference between a Kurdish school in Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria and a Kurdish school and teaching anywhere else in the world.

Now of course, I am not saying that as the Arab population continues to grow and more and more become natives to the Europeans countries, that there shouldn't be more and more Arabic schools opening. However, for the amount of people that there are here now, the countries provide not only enough education, but fund plenty of schools and organization of the respective foreign cultures and ethnicities, be it Arab, Japanese, Chinese, Russian or etc.

Furthermore, even if Europe is not great on this, I don't know why you are trying to use that as a gacha moment against me? You assume that I am automatically approving the state of things in Europe, even when they are shitty? No, but unlike you, I will show my disagreement with the state of affairs, be it in my shithole home country or in another European one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Unlike here in Israel where we reject this apartheid thinking - 

Best joke I have heard lately. Obviously you totally ignored the links I sent :)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Nah - you just did that to Jews. That's the irony of this whole debate - what happened to Palestinians is a ant to what you Europeans did to us to Europe. You didn't just resettle us you murdered us like sheep - a nation drunk with the blood of Jewish blood and whose anti-semitism became part of their culture - depending where in Europe, they refuse to recognise the ethnic cleansing and genocide of Jews and refuse to give back property of murdered Jews (ie Lithuania, Poland ect)

Now, you are again lumping all Europeans as one, view them as one, consider all their history as one and assign all attrocities of some of them to all. Please keep showing your blatant racism.

Let me give you a tip, only because attrocities, racism and genocide have been done to your people and ancestors, that does not give you a free genocide and racism card to do it yourself. 

The fact that you even think and wrote this preposterous sentence:

&gt; what happened to Palestinians is a ant to what you Europeans did to us to Europe

shows that you are just another fascist supporting and excusing ethnic cleansing and genocide and of course minimizing and whitewashing them.

Should have stated with saying that you don't care about Palestinian lives and that they don't matter to you and that they are lost and/or ruined.

1203,"&gt;No, you have. Multiple times.  


No.

&gt;Borders move. Take a look at the aftermath of WWI and WWII.

Is this supposed to be some kind of gacha moment and justification?

Even the fact that you are equating Israel's territory grabbing with Europe's wars shows your lack of understanding of the conflict. If you want a comparison about the territories, do it with the british, spanish and other colonizers in North and South Americas. But hey, they fought wars and the indigenous populations lost the wars after all, so it was just proper for them to lose their homelands and to be genocided like it is happening with the Palestinians by the hands of Israel, right?

If you say no to this last question, then you are whitewashing what Israel is doing in the region and changing history.

&gt;No. Poor to just assume an argument. Which I think is a major problem for you. That and your ignorance.

What? You just did though. You justified border movements due to wars and gave WW1 and WW2 as examples, which all involved imperialism and population resettlement. Are you going to whitewash this history too?

&gt;You don't have to use inhuman imagery when discussing people.

  
I am discussing history and current time, not just people, nice try to oversimplify it. Whether you like the reality of history and of current time or not, is your problems. People are dying, kids are dying, losing their homes, evicted from their home, forced to resettle by an authority that is not even theirs that is conquering their land and seizing all natural resources and borders and putting them in basically open air prisons.

&gt;Why would I do it? A secret cabal of Jews is paying to promote their interests, right? Dullard.

  
No. You keep equating the Jews with Israel and equating the deeds of the Israeli government with ""jews"". Stop being disingenuous, this is false comparison, it only shows how racist you are.

&gt;Why do you keep repeating this obvious sentence as if it is relevant or interesting? 

  
Because you keep doing it, because you don't get it as it is obviously not ""obvious"" to you. Now  you are even going to whitewash your own comments, even this exact one, where you are equating ""Jews"" and the jewish people with Israel and the Israeli government. 

&gt;  
You weird anti-semite. 

Me pointing out how you are being anti-Simetic by using the above logic does not make me anti-Simetic. I really have to start counting how many times per comment you are trying to make me out as anti-Simetic out of your deranged interpretation and mind.

&gt;You just happen to want the only majority-Jew in the world destroyed.

Haha, no, and funny how you are whitewashing your comments again. Now it is the ""only majorly-Jew in the world"" and not ""THE JEWISH STATE""? Good to see that you are finally starting to change your racist opinion a little bit, but it would have been fine if it wasn't in such disingenuous way to try to pull out of thin air that I want some state destroyed.

If by ""destroyed"" you mean that I want a state created where both jewish and palestinian people can live in peace, as equal people, and vote and participate in the government of the state, that represents both (and all other) groups, then yeah, I want it ""destroyed"" if you can consider the implementation of this change could be interpreted as current day Israel having to be ""destroyed"".

&gt;Then don't say American is a race, you dunce.

I didn't you dunce, you just keep ignoring what I said and keep screeching your delusions.

I ignored it because it was boring and stupid. Lmao  
  
No, you ignored it, because it is not convenient for you, as you have been doing right from the beginning from your responses to the first guy.

You either flat out ignore stuff that you don't like that are good arguments against you, or you try to twist those arguments about something totally else to derail the topic, like you did with my US example and talking about ""american race"" when it has nothing to do with the argument.

Which country are you from?  
  
Why does it matter though? And if you wanted so much to know, you could have figured it out already.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;LOL. You have substandard English but I appreciate you are trying your best.

  
No, I don't believe I have substandard English :)  However, you are reaching new lows here. Insulting someone on their level of English as second language. This shows that not only that you have no other arguments/rebuttals left, that you start griping at someone's language level, but that you are trying to derail the topic, once again, for one more reason made up by you that is irrelevant to the topic. 

And then you have to add the whole act of making fun of a non-native speaker about their English/second language, which makes you an .... asshole, if I have to say it in the least offensive way possible.

&gt;So you chose to use a non-standard definition. Haha  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Non-standard of definition of what? I was talking about your reasons for defending the fascist Israel state.

No. They promote tendentious nonsense.  
  
No, they provide truth about the situation. You burying your head in the ground, because it does not fit your world view, does not change reality.

&gt;Utter cowardice. You are a coward. You know as soon as you write your definition of apartheid I will destroy your argument. You are a fearful wretch. Do it, coward. Stop making excuses.

Haha, I am a coward? Said by the guy that straight up ignore not only whole arguments of my post, but even the ones you read you decided to twist them and talk about stuff that is not related to them at all to shift the topic from them.

You will own nothing, because the international definition is right there in the wiki page, stated clearly by the international agencies. It doesn't take more than 1 minute to find it. You are just too lazy. I am not doing your work for you.

By the way, nice that you have started with the insults, or well, ramping up the amount and type of insults.

&gt;Coward. Timid little boy  


More insults, nice argument. Not my problem that you are lazy to read.

&gt;All true. You are a racist coward.



More ad-hominens and 0 arguments.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You are a coward who refuses to write out even a definition of apartheid. Lmao. You are an intellectual coward.

&amp;#x200B;

I gave you the definition of apartheid, you just refuse to read it. There is no reason for me to ""write it"", when I have already given a link to its international definition.

And again, more ad-hjominems and 0 arguments.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Except you can't even type out a sentence saying what apartheid means. You are a racist coward.

&amp;#x200B;

Except that I don't have to ""type it"", because I have already given it. I have even given real data/examples of the apartheid situation and measures in the region that are done by Israel, but you refuse to read.

And again, ad-hominens and 0 arguments.

At this point, 90% of your comments is plain ad-hominems and ""RACISM/ANTI-SEMITISM"" screeching and not any arguments and I don't see a reason to continue this discussion.

&gt; No mate, British culture has changed a lot over centuries, the changes we are talking about can happen in decades.

British culture too has changed a lot over the last decade (again, same as in my country). Trying to make a culture remain unchanged is an almost impossible task. And I do not see British culture being replaced any time soon. Do you?

Paper retraction is a very rare thing in science. It happens only if there is fraud or the authors find the the experiment/data was completely bunk due to an error. The paper was retracted because the ""interpretation was false"" (which in itself is dubious but let's assume it was indeed the case) that never happens as a reason for a retraction (if the interpretation is false, other authors may write a comment or simply a new paper that reinterprets the data).

1413,"Oradour-sur-Glane, a village in Haute-Vienne, France, was the site of a particularly brutal atrocity - albeit a common occurence on the Eastern Front in occupied USSR - during World War II. The entire village was destroyed and its inhabitants killed by German troops (Waffen-SS) on June 10, 1944.  
  
In reprisal for Resistance attacks, an SS detachment of 200 men routed all 652 inhabitants from their homes and into the village square. A search for hidden explosives and an identity check were announced, and the people were herded off‚Äîthe men into barns and the women and children into the church. 

The troops then barred the doors of the barns and the church, and with dynamite and incendiary devices they set fire to the entire village. Anyone not suffocated or burned to death was killed by machine-gun fire and grenades, except for 10 people who somehow survived the fire and feigned death until the SS had departed.

The death toll was 642: 245 women and 207 children in the church and 190 men in the barns. Postwar efforts to bring the SS men to trial were hampered by the difficulty of locating and identifying the Germans, many of whom had been subsequently killed in action, and by legal complications. Finally, in 1953, 21 of the 200 SS men were brought to trial. All but one were convicted; five of them received terms of imprisonment and two were executed.

A new village was built nearby after the war. President Charles de Gaulle ordered that the ruins of the original village be maintained as a permanent memorial and museum.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/ndg9r5/burned_out_cars_and_buildings_are_all_that_remain/gyahjan/,filosoful,1621139088

Polish communists were struggling to find a support and legitmisation in the eyes of the Polish population. In the first period they didn't persecute the Church (for example every unit in their army had a chaplain) and were also celebrating prewar public holidays, like 3rd May or the independence day on 11th November, alongside typical communist holidays like the anniversary of Bolshevik revolution of 1917.

1616,"&gt;No, I didn't. But Israel thinks that it should and acts as such. So hard to understand this?

No, you have. Multiple times. 

&gt;What happens? Come on, please spell it out? :) 

Borders move. Take a look at the aftermath of WWI and WWII.

&gt;You are going to justify imperialism, colonization and population resettlement, aren't you?

No. Poor to just assume an argument. Which I think is a major problem for you. That and your ignorance.

&gt;This is how Israel treats them, sorry that the truth is hard for you to swallow

You don't have to use inhuman imagery when discussing people.
 
&gt;You really cry anti-Semitism for everything, my god, even though you are committing it yourself. 

Why would I do it? A secret cabal of Jews is paying to promote their interests,  right? Dullard.

&gt;Not all jewish people are Israeli you racist.

Why do you keep repeating this obvious sentence as if it is relevant or interesting? You weird anti-semite. You just happen to want the only majority-Jew in the world destroyed.

&gt;&gt;""American"" isn't a race. Are you really this dim?
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;So what? 

Then don't say American is a race, you dunce.

&gt;You again very conveniently avoid and totally ignore arguments that are inconvenient for you. Why did you skip over the Chinese and anti-Sinoism example dude? 

I ignored it because it was boring and stupid. Lmao

&gt;Oh right, because you are full aware of what I mean and what is going on, but you just want to keep blaming someone in anti-Semitism when there is none

Which country are you from?

LOL. You have substandard English but I appreciate you are trying your best.

&gt;I called it nationalism because it is the most probable reason for why anyone would defend Israel's actions.

So you chose to use a non-standard definition. Haha

&gt;You are very much just cherry picking not only what to read but what to mention and what to consider as legit source. Obviously you don't like those sources as they are showing you the brutal truth about the situation

No. They promote tendentious nonsense.

&gt;&gt;Again. What you should do is state the definition of apartheid and then how Israel meets that definition. Why do you find it so difficult?
&gt;
&gt;The official international definition is stated in the wiki article that I posted, if you actually bothered reading and stopped ignoring stuff that is inconvenient to you, then that is not my problem. I will not be your babysitter here and cherry pick everything for you. I provided the links, go read, if you don't want, then you kindly fuck off.

Utter cowardice. You are a coward. You know as soon as you write your definition of apartheid I will destroy your argument. You are a fearful wretch. Do it,  coward. Stop making excuses.

&gt;&gt;So a people is indigenous to a region. If a person leaves that region and a descendant returns, are they still indigenous?
&gt;
&gt;The answer to that is again in the link that I provided in the other comment.

Coward. Timid little boy

&gt;Keep trying to make up more and more stuff to try to label me as racist, not going to work :)

All true. You are a racist coward.

&gt;""Far too long"" but of course, because you don't like reading at all and I have detailed my arguments and responses

You are a coward who refuses to write out even a definition of apartheid. Lmao. You are an intellectual coward.

The houses were built by Jordan for them under an agreement with the UN but Israel annexed the West Bank before the houses could be registered in the families names. The families successfully argued the houses belong to them until 1970, when a law was introduced stating that Israelis people who lost property in 1948 can reclaim it. The Knesset Committee of Israel claimed they owned the land since 1885 despite several families having evidence they bought the land from the Ottoman Empire, before Israel even existed. Despite this, the properties have been deemed to belong to Israelis and not the Palestinian occupiers which is why they're being evicted.

As you can see, it's far more complicated than just not paying rent.

The holocaust - the systematic extermination of European Jews - which included the murder of 80 percent of all Jewish children, changed this.

That's why I think the political imperatives are against it.

For our struggle against the Jews is extremely wide-ranging and grave, so much so that it will need all the loyal efforts we can wield, to be followed by further steps and reinforced by successive battalions from the multifarious Arab and Islamic world, until the enemies are defeated and Allah's victory prevails. The time will come until Muslims will fight the Jews and kill them  
  
or chapter 22:  
  
\[Jewish\] wealth \[permitted them to\] take over control of the world media such as news agencies, the press, publication houses, broadcasting and the like. They stood behind the French and the Communist Revolutions and behind most of the revolutions we hear about here and there. They also used the money to establish clandestine organizations which are spreading around the world, in order to destroy societies and carry out Zionist interests. They also stood behind World War II, where they collected immense benefits from trading with war materials, and prepared for the establishment of their state.

I think this is a bit unfair.  As an outsider my take on it was that most mainstream British media was fairly skeptical of brexit and that it was the tabloids propping up the lies with a Euro-skeptic point of view.  Obviously publications like the Guardian and Independent are going to have solid biases but it took me seconds to find an example of Sky calling out Johnson on his lies:

https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnsons-almost-defensible-fib-of-163350m-for-nhs-11041538

As far as getting the news from the horse's mouth, Germany in particular has pretty solid English language news (Die Welt, Der Spiegel).  Spain as well (although their media tends to run more right wing).  France, predictably, takes issue with the English language.

However the UK's Furlough Scheme and the USA's sending stumulus cheques to everyone proved this wouldn't be what happened. What did happen was those who didn't need the money didn't spend it but instead saved it or invested it in the stock market and/or crypto.

I argued plenty in detail mate. Do you want me to write double the wall of text?

&gt;Mentioning one thing isn't listing several things. Jesus fucking Christ.  


Now you are arguing semantics because you lack an argument. Yeah sorry for not using a/the word that will be explicitly correct for your taste, mister English teacher. I used ""listing"" because you listed several things, at least that would have also been the correct word to use in my native language, you pedantic sematic snob.

&gt;Not just easy, also true.  


So you are excusing enforced colonization that drives the indigenous population out of their homes and then claiming those home as theirs and justifying the murdering of any civilians who want to defend their homes?

I mean, that makes you fascist, you realize that right?

&gt;Can you please learn English, and come back when you actually speak English?  


Can you use your brain even a little when reading something to understanding it, even if there is 1 missed word in there? But nice way to derail from the topic by being pedantic.

&gt;You just call me fascist or whatever and that's that.

I called you fascist because you were defending Israel against the label, which it truly has and tried to derailed the topic with whataboutism about China, Indonesia and what not. 

You going on those leaps and bounds to defend Israel shows that you support its fascist regime and existence.

&gt;The video you posted doesn't negate the stupid point/sentence you wrote:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
You can accuse many if not all Israeli administrations of a whole lot of crimes and even atrocities, sure, *I wouldn't mind the use of the N-word per se;* **but that doesn't make Israel ""a terrorist state""**

Everyone before that ""but"" loses meaning. You can't say that you wouldn't mind using the N-word for Israel and then claim that it isn't a terrorist state. If you really think that then I don't know what your understanding of nazi and/or fascist states and terrorism is. You think they are mutually exclusive?

&gt;Which part then? You fail to make a coherent point to back up your accusations. You may find that cute, ""mate"", but you're really just insolent and out of your depths.

Which part? I am out of my depths? You are the one acting like enlightened centrist trying to ""both side"" with situation. There is no ""both siding"" this conflict. The two sides are not equal.

‚ÄúA report, titled ""Intolerance, Prejudice and Discrimination: A European Report,"" conducted by Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, a think-tank affiliated with Germany's Social Democratic Party, in April 2011, revealed high levels of antisemitism in Italy and a strong presence of antisemitism that is linked with Israel in a form of criticism of Israel. The study found that 37.6 percent of Italians believed ""Israel is conducting a war of extermination against the Palestinians"". More than 40 percent of Italians believed ""Jews try to take advantage of having been victims of the Nazi era"", and more than 25 percent of Italians agreed with the statement: ""Considering Israel's policy, I can understand why people do not like Jews"".[22]

According to the Milan-based Center for Jewish Documentation's Observatory on Anti-Jewish Prejudice, in 2012, antisemitic episodes almost doubled in Italy against 2011. Observatory researcher Stefano Gatti has said: ""The data shows the situation is changing, evolving negatively [...] The boom might be due to more efficient data-gathering, but the episodes have undeniably increased"".[23] According to a poll from the ADL released in March 2012, antisemitic attitudes in ten European countries, including Italy, remain at ""disturbingly high levels"": 61 percent in Italy has responded ""probably true"" to the statement, ""Jews are more loyal to Israel"" than their own country; 39 percent has responded ""probably true"" to the statement, ""Jews have too much power in the business world""; 43 percent has responded ""probably true"" to the statement ""Jews have too much power in international financial markets""; 48 percent has responded ""probably true"" to the statement, ""Jews still talk too much about what happened to them in the Holocaust"". Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director, has said that ""The survey is disturbing by the fact that anti-Semitism remains at high levels across the continent and infects many Europeans at a much higher level than we see here in the United States"".[24]‚Äù",,/r/europe/comments/nctfzn/livorno_dockers_do_not_intend_to_load_weapons_on/gy7gzgg/,Scamandriossss,1621080897

&gt;  
&gt;Who cares for how many people are fully vaccinated when there are no new cases?  
&gt;  
&gt;The first jab is already so powerful that it keeps the newly infected numbers down.

I think you missed the point. Yes one shot is already useful to protect people and yes we learned that a delayed second dose allows to reach a higher percentage of population. My point is that since you need to do second doses as well (because medical directives) an observer looking only at the % of half vaccinated people may be mistaken to believe the campaign to be further ahead of what it is.

Let's say we have countries A and B. Both have 20M population and both are able to do 5M doses a month. Country A does second doses after 2 weeks, country B does after 4 weeks.

A month after the start of the campaign, country A has 2.5M citizens fully vaccinated, country B has 5 million half vaccinated and 0 fully vaccinated. An observer looking only at the number of ""at least 1 shot"" may be mistaken and think that country B is ahead, since it did 25% of its population in a month it may do the rest 75% in another 3 month, while the second one did only 12.5% and will require 7 more months. Right? Wrong, the two countries are going at the same pace and will both take 8 months in total to complete.

Country B is probably going for a smarter strategy since delaying the second dose allows to reach more population faster and will indeed save lives with this srategy, but isn't progressing faster, it's just optimising its resources.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/nc35fa/germanys_vaccination_drive_keeps_breaking_records/gy77yvl/,Loner_Cat,1621073489

Support for independence in polls has changed substantially in the last ten years.  

Polling prior to the first referendum had shown support for independence varying between 32 and 38%. 

Support grew through the campaign to a pre-ref high of slightly above the actual result of 44.7% it then slowly fell to around 40% by 2017. 

Since then support has slowly climbed and since early 2020 has been consistently slightly higher than support for the union. 

A change over ten years from a consistent low of 32%-38% support to a consistent high of 48% support isnt anything like the perpetual 50/50 split that you‚Äôre claiming. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_on_Scottish_independence

There is no evidence at all whatsoever to support your argument that polling will continue to be a 50/50 split indefinitely. 

Not that anyone even needs to look at the actual polling to know that you‚Äôre wrong. 

Your claim that the balance of public opinion will stay the same forever is obvious shite. 

Pretty obviously it could change either way or stay the same. 

If you were looking at long term trends then I‚Äôd say because support has increased as much as it has in the last ten years (especially among younger voters) suggesting the next ten years will see continued growth in support for independence is far from wishful thinking.",,/r/europe/comments/ncda4s/a_divided_kingdom/gy78bv2/,vgrsfngrn,1621073827

It‚Äôs easy for the government to place all the burden on voters. But there are thing the government could do, like not choosing a date to vote when it‚Äôs most inconvenient for young people, or not asking people to register to vote a month in advance when we know that the vast majority of voters don‚Äôt pay attention to any kind of vote that early and when they do want to vote they find out they can‚Äôt.

by Unione Sindacale di Base 

[Photo of Asiatic Island](https://assets.contropiano.org/img/2021/05/asiatic-island.jpg)

In the afternoon of today the ship Asiatic Island will arrive in the port of Livorno. Thanks to the report of the Collective Autonomous Port Workers of Genoa and the association WeaponWhath we know that inside there are containers loaded with weapons and explosives bound for the Israeli port of Ashdod. Weapons and explosives that will be used to kill the Palestinian population already affected by a harsh attack just this night that caused hundreds of victims among the civilian population including many children.

We don't know yet if also in our port will be loaded containers of weapons and explosives but surely it would not be the first time that this happens. We are trying to gather information through the port workers who are members of the union. Just yesterday we received a report about the presence of dozens of military armored vehicles at the Italy Pier, ready to be loaded.

In addition to the issue of war there is also an objective problem of safety for workers and the population. In this sense, we have sent urgent reports to the Port Authority, the Port Authority and the ASL Occupational Medicine in order to carry out immediate and appropriate checks.

The Union of Basic Trade Unions will be in the square tomorrow in Livorno in solidarity with the Palestinian population and to demand an immediate stop to the bombing of Gaza and stop the ""expropriation"" of Palestinian homes that have been living under military occupation for years.

2433,"What's the point of it? To be nasty to people for fun? Government violence should be for a purpose, proportionate and necessary.

We're talking mostly about people presenting themselves to immigration officers and explaining why they believe they can enter the UK. Not someone sneaking across a border or providing a false passport. And we're talking about people who, in normal times, can say they're here for tourism and be allowed to enter. And we're talking about people for whom it's not very attractive to be an illegal immigrant in the UK. There is no reason at all not to grant immigration bail (which is what they say they'll do now).

The same should apply to people from many other countries, there's no need for this 'dripping sense of entitlement' bullshit, but most certainly including the EU. The risk is low that people will abscond and remain illegally. It's not like there's a public safety issue.

Brexit has already been about trashing Europeans' (and especially Brits') individual freedoms to move around our continent without government bureaucrats going on their power trips, and all for no useful public policy purpose whatsoever. There's no need to go even further in making the world a worse place.

No.

2435,"For Germany, the settlement ended the century-long struggle between the monarchical tendencies of the Holy Roman emperors and the federalistic aspirations of the empire‚Äôs German princes. 

The Peace of Westphalia recognized the full territorial sovereignty of the member states of the empire. They were empowered to contract treaties with one another and with foreign powers, provided that the emperor and the empire suffered no prejudice. By this and other changes the princes of the empire became absolute sovereigns in their own dominions. The Holy Roman emperor and the Diet were left with a mere shadow of their former power.  
  
Not only was the central authority of the empire replaced almost entirely by the sovereignty of about 300 princes, but the power of the empire was materially weakened in other ways. It lost about 100,000 square km of territory and obtained a frontier against France that was incapable of defense. 

Sweden and France as guarantors of the peace acquired the right of interference in the affairs of the empire, and Sweden also gained a voice in its councils (as a member of the Diet). For many years Germany thus became the principal theatre of European diplomacy and war, and the natural development of German national unity was delayed. 

But if the Treaty of Westphalia pronounced the dissolution of the old order in the empire, it facilitated the growth of new powers in its component parts, especially Austria, Bavaria, and Brandenburg. The treaty was recognized as a fundamental law of the German constitution and formed the basis of all subsequent treaties until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/ncqz8t/on_this_day_in_1648_the_peace_of_m√ºnster_is/gy70vzg/,capcaunul,1621066521

Boris Johnson claimed the UK paid 350 million pound a week to the EU, even put it as an ad for Brexit on buses, but this was a blatant lie. Also, lots of EU stuff can be interpreted in many ways, the country itself deciding on the exact wording of the law. So many laws that were said to be from the EU were made by the UK instead of coming from the EU in that wording. 

It was very much a case of what did the Romans do for us. 

For your second question, it's annoying that from now on I'm going to need an international passport instead of just my ID to travel to the UK, so that's almost 100 euro's I have to pay for that. It's annoying that some webshops became way more expensive. It's annoying to have long waits at customs. It's annoying for students wanting to go study in the UK.

I am generally conservative in my temperament to the extent that I'm change-averse. Something about me just *bristles* at the idea of more states in my union (e.g. Puerto Rico) or more independent states in the world (e.g. Scotland). I realize that this is just a totally irrational emotion that has no basis in what is right or fair. Every time I feel this way, I try to ask myself what is just and I like the idea of Scotland being independent because:

* If it were to happen, it would be the authentic will of that people and an exercise in democracy.
* An independent Scotland would be more left-wing than the rest of Britain and it would be nice to have that voice in the international sphere and EU.
* As someone who believes in democracy (in greater or lesser measure), it's nice to see fewer persons under a monarchy.
* As an American, it's nice to see someone sticking it to the English.

I don't have a horse in this race&amp;mdash;I'm not British, I don't have much if any Scottish heritage, there is a 0% chance I will live in Britain&amp;mdash;but I have some emotional investment in it for the reasons listed above as well as things like seeing history happening (particularly history that isn't atrocious) and it's something to tell the grandkids.

What does the EU as a whole lose by a big economy leaving? Well it has it's own [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_Brexit_on_the_European_Union), but here's a TLDR.

The EU is obviously funded by its member states. By having a one of them less, every single member state's shares increase. There are also other disadvantages.

Westminster set up the SNP to look foolish over it, and Alex Salmond fell for it.

2773,"&gt; A left-wing government is for a two state solution, this means disbanding a certain amount either half or slightly less than half in the sense of land exchanges 
(so that a Palestinian state won't lose *even more* ground + less evictions for people who *still* live in their homes).

FTFY

Which the Palestinians should accept. Not that it's a fair resolution (far from it) but they can't really hope for a better outcome.

&gt; Look at the opinion polls, the average Israeli is against settlement expansion. 

They should maybe stop voting for parties that support it then.

&gt; Most however would want a demilitarized Palestinian state, 
ie a NATO precense so as to avoid a group with the same ideology in it's charter as Hitler rising to power in a Palestinian state.

I'm sure the Palestinians would like a demilitarized Israel as well but that is an absurd expectation for either side to have.

&gt;ie a NATO precense so as to avoid a group with the same ideology in it's charter as Hitler rising to power in a Palestinian state.

NATO isn't a neutral party, it contains all of Israels closest Allies.

If that NATO presence is supposed to be inside the state of Palestine, it wouldn't be an independent state, just occupied by NATO instead of Israel.

A NATO presence inside Israel would be superfluous. A UN-administered buffer zone like [on Cyprus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Cyprus_districts_named.png) might be worth considering.

Frankly, those proposals about one-sided demilitarization and NATO presence just make me think that Israel need's to be forced (e.g. with an extensive regime of economic sanction) into accepting a resolution 
that could actually be called fair. (e.g. land swaps from a 1947 baseline)

Germany sells it's dolphin submarines to many non-Nato countries, as well. Egypt for example got very similar submarines.

I agree that settlement expansion to an extent should be tied to German aid, but I would also agree that path Konrad Adenauer took, as dictating that the security of Israel is part of German national interest, is something which at the time was a brave step for both nations, and I think both nations benefited immensly from the path of reconciliation , I think at first it could have been selfish intentions, the destruction of ISrael would mean holocaust survivors being refugees back to Europe and thus Germany having to deal with them, But like I said before I see conflicts which continue today in other parts of the world for actions which were much smaller in scale to the holocaust and much further in time and to a extent I'm lucky we both aren't in this position.",,/r/europe/comments/nc6pu9/merkel_condemns_antisemitism_in_protests_against/gy5vq75/,onlyreading123,1621037775

By *also* talking about the antisemites using the issue, instead of, say, just calling it ""overplayed card"", I'm doing exactly that.

Antisemitism isn't just this side thing that snuck up on everybody, like a few vandals joining a demonstration, either. Just take the version the of charter of Hamas from 1988:

&gt; ""Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it"" (The Martyr, Imam Hassan al-Banna, of blessed memory).

The one from 2017 is a lot better at eating chalk, but still fails to fucking convince:

&gt; Hamas is of the view that the Jewish problem, anti-Semitism and the persecution of the Jews are phenomena fundamentally linked to European history and not to the history of the Arabs and the Muslims or to their heritage.

Yeah, because Nazis were aliens who lived on Mars, but some day in 1933 invaded peaceful Germans, and then occupied them until 1945. Your story is very cool and you should tell us more about this extraterrestrial beings.

\&gt;&gt;They didn't care if the Germans living there voted&lt;&lt;

It doesn't matter how they voted in 1933, but what they did  in the next 12 years. For example, most member of reserve Order Police units weren't NSDAP members, and many of them proabably voted left parties before 1933. They were normal german workers, artisans, clerks or merchants - just a profile of the German society. Still, all of them actively participated in the genocide in occupied Soviet Union or Poland, without any reservations. 

Active and passive support of the German society was the only reason why Third Reich existed and why it committed genocides unprecedented in the history of humanity. You will never be able to whitewash this truth.

\&gt;&gt;You don't need to apologize ethnic cleansing&lt;&lt;

Apologize? Expelling genocide supporting population from Poland to their homeland was a fully justified and reasonable solution. I'm proud that Poles and other Allied nations were so humanitarian in 1945 and didn't even tried to do to Germans, what Germans did to them.

3276,"&gt; the thing is, Israel-Palestine get so much attention despite their small size. It's everywhere. China never got this much attention for what is happening in Xinjiang, despite being a lot larger and more powerful. 

Firstly, China gets much more attention for what is happening in Xinjiang. What is happening in Xinjiang also has massively less human suffering than what is happening Palestine. What you probably confuse is that China only recently started getting attention, while Israel gets attention since many decades.

Secondly, because Israel is actually relevant to several powerful countries. Thus they get more attention. It's never about the actual atrocities.

&gt; I don't get why people feel SO strongly about this issue in particular, and not for example, what's going on in Myanmar, Ethiopia or Yemen.

Basically exposure. Israel is important for the US because they are their unsinkable aircraft carrier in the middle east. Thus the US creates and gives attention to it to protect it from the Arab states. Since most media and media trends are heavily influenced by the US, you get much more exposure. More exposure means you also get much more opposition.

The two opposing theories:

**You say** police are sexist. Overall horrible people, whom regardless of skin colour treated every women as slugs. Their attitude led to the rise of grooming gangs. But white men are not rapists, only those from certain ethnic background. That is the reason why certain etnic groups formed grooming gangs others did not. Also, the fact that these gangs formed under Labour government is mere coincidence, there is no specific factor what caused these to pop up in within a few years in all regions of the country.

**I say** police and social services felt the same suffocating atmosphere where one have to tiptoe around minorities. Where just questioning one from a minority background leads to accusation of racism, a claim doesn't require any proof and costs you your job. This theory explains the whole situation with one single cause. It explains the timing of the rise, and the fall of these gangs explains the ethnic disparities, and doesn't require me to believe that the police officers and social workers man and women are all misoginistic scum.

2) There are variations within one country too. Why would ¬´¬†pain au chocolat¬†¬ª be imposed to the South-West of France while we‚Äôve called it ¬´¬†chocolatine¬†¬ª for centuries? Because some Parisians decided so?

3) Your so-called ¬´¬†French language identity¬†¬ª is your construct. French people also want to keep their variety of French. I call it chocolatine, chocolatine it is. Period. You‚Äôre no one to tell me how to call something. French is my mother-tongue and I don‚Äôt see why I should conform to rest of France by calling it ¬´¬†pain au chocolat¬†¬ª. Especially that Parisians today are the ones using slang terms and butchering the French language.

3384,"&gt; I‚Äôm not saying that the government should not discuss this topic. But, honestly, we‚Äôre in a pandemic, unemployment has risen over the past months, economic crisis is about to hit, we‚Äôre late at vaccinating people, and so on. I consider these topics more important as they are vital in a way and many lives are impacted by these issues.

Yes. I agree, this pandemic (and the governments response) has damaged France and French people. All I am saying is there are funds and manpower reserved for those. This judgement is coming from the Ministry of National Education. What do they have to do with the economic crisis? Or unemployment? The government isn't just Emmanuel Macron, Bruno Le Maire, or Borne. They also include the Ministry of the Armed Forces, National Education, Culture, etc. To say the government needs to focus on the pandemic and unemployment is something I can't understand. Each ministry has their own agenda. The perceived failure of Le Maire or Borne should not hinder other ministries from achieving their goals. 

This is (for me at least) is a big problem for France. Wouldn't it be better to correct things now rather than later? If the government just allocate funds to the COVID response and nothing else, won't this problem (and other problems faced by other ministries/sectors) just get bigger to the point that it would be very difficult to solve. And the what? People would get annoyed that the government is slow at their job.

&gt; Am I wrong? So, sorry if I offended you but I think the government should focus on the topics I mentioned above instead of ¬´ banning ¬ª √©criture inclusive.

Like I said, I get your anger. I am really angry too with the COVID response over there. But the government is filled with many actors. They are ministers with their own portfolios, agendas, and just their own things that they need to take care of. The government isn't just the Ministry of  Labour. It isn't just the Ministry of the Economy. Why should the Ministry of National Education not do their job because there colleagues are failing at their job.

&gt; And, honestly, I would leave this debate to professionals and experts in education, meaning, certainly not politicians who have no skills in pedagogy or anything related to education. They‚Äôre just professional politicians. I cannot stand them anymore.

And how would those professionals and expert act when all the power is held by the government? The job of a politician is to analyse the situation and create a plan of action to solve it. If it's not politicians, who will? Professionals will have their own opinion. Parents will have their own opinion. Students will have their own opinion. It's like saying businessmen should have control of the Ministry of the Economy. Everyone would have their own agendas that they will push. A politicians job is to create comprise or choose a side. Who would you want to replace them?

This is the Ministry of National Education carrying out the wishes of the AF. I would think they are professionals in what they are talking about.

4/ and when you talk about parisians butchering the language, I guess with terms like ""manager"", ""en conf-call"" or candidater ;) you're basically saying that I am right, and by extension on that matter that the acad√©mie is right

3408,"&gt;  Ok buddy, fucking deportation-genocides, now I've heard it all.     

The deportation of the Crimean Tatars (Crimean Tatar: Qƒ±rƒ±mtatar halqƒ±nƒ±√± s√ºrg√ºnligi) or the S√ºrg√ºnlik (""exile"") was the **ethnic cleansing and cultural genocide** of at least **191,044** Crimean Tatars in 18‚Äì20 May 1944 carried out by the Soviet government, ordered by Lavrentiy Beria, head of the Soviet state security and secret police, acting on behalf of Joseph Stalin     

&gt;  Nearly 8,000 Crimean Tatars died during the deportation, while tens of thousands perished subsequently due to the harsh exile conditions. The Crimean Tatar exile resulted in the abandonment of 80,000 households and 360,000 acres of land. An intense campaign of detatarization to erase remaining traces of Crimean Tatar existence followed     

&gt;  On 12 December 2015, the Ukrainian Parliament issued a resolution recognizing this event as genocide and established 18 May as the ""Day of Remembrance for the victims of the Crimean Tatar genocide."" The parliament of Latvia recognized the event as an act of genocide on 9 May 2019. The Parliament of Lithuania did the same on 6 June 2019. Canadian Parliament passed a motion on June 10, 2019, recognizing the Crimean Tatar deportation of 1944 (S√ºrg√ºnlik) as a genocide perpetrated by Soviet dictator Stalin, designating May 18 to be a day of remembrance.     

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_the_Crimean_Tatars      

&gt;  Did Stalin eat all your grain and order the clouds to not rain as well or?      

Rafal Lemkin, co-author of the legal definition of genocide, considered the Holodomor a classic example of Soviet genocide, the longest and most widespread attempt to Russify and exterminate the Ukrainian nation. The Ukrainian nation is too big for simple annihilation. Instead, religious, intellectual, and political elites are quite small and can be exterminated, which is why the Soviet government used the usual set of means: mass extermination, deportations, forced labor, exile, and starvation.     

In a book on genocide, Lemkin examines the problem of genocide beyond the later UN definition:     

&gt;  Generally speaking, genocide does not necessarily mean the rapid annihilation of a nation, except when it is carried out by mass executions of all members of the nation. Instead, it is more intended to denote a coordinated plan of various measures aimed at destroying the most important foundations for the life of national groups, with the aim of exterminating these groups. Among the goals of such a plan will be the destruction of political and social institutions, culture, language, national feeling, religion and economic environment of national groups, and the destruction of personal security, freedom, prosperity, dignity and even the lives of members of such groups. Genocide is directed against a national group as such, and measures are taken against individuals not because of their personal traits, but because of belonging to a national group.     

Lemkin sees four components in the Ukrainian genocide, namely:

&gt;  1. destruction of the Ukrainian intelligentsia - the brain or mind of the nation in order to paralyze the body of the nation. The main blows were inflicted in 1920, 1926, and 1932-1933;     

&gt;  2. liquidation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Autocephalous Church - the ""soul of Ukraine"". The same fate befell the Ukrainian Catholic Church after the occupation of Western Ukraine;     
&gt;  3. The Holodomor of the Ukrainian peasantry - the custodian of Ukrainian culture, language, tradition, etc. The Ukrainian peasantry was sacrificed to the creation of a homogeneous Soviet people. Contrary to attempts to justify the Holodomor by the severe consequences of collectivization and dekulakization, Stanislav Kosior in December 1933 called ""Ukrainian nationalism"" the main threat to Soviet power;     
&gt;  4. settlement of Ukraine by foreign ethnic elements for a radical change in the composition of the population, the dispersion of the nation throughout Eastern Europe.",Kharkiv (Ukraine),/r/europe/comments/nbhb54/prague_residents_throwing_molotov_cocktails_at/gy39v0w/,Regrup,1620994276

3440,"&gt; Ad hominem is simply attacking the person instead of addressing the point. It doesn't matter if it is true or false. 

That is called insult.

Yes one could argue that I insulted you. I did not use ad hominem though, because my argument was not dependent on me describing you.

&gt; No, ""the dumbest example"" isn't an insult. Calling someone dumb would be an insult. I pointed out that someone was choosing a bad example to make MY position look bad. 

It is. It's very rude behavior. For somebody who seem so care about the feelings of others, you do use very rude language. Strange.

&gt; Linguistics are irrelevant. Assuming male is sexist. Period. What is right and wrong grammatically is based on how language is used. It says nothing about sexism, racism, etc. 

No, no period. Just because you are linguistically illiterate and do not want to realize that everything relating to language is a subject for linguistics, doesn't mean that people have to accept that.

&gt; For example, we could imagine a language in which so-called ""white"" people have one set of pronouns, adjectives, nouns, etc., and we could imagine that so-called ""black"" people have another set. We could imagine that the norm is to assume white. People would rightfully call this racist, and the linguistics are IRRELEVANT. The linguistics don't say whether this is racist or not because it is irrelevant to linguistics. 

The speakers of the language, including those ""black"" people would laugh at those people for their lack of understanding. Similar how most women laugh about this whole generic ""he"" usage non-issue, especially if it is a language with grammatical gender.

This is an argument which is again rooted in your ignorance. 

Such a scenario is unlikely to develop because of many reasons, but if it were to develop and it had the same usage as it has today with grammatical gender, then no it would not be racist. And you would face the same resistance from the speakers, from both ""white"" and ""black"", as you see in case of sex, from both ""male"" and ""female"".

&gt; Maybe actually respond to that instead of vaguely attacking me and saying there is no problem.

It's hard to respond if your scenarios are mostly fantasies and do not correspond to the real world. You interpret language in a way it is not used.

In English, ""he"" can be used when referring to a male living being or when referring to a living being where the gender is irrelevant or sometimes he (as well as she) can be used even for inanimate objects. Most people do not assume any gender. When people use ""he"" in English most imagine the same thing as a Turkish speaker who said ""o"", a Finnish speaker who said ""h√§n"", a Hungarian speaker said ""≈ë"", a Mandarin speaker who said ""ta"", etc.

You seem to have a hard time grasping the concept of polysemy. Google it. I basically means words can have different meanings depending on context.

And that was only the English related problem you have. Apparently you also have a problem in realizing that most languages have grammatical agreement, where if the world happens to have a certain noun category then the referencing pronoun will duplicate it.

&amp;#x200B;

""The English term slave derives from the ethnonym Slav. In medieval wars many Slavs were captured and enslaved, which led to the word slav becoming synonym to ""enslaved person"". In addition, the English word Slav derives from the Middle English word sclave, which was borrowed from Medieval Latin sclavus or slavus, itself a borrowing and Byzantine Greek œÉŒ∫ŒªŒ¨Œ≤ŒøœÇ skl√°bos ""slave,"" **which was in turn apparently derived from a misunderstanding of the Slavic autonym (denoting a speaker of their own languages)**. The Byzantine term Sklavinoi was loaned into Arabic as Saqaliba (ÿµŸÇÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ©; sing. Saqlabi, ÿµŸÇŸÑÿ®Ÿä) by medieval Arab historiographers. However, the origin of this word is disputed. In 1995, for the first time, a version was expressed, according to which the Greek word Œ£Œ∫ŒªŒ¨Œ≤ŒπŒΩŒøŒπ does not come from the self-name of the Slavs, but from the Greek verb œÉŒ∫œÖŒªŒµœçŒø - ""to extract spoils of war"". **According to this version, the self-name of the Slavs and their Modern Greek name coincided phonetically purely by chance**.""",,/r/europe/comments/nc22xv/watermelon_concrete_trucks_in_ljubljana_slovenia/gy3bfda/,nfnf_,1620995187

3559,"&gt; Yes, it is. Just because it is ""normal"" doesn't mean it isn't sexist or discriminatory. Just imagine if people started assuming female. It would really bother you, as it should. Just because you can do that ""for both sexes"" (it is a spectrum, but alright) doesn't mean it isn't discriminatory. 

If that was a normal language feature then it would not bother anybody, at least not many. In German, I never encountered one male sibling who was bothered by the term ""Geschwister"", which means ""siblings"" and clearly is derived from the term ""Schwester"" that is ""sister"". Why? Because that is simply a language feature.

In many Arabic languages/dialects, it is normal to describe human groups with a female grammatical gender. Frequently cultures which speak such languages/dialects are quite patriarchal. How do you think they cope with that?

Those things are simply things inherent to languages because of the their evolution and history, others things like this are case, conjugation, etc.",EU Federalist,/r/europe/comments/nbw3g3/france_bans_genderneutral_language_in_schools/gy2s4zw/,yawaworthiness,1620979987

3645,"&gt;The initial Dutch defensive forces were quickly overcome, although they succeeded in destroying many bridges, thus delaying the Germans. However by the end of the first day of the war the Germans had captured Maastricht in the south

I live in Maastricht and just wanted to add some details to this. Maastricht is in the deep south of the Netherlands, right on the Belgium border, and very close to the important Belgian Eben-Emael fortress (which can still be visited, very cool). The Germans mainly wanted to keep Maastricht bridges intact to get to Eben-Emael with heavy equipment. Maastricht is also an ancient city with lots and lots of medieval buildings, even some Roman remains and anything in between.

A couple of things basically happened in those first hours of the war. One: the Germans did not succeed in keeping the bridges intact. All bridges were destroyed in time by the Dutch. Two: The Germans sustained higher casualties than expected/hoped. Nothing material in the big picture of things but they were somewhat surprised by the fierce response and lost more tanks, aircrafts etc in the battle of Maastricht than expected. Three: it was very clear that with an entire German tank division at the gates of the city and the Maastricht defenses only being two companies without any anti-tank and anti-air equipment, the outcome of the battle was set in stone.

To preserve the city, after blowing up the bridges, Maastricht capitulated to the Germans. As a resident of Maastricht I can only say I can totally understand that decision and am grateful for it.",,/r/europe/comments/nc0xpp/on_may_14_1940_four_days_after_the_germany/gy2s8lv/,Attygalle,1620980081

3670,"It‚Äôs my home, I‚Äôm just as European just as you. I was born here, my friends are here, my parents were born here, their friends are here. My family have been here for generations, just the same as yours. I really couldn‚Äôt consider myself anything but European. Being Jewish is just another part of my identity and a quirk of my families history the same way someone may be of Alsatian or Basque decent.

Despite the history that happened it makes me feel even more European in a way. My family died to live here and now I can continue to do so without fear. I‚Äôm not Israeli, and if you meet an Israeli you realise they‚Äôre another thing entirely. I have some commonalities with them that extend  beyond religion but I really am a totally different thing to them. 

Yes, there is some violence and hate. I‚Äôve obviously experienced racism myself but I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm not leaving Europe because my history is tied into the history of this continent and I really couldn‚Äôt imagine living anywhere else in the world. I am really proud to be Jewish and if someone asks where are my family from I tell them they are Jewish and they‚Äôre from x, y and a country. This is just how I view things; I‚Äôm European, then Jewish.  I am proud of both and I don‚Äôt see how either is incompatible with the other. Jewish people had a large presence in European history going back to the Roman Empire. My family look different, they speak strange languages and they follow weird customs. They‚Äôre also progressive and active in their civic society, they go for coffee for friends, they eat pizza, they travel, they‚Äôre invested in the community around them. Some Jews might just associate with other Jews and maybe because I am not conservative this is why my view is so open.

The politics in Israel is bad at the moment. Netanyahu is similar to Orban, and his politics are a Jewish version of the Christian fundamentalism we are seeing spring up across Europe derived from Ivan Illyin. Netanyahu has connections with Putin‚Äôs oligarchy and Natanyahu is a threat to democracy. Netanyahu also has personal connections with the far-right military culture and Jewish paramilitary/terrorist groups. His father was literally a terrorist. 

Many people in the Jewish community believe Natanyahu is heating up the conflict to take public and media scrutiny away from the current political crisis. Netanyahu has failed to form a government 5 times and he has no democratic mandate, he just refuses to step down and the is avoiding every possible mechanism that can remove him. He is running out of time so he is using this conflict to create a security issue that he can exploit politically. Netanyahu has always been a security focused populist and he has done this before. 

This turned into a rant but this is how I feel as a Jewish person in Europe. If you have any questions you would like to ask but never got the chance shoot away. I‚Äôm happy to answer anything.

I believe we have a duty to ALWAYS take a side in our local politics, (despite being aware that even the best side can't be perfect), and express it at least with our vote.

On the other hand, we have no need to take sides on wars that do not directly involve our country at this moment. What change can you make, anyway? WW2 already happened, what's the point of saying that the allies were the good ones and everything they did was justified, just because the axis did much worse? One side of the war being worse than the other doesn't imply the other one is necessary good.

[regarding crypto](https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog/signal.html)
&gt; Allegedly the controlling entity prints 250 million units of some artificially scarce trashcoin called MOB (coincidence?) of which the issuing organization controls 85% of the supply. This token then floats on a shady offshore cryptocurrency exchange hiding in the Cayman Islands or the Bahamas, where users can buy and exchange the token. The token is wash traded back and forth by insiders and the exchange itself to artificially pump up the price before it‚Äôs dumped on users in the UK to buy to allegedly use as ‚Äúpayments‚Äù. All of this while insiders are free to silently use information asymmetry to cash out on the influx of pumped hype-driven buys before the token crashes in value. Did I mention that the exchange that floats the token is the primary investor in the company itself, does anyone else see a major conflict of interest here?

I recommend you to [look at this chart](https://www.messenger-matrix.de/messenger-matrix-en.html) if you really think Signal is that great, there are clearly very easy to set up options which are far superior to Signal like Element (default setting with provided server) and Threema and partly even Conversations/Siskin is on par with Signal, so when you recommend better option to WhatsApp you should go for Element or Threema and not shady non-transparent project of one guy who decides he doesnt like 3rd party clients, rolls own crypto, publishes server source code after year and pressure from media etc, Signal used to be decent option years ago before Element matured and was never really that great next to Threema, which has only con - clear financing by one time fee",,/r/europe/comments/nbju6p/share_of_survey_respondents_saying_they_regularly/gy2kerr/,RGBchocolate,1620973255

3812,"Edward Jenner (17 May 1749 ‚Äì 26 January 1823) was an English physician and scientist who pioneered the concept of vaccines including creating the smallpox vaccine, the world's first vaccine. The terms *vaccine* and *vaccination* are derived from *Variolae vaccinae* (smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Jenner to denote cowpox.

Smallpox was widespread in the 18th century, and occasional outbreaks of special intensity resulted in a very high death rate. In Jenner's time, smallpox killed around 10% of the population, with the number as high as 20% in towns and cities where infection spread more easily. The disease, a leading cause of death at the time, respected no social class, and disfigurement was not uncommon in patients who recovered. The only means of combating smallpox was a primitive form of vaccination called variolation‚Äîintentionally infecting a healthy person with the ‚Äúmatter‚Äù taken from a patient sick with a mild attack of the disease.

The practice, which originated in China and India, was based on two distinct concepts: first, that one attack of smallpox effectively protected against any subsequent attack and, second, that a person deliberately infected with a mild case of the disease would safely acquire such protection. It was, in present-day terminology, an ‚Äúelective‚Äù infection‚Äîi.e., one given to a person in good health. Unfortunately, the transmitted disease did not always remain mild, and mortality sometimes occurred. Furthermore, the inoculated person could disseminate the disease to others and thus act as a focus of infection.

Jenner had been impressed by the fact that a person who had suffered an attack of cowpox‚Äîa relatively harmless disease that could be contracted from cattle‚Äîcould not take the smallpox‚Äîi.e., could not become infected whether by accidental or intentional exposure to smallpox. Pondering this phenomenon, Jenner concluded that cowpox not only protected against smallpox but could be transmitted from one person to another as a deliberate mechanism of protection.

The story of the great breakthrough is well known. In May 1796 Jenner found a young dairymaid, Sarah Nelmes, who had fresh cowpox lesions on her hand. On May 14, using matter from Sarah‚Äôs lesions, he inoculated an eight-year-old boy, James Phipps, who had never had smallpox. Phipps became slightly ill over the course of the next 9 days but was well on the 10th. On July 1 Jenner inoculated the boy again, this time with smallpox matter. No disease developed; protection was complete. In 1798 Jenner, having added further cases, published privately a slender book entitled *An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae*.

The reaction to the publication was not immediately favourable. Jenner went to London seeking volunteers for vaccination but, in a stay of three months, was not successful. In London vaccination became popularized through the activities of others, particularly the surgeon Henry Cline, to whom Jenner had given some of the inoculant, and the doctors George Pearson and William Woodville. Difficulties arose, some of them quite unpleasant; Pearson tried to take credit away from Jenner, and Woodville, a physician in a smallpox hospital, contaminated the cowpox matter with smallpox virus. Vaccination rapidly proved its value, however, and Jenner became intensely active promoting it. The procedure spread rapidly to America and the rest of Europe and soon was carried around the world.

Complications were many. Vaccination seemed simple, but the vast number of persons who practiced it did not necessarily follow the procedure that Jenner had recommended, and deliberate or unconscious innovations often impaired the effectiveness. Pure cowpox vaccine was not always easy to obtain, nor was it easy to preserve or transmit. Furthermore, the biological factors that produce immunity were not yet understood; much information had to be gathered and a great many mistakes made before a fully effective procedure could be developed, even on an empirical basis.

Despite errors and occasional chicanery, the death rate from smallpox plunged. Jenner received worldwide recognition and many honours, but he made no attempt to enrich himself through his discovery and actually devoted so much time to the cause of vaccination that his private practice and personal affairs suffered severely. Parliament voted him a sum of ¬£10,000 in 1802 and a further sum of ¬£20,000 in 1806. Jenner not only received honours but also aroused opposition and found himself subjected to attacks and calumnies, despite which he continued his activities on behalf of vaccination. His wife, ill with tuberculosis, died in 1815, and Jenner retired from public life.

Neither fanatic nor lax, Jenner was a Christian who in his personal correspondence showed himself quite spiritual; he treasured the Bible. Some days before his death, he stated to a friend: ""I am not surprised that men are not grateful to me; but I wonder that they are not grateful to God for the good which He has made me the instrument of conveying to my fellow creatures"".

In the West, Jenner is often called ""the father of immunology"", and his work is said to have ""saved more lives than the work of any other human"".

3896,"On May 10th the Germans invaded the neutral Netherlands. The Germans started with a surprise attack on Dutch Airfields. The Germans had an overall advantage over the Dutch who had very little armor and whose air force was no match for the German Luftwaffe. The Germans followed up their air attacks with paratrooper landing on the main Dutch air fields. The attacks had mixed success.

The initial Dutch defensive forces were quickly overcome, although they succeeded in destroying many bridges, thus delaying the Germans. However by the end of the first day of the war the Germans had captured Maastricht in the south. Despite the arrival of the first French the Dutch were forced to continue to withdraw. By the end of the second day the Dutch had withdrawn to their last line of defense.

On May 13th the Queen and the government the Netherlands departed for England. Three Dutch Merchant vessels escorted by the Royal Navy transported the Dutch bullion and key documents to England. The army continued to resist even though there could be no doubt what the final outcome would be. On May 14th the commander of the Luftwaffe Hermann Goring ordered a massive bombing attack on Rotterdam. The attack destroyed much of the center of the city destroying 24,000 homes. The Germans then gave the Dutch an ultimatum, surrender or the rest of your cities will be destroyed. The Dutch surrendered at the end of the day.

&gt;Polish and Romanians top nationalities applying for EU settlement scheme
&gt;
&gt;People from Poland and Romania have made more applications to the EU settlement scheme than any other nationality, figures show.
&gt;
&gt;EU citizens and their families are asked to apply to the Home Office scheme by June in order to carry on living and working in the UK now the Brexit transition period and freedom of movement has ended.
&gt;
&gt;A total of 5,060,600 applications have been received since the scheme opened in March 2019, according to provisional Home Office figures to the end of January.
&gt;
&gt;More than 2.4 million of those (2,497,600) have been granted settled status, allowing them permanent leave to remain.
&gt;
&gt;A further two million (2,039,800) have been granted pre-settled status, meaning they need to reapply after living in the country for five years to gain permanent residence.
&gt;
&gt;Meanwhile, 38,900 applications have been refused, 51,400 were withdrawn or void and 50,600 were deemed invalid ‚Äì where the Home Office decides someone is not eligible to apply or has failed to provide sufficient proof of residence.
&gt;
&gt;As of December 31 2020, 4,916,280 applications had been received, with 90% received in England, 5% in Scotland, 2% in Wales and 2% in Northern Ireland, according to Home Office figures published on Thursday.
&gt;
&gt;In total, there were 4,569,010 applications received from EU nationals, 45,550 received from other EEA and Swiss nationals and 301,660 received from non-EEA nationals.
&gt;
&gt;The top nationalities to apply were Polish (911,240), Romanian (836,980), Italian (472,300), Portuguese (354,190) and Spanish (301,790).
&gt;
&gt;The Home Office said the top five nationalities combined represented around 60% of applications received.
&gt;
&gt;Polish and Romanian nationals were consistently among the highest application numbers within England, Scotland and Wales, while in Northern Ireland it was Polish and Lithuanian nationals who accounted for the largest number of applications.
&gt;
&gt;Minister for future borders and immigration Kevin Foster said: ‚ÄúEuropean citizens are our friends, family and neighbours which is why I‚Äôm really proud we‚Äôve already surpassed five million applications to the hugely successful EU Settlement Scheme.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúI would urge all those eligible to apply now to secure their status in UK law.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúThe scheme is designed to be simple and straightforward but support is available seven days a week by telephone and by email, and we‚Äôve funded 72 organisations across the UK to provide assistance to those who need help applying.‚Äù",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/nbwr9w/five_million_eu_citizens_apply_for_uk_settled/gy22thr/,duisThias,1620961373
3981,"&gt; But they should not be role models to emulate.

Who is emulating them? Is Israel indiscriminately firing unguided rockets at Gaza?  No. There's a stark contrast between how both sides fight when it comes to regard for civilian casualties.

&gt; Have you considered possibility that if Israel treated them better, more would be open to it?

Yes. And the Israelis consider those things to as they are also divided on how to approach peace with a range of opinions that exist.

&gt; I am not using loaded terms. Israel is definitely mistreating Palestinians. That doesn't mean that everything Israel does to Palestinians is mistreatment.

Would you agree that the way Hamas operates mistreats Israelis?  If so, then you see why this has been such an intractable problem for so long.

&gt; It's also easy for us comfortable Westerners to say ""Oh come not, why don't Palestinians just stop shooting rockets at Israel?"" when we are not the ones that have to live under occupation in poverty.

Yes, it should be easy for *everyone* to say that because it's the tactic of terrorists.  

Much of the reason for the poverty is because it is Hamas that is in charge of Gaza (hence the blockade) and corruption within Hamas diverts what aid is given to personal interests and war-making.

&gt; You admit you don't know how fair they were. Do you think it's possible Palestinians walked away because they weren't fair?

I'm sure they didn't because they instead chose war (2nd Intifada).  But at some point, you have to ask if a deal that isn't as fair as you'd like is better than constant war.  If peace were desirable to the Palestinians, they'd continue negotiating.  And the window for something close to fair may be closing more quickly since the Abraham Accords and Israel normalizing relations with many of its other Arab neighbors.  It used to be that the issue of the Palestinians always kept the Arab world united against Israel, but that ship is starting to sail.

&gt; Did they vote to buy rockets to shoot at Israel or not?

Hamas is the government in Gaza. If regular Gazans don't like what Hamas does, they would do something about it.

&gt; Actions of terrorists are insufficient excuse for poor treatment of millions of civilians, which includes clear violations of international law. Both sides need to do better but since Israel has power, most of work is up to them.

&gt;cafeteria (n.)
&gt;
&gt;1839, ""cafe,"" American English, from Mexican Spanish *cafeteria* ""coffee store,"" from *caf√©* ""coffee"" (see coffee) + Spanish *-ter√≠a* ""place where something is done"" (usually business). Sense shifted by 1890s to ""self-service dining establishment."" The ending came to be understood popularly as meaning ""help-yourself"" and was extended to new formation with that sense from c. 1923.
&gt;
&gt;Examples of the thing itself date to 1885, but they seem to have become established first in Chicago in the early 1890s by social and philanthropic organizations (such as the YWCA) to offer working girls affordable, fast, light meals in a congenial atmosphere. Their popularity waned after c. 1926, eclipsed by coffee shops, lunch counters, and sandwich shops. Industrial plants began to add them in 1915; schools and colleges followed.

I mean, it's not that strange for words, including loanwords, to shift in meaning over time.  Italian will do the same thing.

""Silly"" is one of my favorite examples for English:

&gt;The word's considerable sense development moved from ""happy"" to ""blessed"" to ""pious,"" to ""innocent"" (c. 1200), to ""harmless,"" to ""pitiable"" (late 13c.), ""weak"" (c. 1300), to ""feeble in mind, lacking in reason, foolish"" (1570s).

They should do that if they're going to use this map.

4224,"No siis valloitusteoria on v√§h√§n vanhentunut, mutta kyll√§h√§n sill√§kin on viel√§ kannattajiaan. En nyt muista mit√§ Tarkiaisen kirjassa tarkalleen sanotaan, mutta kommenteistasi p√§√§tellen kyse taitaa olla siit√§ teoriasta ett√§ Kalanti/Varsinaissuomi hiljalleen ajautui osaksi Ruotsin valtakunnan piiri√§ liittolais-tai alistuneisuussuhteen kautta. Toki asiasta ei ole yksimielisyytt√§ ja ei varmaan ikin√§ tule olemaan. Toisaalta en kommenteissani kertaakaan viitannut valloitusteoriaan, vaan siihen ett√§ Suomea pidettiin valloitettuna maana. T√§m√§ v√§itteeni perustuu Aira Kemil√§isen ja Kari Tarkiaisen kirjallisuuteen. Helsingin pormestarikin joskus 1600/1700 luvuilla totesi kaupungin vaakunan olevan muistutus ""esi-isiemme voitokkaista aseista"". Olihan n√§√§ keskiaikaiset ristiretkilegendat pitk√§√§n ihan validia historiaa. En siis tarkoittanut, ett√§ Suomi olisi ollut mik√§√§n siirtomaa/ei-integroitu voittomaa, mutta Suomea ja suomalaisia pidettiin vallattuna kansana ja maana. T√§m√§ tuodaan esille my√∂s It√§maa-sarjassa, jos muistan oikein. (Kenties siin√§ Villstrandin tai Meinanderin kirjassa?) 

En my√∂sk√§√§n puhunut kommenteissani kansalaisuudesta ollenkaan. Kansalaisuushan on suht. tuore k√§site, Ruotsin valtakunnan asukkaista alettiin puhumaan kansalaisina joskus valistusajalla. T√§t√§ ennen kaikki olivat monarkin alamaisia. Suomalaisilla ja ruotsalaisilla oli l√§ht√∂kohtaisesti ja periaatteessa samat oikeudet, t√§m√§ on totta. Mutta pit√§√§ ottaa huomioon se, ett√§ suomalaiset eiv√§t voineet toteuttaa kaikkia oikeuksiaan kansalaisina/alamaisina kielens√§ takia. 

Ja tuosta alentuvasta suhtautumisesta suomalaisiin on lukemattomia esimerkkej√§. Toki t√§m√§kin vaihteli kuudensadan vuoden aikana riippuen ajasta, henkil√∂st√§ ja paikasta, mutta mm. useat Turun piispat ja kenraalikuvern√∂√∂rit halveksuivat suomalaisia. Esimerkiksi Pietari Brahe halveksi Sis√§-Suomen asukkaita ja Nils Bilke kuvaili Suomea barbarian kulmakunnaksi. Piispa Isak Rothovius kuvaili suomalaisia barbaareiksi ja yritti ruotsalaistaa koulutusj√§rjestelm√§√§. Professori Israel Nesselius ehdotti suomen kielen tuhoamista koko valtakkunnan alueelta, paitsi Lapista. T√§llaisia esimerkkej√§ on monia.


Tdlr: Jos ymm√§rsin pointtisi oikein, niin ollaan aikalailla samalla sivulla t√§n asian kanssa. Ehk√§ ilmaisin itse√§ni v√§h√§n huonosti noissa aiemmissa kommenteissa.

Bombing it may have helped liberate Auschwitz sooner though.  

&gt;The US Air Force Historical Division wrote a report in response to the international concern about the bombing that remained classified until December 1978.[39] It said that there were 110 factories and 50,000 workers in the city supporting the German war effort at the time of the raid.[40] According to the report, there were aircraft components factories; a poison gas factory (Chemische Fabrik Goye and Company); an anti-aircraft and field gun factory (Lehman); an optical goods factory (Zeiss Ikon AG); and factories producing electrical and X-ray apparatus (Koch &amp; Sterzel [de] AG); gears and differentials (Saxoniswerke); and electric gauges (Gebr√ºder Bassler). It also said there were barracks, hutted camps, and a munitions storage depot.[41]

&gt;The USAF report also states that two of Dresden's traffic routes were of military importance: north-south from Germany to Czechoslovakia, and east‚Äìwest along the central European uplands.[42] The city was at the junction of the Berlin-Prague-Vienna railway line, as well as the Munich-Breslau, and Hamburg-Leipzig lines.[42] Colonel Harold E. Cook, a US POW held in the Friedrichstadt marshaling yard the night before the attacks, later said that ""I saw with my own eyes that Dresden was an armed camp: thousands of German troops, tanks and artillery and miles of freight cars loaded with supplies supporting and transporting German logistics towards the east to meet the Russians"".[43]",,/r/europe/comments/nbhm34/13_may_1901_witold_pilecki_was_born_in_1940_he/gy0qmu9/,6aaf72db-ac27-4a59-8,1620937120

4366,"Here are some reasons for my comment:

-During swedish rule, finnish language and culture were frowned upon and seen as inferior and primitive when compared to swedish or german. Finns were also seen as uncivilised. 

-Finland was seen as an conquered land, especially in the stormaktstiden. Half of the taxes collected from Finland went to developing sweden. 

-forest finns were forced to speak swedish on the threat of being declared outlaws by queen Christina. Their houses and crops were burned down. Many of them were forcefully relocated to swedish Delaware. Reading finnish literature could land you in jail even in the 1700s.

-Finns often couldn't communicate with the crowns officials. And when finnish people requested more finnish-speaking officials their calls were ignored. Finnish couldn't be used in the riksdag, courts or other bureaus. 

-Swedish colonists were almost always favoured when there was a problem with fishing rights or farming rights, for example. And there is evidence of finnish settlement disappearing when swedish colonists showed up (for example in Kemi√∂nsaari/Kimito√∂n), which would hint towards some sort of conflict between the groups.


But swedish rule really wasn't all bad. It was better than baltic german or russian rule, but it annoys me how many swedes view our mutual history with rose-tinted glasses.",,/r/europe/comments/nbcd2z/sweden_at_the_greatest_extent_1660/gy08w9w/,NipNap122,1620929850

Ever since the CFE was introduced its seen a marked fall in the educational attainment of state pupils, and the Scottish government has postponed the OECD review of it multiple times in the last year. This is despite the SNP having said in their keynote speech back in 2015 that they want the electorate to judge them on their educational record.

&gt;Now you had to type a paragraph for 6 words, let's stay with Robert Burns, here's a short sample of his famous work Tam O 'Shanter 
&gt;O Tam! had‚Äôst thou but been sae wise, As taen thy ain wife Kate‚Äôs advice! She tauld thee weel thou was a skellum, A blethering, blustering, drunken blellum; That frae November till October, Ae market-day thou was na sober; That ilka melder wi‚Äô the Miller, Thou sat as lang as thou had siller ‚Ä¶
&gt;
&gt;How do you get on with this? Admittedly it is easier to understand in written form as you correctly said, you can see links with other words, but when spoken it can be very different. 

Can't understand a word scots say. But reading it aloud with a *light* scottish accent works for understanding.

But alright let's see here, this is fun...
Oh Tam, if only you'd been so wise to have taken your own wife Kate's advice. She certainly told you you were a [generic drunkard insults]; from november to october[all year], even market day(?) you weren't sober. With the miller(ilka melder?? I guess insult) you sat and drank as long as you had cash.

&gt;It's difficult enough being understood with a Scottish accent, people that speak Scots are quite often misunderstood by other Scottish people. However there are quite a few books now being written in Scots which is helping things. 

Yeah holy hell that's hopeless. We've got a few of those dialect-languages here in sweden as well. I've some experience with something called ""√Ñlvdalska""(heh, literally elvendaleish, sounds like fantasy). It's the weirdest shit.

4763,"&gt;Scots is pretty much a dialect. If you understand English, you can probably understand someone speaking Scots

Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian are all mutually intelligible to varying extents but that doesn't mean it's all the one language. Similarly, Jamaican patois is mutually intelligible with English to a certain extent but that doesn't mean it's English. Unless you're saying that you know what ""Weh yuh ah seh"", ""Lickkle more"" or ""Wah Gwaan"" mean without looking it up.

""Bifuo di uman tel im pikni fi tap wala op im hanlina mi fuud, im kom sok im tiit aita mi.""

If you said the above out loud, you'd probably be able to pick out a few of the equivalent English words, but I sincerely doubt you'd be able to tell me even the gist of what's being said.

I've had requests for the spreadsheet, so here is the original as of 17th November: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HUFdsIJEXFPcawCd7KC1atBzuzf59bGkeJTJqnURTTk/edit?usp=sharing

I won't be keeping these versions up to date but you can see how the data is entered and calculated. 

**Version Notes**

The ecdc stopped updating data on a daily basis as of 14th December. I figured weekly data wasn't particularly useful and while the worldometer data is not as accurate as an official agency, at least it is daily so people can make informed decisions about it. 

Just so you can see the extend of the variances, here is the data for the 12th, 13th and 14th of December between worldometer and ecdc: https://imgur.com/Y71Nx7o

Some of this will be due to delays in data reporting and methodologies, others will be the source. In order to do a more detailed comparison, you need to look at the data sources on the ecdc and worldometer sites.

The good news is that worldometer data allows me to look wider than just the UK and EU and also has up-to-date testing data, which allows for the positivity data to be more useful and match the case data in terms of time frame. 

I've added vaccination data as of 23 March 2021. This data is sourced separately and is also not always fully up to date - as such, there's a column which includes the data date. Note that I will be reporting as per the data collected by ""Our World in Data"". 

**Schedule**

I will post this chart daily (where possible) during the week, Monday to Friday but I will not update it at weekends because around half of the countries do not update their numbers over the weekend and also it's on a computer I would not otherwise be logging onto, unless there's something particularly notable which requires a weekend update.

**Explaining some numbers**

*What is the 7 day case rate?* 

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it.

The 7 day case rate number in the graph is the number of people in that stadium who would have a coronavirus infection a week later. For example, in the UK on the 8th November the number was 239.7. That means 240 out of 100,000 people in the stadium would have an infection the following week.

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the daily movement*

The daily movement numbers are just how the 7 day case rate is moving up and down each day. The 7 day trend is the most interesting number - it's the sum of all the ups and downs. If you think of the infection as a car then the 7 day case rate is the speed of the coronavirus infection and the 7 day trend is the acceleration (or deceleration) of the infection. If the 7 day trend is red it's accelerating, if it's neither red nor green it's holding steady and if it's green it means it's slowing down (note - a green 7 day rate doesn't mean the infection is shrinking, just that it's slowing down).

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*How can I tell if the infection is shrinking*

You can't infer that from this data, this data only looks and new cases and the rate of change in new cases. The other side of the equation is how many people are recovering from coronavirus in each country. If you think of it like a bath - this is how much water is flowing through the taps. You cannot tell how much water is going down the plughole so you can't tell how much water is in the bath (i.e. the infection level).

*What is testing rate per 100,000?*

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it.

The testing rate is how many of those 100,000 people will have received a coronavirus test in a 7 day period. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the positive test rate*

This is the % of tests taken which are coming back positive. The WHO says countries should aim for this to be 3% or lower and that testing not keeping up with infections if the rate is above 10%. If you don't have enough tests, you restrict access to them to people who are more likely to be infected either by their symptoms or their risk of exposure, and that inflates your numbers.

This number is a ratio of tests completed, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 3% adjusted case rate*

Used to be the 10% rate but has been rebased around 3%. There is also a lower limit at 1% where the impact will be reduced by a factor of 5. 

Countries with a higher positivity rate are not testing enough of their population, so this multiplies their most recent day's case rate by a factor of their positivity rate divided by 3% - for example on 6th April Greece's positivity rate was 6% so their daily case rate was multiplied by 6%/3% = 2

**This is not** an estimate of the true scale of the pandemic within the country** but is a proxy to rank countries by accounting for countries who are showing a lower positive case rate because they're not doing enough testing.

This number accounts for population size AND level of testing within a country, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 7 Day Vaccines per 100,000?*

Imagine a football stadium with 100,000 people in it. This is the number of people in the stadium who would have received a vaccine dose of that stadium in a 7 day period. 

This number accounts for population size, so you can compare country-by country

*What is the 1st Dose %*

This is the % of a population who have received their first vaccine dose. It covers total population which includes children so will be lower than the number some sources cite (% of adult population)

*What is the 2nd Dose %*

This is the % of a population who have received all of their vaccine doses to be considered vaccinated (includes single dose vaccines like J&amp;J)

**What are the marks out of 10**

A formula gives every country a score between 1 and 11 for how bad their 10% adjusted case rate is and multiples it by the 1st dose %. The higher the better. 

For the graph on 22nd March, Estonia, at the top of the chart, gets a score of 1; Iceland, at the bottom of the chart, gets a score of 11. Everybody else gets a score somewhere in between. It then multiplies this by the percentage of the population who have received their first vaccine. Since no country has a vaccine rate greater than 90% it is effectively a score between 1 and 10.

What does it mean? It's a score as to how well the country is managing the pandemic - when the score gets close to 10 this means they have very low infection rates and very high vaccination rates. 

This number accounts for population size AND level of testing AND vaccine rates within a country, so you can compare country-by country

**Why sort by the 10% Adjusted Rate?**

Look at Poland on 9th November as an example - their actual 7 day rate was not actually much higher than the UK's (200 vs 160) and is lower than Denmark's (221), but their positive test rate is 49% - basically 1 out of 2 tests came back positive compared to 5% for UK and 2% for Denmark. Poland only test a fraction of their population compared to the UK or Denmark (706  vs 3198 / 8658 per 100,000) so their actual rate of infection is going to be much higher - their 7 day rate is just kept artificially low by the amount of tests they're (not) doing.

The 10% Adjusted Rate accounts for this. 

This method is **not perfect** as countries account for positivity differently. For instance, some countries (e.g. UK, Italy) include lateral flow tests in overall testing rates and positivity whereas other countries (e.g. Germany) only include PCR so their rates will appear higher and testing rates will appear lower. In addition, countries may alter the way they account for things. While it's important to use this metric to help smooth out countries not doing enough testing, remember that it's not perfect and doesn't tell the full story. 

There is no one unbiased source and you should seek to get your information from a range of sources and assess the underlying bias in the information you're reading and the possible agenda that source may have.

**Why is X country not on the list? / Why is this EU-centric / There are non-EU countries above the total**

I originally did refer to this as EU rather than Europe and I had a lot of comments from people about their country being in the data but them not being in the EU. So I removed any reference to the EU. Since then I've had increasing numbers of comments about why this is EU-centric. To be clear - countries above the grey line aren‚Äôt just EU, the reason they‚Äôre above the line is because they were the countries tracked by the ecdc which was the original source of the data.

Since December I‚Äôve had to switch to using worldometer as the ecdc only provide weekly data. As such I added a small basket of additional countries but I added these below the line, because I wanted the data to be comparable for people looking pre- and post- ecdc data. The countries in the basket were those most commonly requested. The only limitation I have is that I need to be able to fit the screenshot on one page. The total number of lines available is 41, so I don‚Äôt have enough lines for all 48-51 European countries (depending on where you draw the line on Europe and which states you recognize). 

Regardless of how I cut this, it seems it‚Äôs going to annoy somebody. But if you have a country that you feel should be represented that isn't and there's enough demand for it, I'm happy to see what I can accommodate.","British, spiritual EU citizen in exile due to Brexit üôÅ",/r/europe/comments/nbboo4/7_day_case_rate_positivity_rate_and_vaccination/gxyf8hy/,sonicandfffan,1620893979

4898,"**Commentary**

Firstly, Brazil's data is iffy this week, with positivity rate being 107% - that means they're reporting less tests taken than they are new cases. I can't do anything about this, but hopefully it will correct itself over the next week or so.

Secondly, I wanted to highlight a concerning trend in the UK's vaccination rate. The rate previously has been around 5,200 per 100,000, this week it's dropped by about 10% to 4,700 per 100,000. There hasn't been a reduction in supply which ties in with the concerning story we saw yesterday that the UK is stockpiling rather than using them. Our vaccination rate is actually below the European average and there are 13 countries who are vaccinating at a faster rate than the UK on the chart. While UK performance on vaccines has been very good previously, right now it's due a more critical look and questions need to be asked about what's going on.  

Also the increases in the UK data are actual increases and not just noise, it's something to keep an eye on in the next few weeks.","British, spiritual EU citizen in exile due to Brexit üôÅ",/r/europe/comments/nbboo4/7_day_case_rate_positivity_rate_and_vaccination/gxyf929/,sonicandfffan,1620893994

5067,"May 13 marks the anniversary of the first of six apparitions of the Virgin Mary to three shepherd children of F√°tima, Portugal.   
  
Lucia dos Santos (aged 9) and her cousins Francisco and Jacinta Marto (aged 8 and 6, respectively) were tending sheep in central Portugal in 1917 when they had a vision of a woman surrounded by light who identified herself as the Lady of the Rosary. She exhorted them to pray the rosary for world peace and, over the course of her six apparitions, gave the children three ""secrets.""   
  
She promised a miracle in October, and on the 13th of that month a crowd of perhaps 70,000 people witnessed a ""miraculous solar phenomenon,"" in which the Sun appeared to fall toward Earth. After initially questioning the authenticity of the children's visions, the Vatican accepted them as appearances of the Virgin Mary (Our Lady of the Holy Rosary of F√°tima), and F√°tima became the location of one of the greatest Marian shrines in the world, visited by thousands of pilgrims each year.  
  
Although Lucia dos Santos would later become a Carmelite nun and live to the age of 97, Francisco and Jacinta Marto died as children as a result of the influenza pandemic of 1918‚Äì19. 

The pious siblings were beatified in 2000 by Pope John Paul II, making them the youngest non-martyred children to be beatified in the history of the Roman Catholic Church. They were canonized as saints by Pope Francis in 2017 to coincide with the 100th anniversary of their visions.",,/r/europe/comments/nb8v5g/this_day_in_1917_three_portuguese_children_l√∫cia/gxy14hw/,Vucea,1620882025

In short; stop making fumb vompsrissons like ""but they did x later to us so us doing y to another country was fine"" no it wasnt. It was basically nazi collaboration what happened to the czechs. Their blood is also on polish hands. Obviously to a minor degree then germany or hungary but polands actions  helped to make those barbaric acts possible.

Also, the biggest ethnical cleansing in europe was actually the sysrematic purge of germans from eastern europe at the end and shortly after WW2. Simply by size it was the biggest population displacemeant in european history.
If the ethnical cleansing of poles would have been finished as the nazis planned it, then yes you would ve right until their plans with the soviets would be finished.
Ethnical cleansing is more then just killing other ethnicities on mass

5204,"&gt; The ancient rockets of Hamas have near zero chance to be any real threat to Israel, because Israel employs missile shields everywhere.

At least two Israeli children (one of them Israeli Arab) got killed and many other people (Jews and Arabs alike) got killed or injured by rockets shot indiscriminately from Gaza just in the last two days.

The Iron Dome is only 85-90% effective and over a thousand rockets were fired. Many of them got through and some of them hit schools, too. Luckily children were sent home before but I highly doubt that Hamas considered that.

&gt; Meanwhile the Israeli bombings always hit civilians because the Palestinians do not have a missile shield or any advanced military technology.

Israel sends out warnings in advance before bombing residential buildings, then shoots knocking missiles (that don't explode) as a warning, and only then destroys those buildings.

Israeli bombings don't ""always hit civilians"" at all, and their engagements have specific military targets. Some of those are indeed close to civilians, and may or may not have been deliberately placed there by terrorists (I don't know that).

That being said, the Israeli forces seem to accept some degree of collateral damage which I disagree with.

&gt; One side is throwing paper planes and the other side is redecorating Gaza with bodies.

Many of those paper planes fall before reaching Israel, killing their own people. Both sides are decorating Gaza with bodies but only one side is bombing indiscriminately, including their own people (whether in Gaza by failed rockets, or in Israel by hitting Israeli Arabs).",Western Eurasia,/r/europe/comments/nawj1b/today_at_the_headquarter_of_the_cdu_party_in/gxx5c8p/,AllinWaker,1620864799

I guess you mean stuff like this? Oleg Gazmanov performing ""made in the USSR"" in Kharkiv, Ukraine in 2012 with tons of USSR symbolism and insane crowds?


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9834D7n6fE


News flash, that was just nostalgia. Towards the USSR, the old way of life, just like say Ostalgia in East Germany. It does not mean people want a war. And want to be forcibly taken by Russia, as it's towards the USSR NOT Putin's Modern Russia. Which made Ukrainian's stop listening to Gazmanov and the authorities to ban him after Russian green man attacked...


I would think this kind of propaganda would stop after losing Odessa. We all know Odessa was in the ""Novorossiya"" agenda, and being mostly Russian/Russian speaking and very prominent in Russian culture (plus strategic by location) the port city did NOT go with the propaganda. Despite a questionable fire killing many and years of somewhat discrimination in Ukraine (all ads, billboards etc in Russian, but all official offices in Ukrainian was weird for any tourist) the city did NOT go with Russia's war/occupation.


Soooo... I guess while this sub is mainly Western you can push you agenda, but for anyone who objectively knows this stuff, even Russian culture and pop culture it won't work. Mind you, I love Russian culture. Follow many Russians on social media, have 10+ songs of said Gazmanov on my iPhone (bought on iTunes pre invasion, but NOT deleted).

But these purchases were not that significant (they still constituted a small proportion of the population).

Essentially, you're trying to justify an artificial population movement.

5513,"I'm not quite sure what you're implying but if you're saying that light features are a sign of being slavic:

Light features do not equal being slavic. Like, Finnish people and Baltic people are not slavic at all. My friend who I already mentioned, who is Komi, is not slavic, yet she is pretty much the whitest person I know - super white hair and super light skin. Komi people are distantly related to Finnish people afaik - their languages are from one language group for sure. I myself am super-white (like, literally pale like a vampire), yet my grandmother was Roma - I inherited her hair texture and eye color though. Genetics is a complicated subject.

I was probably exaggerating when I said that there is not a single one ""pure slavic"" person in Russia - statistically it is possible, but it is something that people most of the times do not keep the track of, and I do not know a genetic test that can differentiate between different historically Russian ethnicities. 

I kinda wish that if that kind of genetic test existed, every racist person in Russia would take it and oh I wish so much to see their faces when they see the results that they are not so slavic as they thought they are.

Facts are that during the Golden Horde period mongols had lots of different kinds of relationships with russians, then during the USSR period people often moved places a lot - like my own family. You can't really keep track of that. Like, I asked my friends today about their ethnicities - and many said something like ""yeah I don't really know, I heard my grandpa was Tatar, my grandma was Roma""  or ""I think my grandmother was a daughter of a nobleman and a peasant woman, on the other side I have Polish people, Kuban Cossack people and Chuvash"", etc etc, you understand my point. Not a single one answered ""yeah my parents were slavic and their parents were slavic and their parents were slavic"". I fully understand that it is not a scientific study but personal experience but there is no such study, so judging from a personal experience is all I have. And when they ask you about your ethnicity during the Census, you can basically say whatever.

But spanish politicians are experts of ""legal"" corruption.

For example, back in the day we received ""free"" laptops at schools that were ""worth"" around 200-300‚Ç¨ each.
Obviously if you knew a bit about computers you could tell right away that they were not worth even 50‚Ç¨ by just looking at the specifications.

These computers were produced by a private company affiliated with the government, it's like ""laundering"" public money into private money

This happens a lot in spain, we know them as ""chiringuitos"". Last one we had was with the European Social Fund, which was given to Spain under the pretext of creating more emplyment.

The actual title is:

&gt; **1.1 billion of EU money not spent on Danube Delta**

Which means that one billion was made available to Romania but could not be used (due to the inability of incompetent bureaucrats to absorb so much money). Very different from ""a billion was stolen""

The subtitle of the story is:

&gt; *EU-money intended for nature and environment projects disappeared into the pockets of Romanian politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats.*

which reads: *not specified amounts of money* have disappeared in the pockets of some people


You can read in the article that only 3% of the money has been paid by the EU. It is rather difficult to steal ‚Ç¨1.1 billion funding if you received only 33 millions.

Forbidden, by whom? observe as I discuss currency reform with you.

In order to withdraw troops from Germany, something i'm sure the Soviets would have appreciated, the western powers needed a stable united germany not occupation zones. To unite a country typically you need a currency. The Reichsmark was reformed as the nazi currency was so useless and lacking in value that people were avoiding the use of currency and were bartering instead, perhaps not using currency is good for a socialist system but west Germany needed a real currency.

I'm just pointing out that the reason why countries like Denmark or the Netherlands where I'm from are only so rich because of the centuries of oppression through Imperialism and now capitalism. Through controlling their government and stealing their resources.  Take for example Africa such a rich continent yet also the poorest. Or India they were flourishing before the English came and colonised it, like so many other countries that were destroyed en exploited by imperialism and still are to a certain extent. I mean I wouldn't say that companies like Nike, Apple and H&amp;M having there factories in Asia is a good thing. I mean they aren't there to help the economy that's for sure they just want to exploit labour laws. So they can make their product for as cheap as possible and make the most profit. 

I'm not claiming I know better than anyone but I'm not blind to the clear oppression that's going on through the means of capitalism. What about the Uyghurs genocide you think that has nothing to do with capitalism? You think companies like Nike aren't fully aware of what's going on in those factories but just don't care.

5892,"You're mixing multiple things up here.

1. It is not ""popular now to change gender"", rather it is **possible** now to change gender. There was crossdressing and transsexuality for ages, but it has only just started to be able to actually change physically to the gender you feel associated with.
2. While yes, a person might want to change sexuality (because their sexuality puts them in a delicate situation because of the circumstances they are in), it is not something that is changeable like a physical appearance (at least to our current knowledge). Transsexual people undergo physical alternation to match their body to their gender identity, not the opposite way (change mind to fit body) for that exact reason. Add to that the fact that most people that are not straight don't want to ""not be gay"" because of an intrinsic motivation, but rather because of outside pressure (or even force).
3. A person is not banned from stopping to be gay, because you can't stop something that didn't get set in motion. One does not **choose** to be gay or **suddenly turn** gay (or any other sexuality really), so there's nothing that can be stopped.
4. Politics doesn't ban people from trying to suppress their sexuality if they like, although this shouldn't be in ones interest (As explained before), but rather they stop the malpractice of trying to put people through therapy to change something that isn't changeable and additionally charge money for it.

And as an additional info: you're mixing up gender identity and sexuality a little bit. The difference is a concept that took me too some time to wrap my head around. Basically it can be explained like this:

* Sexuality is what (biological) gender you feel attracted to. So someone who is heterosexual (commonly called ""straight"") is attracted to the opposite sex. So Male&lt;-&gt;Female. Someone who is homosexual (""gay"" for men or ""lesbian"" for women) is someone who is attracted to the same sex, so Male&lt;-&gt;Male and Female&lt;-&gt;Female. Bisexual (or just ""Bi"", and to further extend Pansexual) is someone who is attracted to both Males and Females, regardless of their own gender. Asexual are attracted to no one.
* Gender identity is what gender you associate yourself with. Basically in your mind you feel very feminine, but you are stuck in a male body. Or you feel very masculine, but you are stuck in a female body. There's a whole lot of in-between, and it would go too far to explain every nuance, but those are the most known ones. Those people are then called transsexual, and they often cross-dress or undergo certain procedures to match their body to the gender they identify with (and NOT to change their mind to match their identity with their body).

So, if you now have a female that feels attracted to other females she is homosexual. But if she identifies as a male and undergoes surgery she turns from a homosexual female into a heterosexual male.  
That's what I mean with ""it's not all black and white"", as sexuality doesn't have very hard boundaries but rather has many grey tones and in-betweens.",,/r/europe/comments/n9woj7/uk_to_ban_lgbt_conversion_therapy_and_provide/gxufqj6/,JanB1,1620822209

But the last polling done on the issue amongst the actual Islanders back in 2013 before the Ref showed that 80% of the Islanders wanted to remain in Scotland, with only 8% supporting remaining with the UK. There's not been any polling done on the Islands since then.

Additionally, the papers misconstrued what the councillors said anyway. They said they were investigating ways to improve location power, all the way -up- to Independence, but they were primarily just seeking decentralisation of power from Holyrood to the Islands; you'll note that even the local SNP councillors were backing this motion because it was primarily a call for further local power, not a call to remain in the UK.",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/na52og/devolved_election_results_in_scotland/gxu5bnr/,Fairwolf,1620814827
