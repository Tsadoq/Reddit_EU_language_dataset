3," &gt;Lombardy was part of Austria-Hungary 

It was never part of Austria-Hungary. It was part of the Austrian Empire as a client state....for 50 years. That's nothing. Infact one of the reasons Austria-Hungary was so inefficient and dissolved was precisely *because* all its subjects were so different. Also Lombardy hated Austria during and after its time as an Austrian client state. Its like claiming Singapore and Uganda have things in common. Actually even there they at least speak English. Lombardy contains 1 sixth of the Italian population. To suggest that 1 in 6 Italians have more in common with a foreign country which doesn't even have remotely the same climate, language, political system etc. than they do with the other 5 is ridiculous. 

As for the rest of your comment wealth doesn't mean cultural connectivity....I shouldn't even need to say that its so obvious. Unless you want to suggest Finland and Japan have things in common culturally?

Spain at the time relied on the wealth from the new world to fund themselves and their own industrial/economic output suffered because instead of taking advantage of the massive productivity gains of industrialization they relied on colonial wealth. That's how they were overtaken by France and the UK when they already had a massive colonial headstart in the new world. It's called dutch disease. Spain would have likely stayed the same path relied on the same low productivity. There would be constant rebellions.

136,"&gt; The problem with 'Die heeft grote ogen' is that there's an added layer of emphasis, which isn't there with hij or zij. It's almost like you're specifically pointing at the person 'That person over there has big eyes'.

Yeah but ""diegene"" solves that.

The only real problem I see is that conventionally in Dutch when two people are referred to it seems like hij/zij always referrs to the former person and anything with ""die"" always to the latter. Like it's quite interesting but if you use ""Jan zag Piet aankomen en hij vond diens nieuwe kapsel mooi."" almost everyone would assume that John thought Pete's haircut is pretty whereas if you say ""Jan zag Piet aankomen en die vond zijn nieuwe kapsel mooi."" it seems to imply that Pete thought John's haircut is pretty.

If you say ""en die vond diens nieuwe kapsel mooi"" it even seems to imply Pete thinks their own haircut is pretty.

&gt; For a member of a disadvantaged minority, it can feel a bit much to have the pronoun you use to describe yourself feel like having so much emphasis. Obviously this isn't an absolute dealbreaker, my point is just that die, as with all the other candidates, has it's drawbacks, something that the pronoun 'they' suffers quite a lot less of.

However slightly linguistically awkward using ""die"" as neutral pronoun is it is infinitely less awkward than using ""zij"" in the plural which just produces a completely different meaning. If you say ""Jan zag Piet aankomen en ze vonden hun nieuwe kapsel mooi."" it's just a strange way to say ""en ze vonden elkaars nieuwe kapsel mooi."" like I said elsewhere in English it is also common to say ""The jury has reached __their__ decision"" whereas in Dutch you'd say ""De jury is tot __haar__ besluit gekomen"" using the singular ""her"" because Jury is a singular (feminine) noun. ""De Jurie is tot hun besluit gekomen"" is just bad Dutch. The rule to use singular agreement with singular nouns even if they refer to multiple persons is just harder in Dutch. In English you also say ""a couple of people __are__ standing there"" but in Dutch you say ""een paar mensen __staat__ daar"" using singular verbal agreement because in the end of the day ""a couple""/""een paar"" is a singular noun even though by definition it refers to multiple people.",De korthaar verdient niets dan den pijn des hellevuurs,/r/europe/comments/9bsv0t/who_french_people_think_contributed_the_most_to/e57091z/,UseTheProstateLuke,1535771633

206,"&gt;Is there an actual shared European ""identity""?

Yes, of course. Europe isn't that big (large parts of Russia belong to Asia). European cultures have been influencing each other for millennia. In the EU one can travel basically without restrictions and most of those countries share a currency (one of the few benefits of the Euro in its current state), that makes it pretty easy to travel around and get in touch. I think this is especially true for younger people, who only know this Europe.

Regarding Britons, I guess there are some historical reasons why they would not feel so much as Europeans (British Empire) and a geographical one. I really like them and their culture, doesn't matter if they leave EU (EU =/= Europe).

Edit:

The true fruits of this labor tends to only really come out in this last group (I've drunk a handful of amazing and, indeed, surprising beers of that type, but all of them were only available locally or, sometimes, in one particular bar I know that specializes in collecting rare beers - and sells them at the kind of price you'd expect), although even so I do appreciate that the ultimate fallout of this is that even a bog-standard beer will at least be ""good, if unimaginative"" (which is better than ""creative but kinda meh"", IMO).

Of course we have now finally started to see some development in microbrewing, although our commercial microbrewers are unfortunately often still stuck at the ""make the cheapest, most aggressively overhopped IPA you can concoct"" stage of development.

I do look forward to them developing past that. In the meantime I'm occassionally brewing my own, and I'll freely admit that I unabashedly follow the Belgian model of ""if it ferments, it's worth trying"" because it's just plain easier for experimental brewing if you can't spend decades refining one recipe, I just don't think that that's, in itself, cause to look down on traditional brewers.",,/r/europe/comments/9buavx/after_macrons_reaction_to_finnish_coffee_heres/e56u3ua/,Flamin_Jesus,1535764486

386,"&gt;Interesting, thanks. So because of tariffs, production will shift to inside the market, and prices won't rise as much as the tariffs? But there must be more going on here, right? An article on the first site for instance, 44% tariffs, an 8% rise in prices.

Not really no, or rather, that's one part of it, but generally it is far more complicated. Lets ignore the fact that the UK will be responsible for setting the relevant tariffs, and ignore everything bar food goods for a moment and just look at the tariff issues:

So firstly, tariffs only apply to imported goods from countries that the UK applies a tariff to. The UK may well agree to allow some quota of X good to be imported tariff free, on everything else a tariff will be applied if the UK deems it right to. Lets assume no quotas so that we don't overly complicate that - although obviously the quota of tariff free goods would further reduce price rises..)

At that point it is possible that some domestic production, or production from elsewhere becomes viable as there isn't cheaper competition from the EU. That'd mean a rise in price to the point where it is profitable for the UK producer, or a non-EU exporter, which could be well below the level of the tariff.  

That also shifts imports, it could mean that instead of importing 30% of our food from EU sources, we import 25% instead, so new tariffs now only have an impact on 25% of our food..

Now consider what the consumer actually pays, obviously the price of an item isn't just what it costs to produce, it includes a whole host of additional costs, including labour, packaging, the cost of selling it etc..  When it comes to vegetables, things like transport, storage, losses through spoil and so on, as well as the cost of staff selling it are fairly large. The tariff of course only applies to the value of the thing as it crosses the border. 

If we take white sugar, it costs something like £300 per ton, that's 30p a kilo, yet the price the consumer pays is closer to £1.10per kilo.  That price includes packaging, transport and everything else, including a profit. 

Now if that sugar were imported, and a tariff were applied, and lets say that tariff were 30%, it'd add £90 per ton to the initial cost (30% of £300 is 90£, the cost including the tariff is now £390), the so the sugar now costs 39p/kilo. If that tariff were entirely passed on to the consumer, and all other costs remained the same, instead of the consumer paying £1.10 for a kilo of sugar, they'd now be paying £1.19.  That 30% tariff became an 8% price increase.

If we took this to the extreme, and assumed a 30% increase in tariffs on everything, and everything had about the breakdown of the sugar in terms of costs (both of which is not accurate at all.. but hey..) it'd mean an 8% increase in food prices, on EU imported foods.  Assuming (again incorrectly..) that 25% of the average persons food shopping is imported from the EU (see the above paragraph on shifting suppliers, and because it's just easier to do the maths) that'd mean the average person would see something like a 2% increase in their food bill because of tariffs, that's above and beyond normal inflation of course.

Now all of that is woefully inaccurate, some food items would see much larger price spikes, some far smaller, the supermarkets would still make decisions based on consumer demand and so on. But hopefully it illustrates why even a 30% tariff doesn't lead to a 30% price rise.

Oh and its midnight, so I'm giving up here rather than talking about all the other elements that are involved, and moves that government could take to mitigate the issue.

&gt;Ah, I heard several other things, I thought, but I must have been mistaken then.

￼There is a lot of noise around, but a good rule of thumb is that if it sounds incredible (like a 30% increase in prices..) it's worth really checking, same as if someone told you that leaving the EU will drop food prices by some significant proportion immediately.. (it won't, it'll take a while for any benefits in terms of tariff shifts or anything else to work through, and even then supermarkets will still likely charge what they feel they can get away with!).

The doom and gloom out there is generally people building on worst case scenarios in a way that doesn't really make sense, and the really optimistic noises you might hear occasionally from the leave supporting side are also from people extrapolating potential benefits beyond anything sensible.  People are going to be really disappointed when we leave the EU and things don't radically change, but rather change relatively slowly, and less dramatically..",,/r/europe/comments/9bgv77/eu_to_uk_over_brexit_no_single_market_a_la_carte/e56nd7x/,ajehals,1535757037

403,"&gt;For starters I think we are looking at the word contribution differently. If you are looking at it from a numbers POV then yes the USSR is the largest contributor. However, if you are looking at what nation was most important in helping the allies gain victory over Germany in WWII than it is clearly the US. 

And not the country responsible for 80% of the German's casualties!? Get out of here!

&gt;You honestly think the Soviets would not have won had the UK and US not preoccupied large portions of the German military in Africa, Western Europe and Italy? For starters, the Germans would have been able to sure up supply lines and reinforce their troops in Stalingrad if they did not have to sure up Africa and Italy. If it was not for US supplies to the British to keep them in the fight and if it was not for the involvement of the US and UK in other fronts, the Soviets would not have survived 1943.

Possibly. Just as the US and UK could've possible won without the USSR. All of them contributing was important for the victory. As for the Soviets not surviving 1943, I find this very unlikely, even with a loss at Stalingrad. They would not surrender, they had nothing to gain from since the intentions the Germans had towards were obvious. They would've fought to the last man, and they had more men than the Germans. Eventually, Germany would've cracked even if it left the USSR totally destroyed.

&gt;That is simply not true. In WWI, the Eastern front was the largest front, but it was not the most important front. Also, taking your logic, the Pacific front was the most important front as it was the largest theater in the whole war. Also, straight up losses are not the key, but it is when they occur. The loss of manpower at Stalingrad is arguably the most important loss of German life in the whole war. However, the Soviets lost even more men and would have had a hard time recovering if the Germans and Italians didn't take the losses they did in Africa around the same time period. 

But you're not answering the main question, if you don't consider German losses in the west more important, then it's clear that the eastern front was the most important one. It saw the most troops, most fighting, most dead and was the one that turned the tide of the war in Stalingrad.

&gt;No, you have to look at what made those casualties possible. The Soviets didn't just come in and stomp the Germans. The Soviets where on the brink of collapse. Without pressure on Germany from the US and UK, the Soviets may very well have been knocked out of the war by 1943. 

What made them possible, or better put who, is the Soviet soldiers who fought against those Germans. That's who made it possible. Of course they didn't just come in stomp the Germans, though they did eventually, instead they fought a long ass battle that in the end they won. 

And the USSR falling is a again a maybe, but what I do find laughable is that you suggest that the pressure from the US and UK on Germany, without which the USSR may have collapsed, was more important than the actual fighting done by the USSR.


As an end note, I really hate how you Americans try and take credit for everything. I've even seen some try and take credit for WWI! The credit for the victory against Germany lies with all those who fought it, but mainly the USSR, just as credit for the defeat of Japan lies with who fought them, but mainly the US.",Rep.

&gt;The issue of how to control migration from Africa may have exorcised European leaders in recent years, but it could also derail the EU’s main political agreement with the continent.

&gt;Eighteen months of talks on a new agreement to replace the 2000 Cotonou accord with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries will begin in the coming weeks, with EU and African leaders far apart on how to tackle migration policy.

&gt;Despite the protestations of EU leaders – at a meeting with his African Union counterpart Moussa Faki Mahamat in May, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker stressed that “co-operation with Africa goes far beyond migration,” and was “a partnership between equals” – few observers really believe that.

&gt;The European Commission’s mantra is that the bloc’s recently established investment vehicles – the European External Investment Fund and Africa Trust Fund – intended for the African market will “tackle the root causes of migration”.

&gt;Finalised back in 2000, when migration did not scare European leaders, migration control forms only a minor part of the Cotonou pact. The agreement does include provisions requiring African countries to take back illegal migrants, but they have never been tested.

&gt;The only functioning migrant return agreement that the EU has with an African country is with Cape Verde, an island with a population of just over 500,000.

&gt;“Migration plays a relatively minor role (in the current Cotonou accord,” said Carlos Lopes, the African Union’s High Representative on the post-Cotonou talks. However, he added that “for Africa, it is important not to have a multitude of tracks” on the matter.

&gt;“The paradox in the debate in Europe is that immigration is the way they talk about Africa, even around the EU’s budget allocation, but the way the EU deals with Africa is very different in reality.”

&gt;**Negotiations on the post-Cotonou Agreement stumble on migration**

&gt;*Due to a lack of consensus on the issue of migration, member states cannot come to an agreement  on a mandate to begin negotiations on the future partnership agreement with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. EURACTIV.fr reports*

&gt;But many European countries do not want immigration to remain a marginal point in the pact any longer.

&gt;“To the EU, the main priority is migration, security, economic growth, then development,” said one Brussels-based NGO leader involved in the talks.

&gt;The EU has already signalled its intention to prioritise migration control in the next pact, by conditioning future aid and financial investment on African countries doing far more to control their borders.

&gt;“The EU’s new partnership with Africa must do more with migration [policy],” said Koen Vervaeke, managing director for Africa at the European External Action Service (EEAS), at a meeting at the Chatham House think tank in March.

&gt;**EU will spend more on border and migration control than on Africa**

&gt;*The European Commission’s proposal to bolster Europe’s borders would mean that for the first time the EU will spend more on migration control than on developing Africa, as the determination to ‘fortify’ the Continent prevails among national governments and institutions.*

&gt;Such is the preoccupation of EU countries with migration control that the bloc’s negotiating mandate on the successor to Cotonou was only agreed in late June after being held up for several months by a small group of member states led by Hungary and Poland.

&gt;The two Visegrad countries, which have been blocking any EU-wide quotas for resettling migrants from North Africa for the past two years, want the chapter in Cotonou covering readmission of would-be migrants from the ACP who are not granted leave to remain in Europe to be substantially toughened up.

&gt;In return for doing more to take back illegal migrants, EU officials are dangling the promise of easing the legal mechanisms for African migrants to legally move to Europe.

&gt;At the June European Council summit, the communique agreed by leaders talked about the need to ‘explore the concept of regional disembarkation centres.’

&gt;However, the idea of migration ‘platforms’ being hosted on African soil has so far been roundly rejected.

&gt;Morocco led the rejection of the platform concept at an African Union summit on 2 July, just days after EU leaders agreed to pursue the idea.

&gt;“It is an easy, counterproductive solution,” said Morocco’s Foreign Minister, Nasser Bourita. Instead, African leaders agreed to set up an African Observatory for Migration and Development (OAMD), which will be based in Rabat, and will focus on “harmonising the national strategies of African states and improving interaction with partners”.

&gt;However, if African leaders have so far refused to host the new centres, Faki said that the continent bore its own responsibility for the migration crisis, condemning what he described as ‘intolerable actions’ committed against African migrants on their own continent. Those words are yet to be matched by concrete actions by governments.

&gt;With more than three years of EU-African summits having produced little in the way of agreement on migration, there are few signs of the impasse being overcome inside the next 18 months of negotiations. But that would be unlikely to completely derail EU-ACP relations.

&gt;A ‘no deal’ on migration could prevent a successor to Cotonou being agreed, but wouldn’t throw out the baby with the bath water.

&gt;“Cotonou has the potential to be extended,” said Lopes.

&gt;“I would say there is no risk of no deal. It is not like Brexit. If we don’t have an agreement by 2020 then we will extend what we already have.”

&gt;**African leaders set up migration body, reject EU migrant 'platforms'**

&gt;*African leaders have announced the creation of a new body to help coordinate national policies on migration, but rejected EU plans to set up migrant “disembarkation platforms” on their soil.*",,/r/europe/comments/9bxa3p/impasse_on_migration_clouds_euafrica_relations/e56f0uu/,NeoSupaZupa,1535748678

&gt;Remember kids, it's not a conspiracy theory if the Russians did it.

Its hardly a conspiracy theory, just propaganda for naive masses to put them at ease and avoid them asking unpleasant questions (like for example, why does Russia care about so called independence movements of South ossetia and Abkhazia, while at the same time denying the same thing to Chechnya, or why did Russia seize Georgian territory in that war that was never part of South ossetia and Abkhazia control to begin with). 

Soviet union also told its people when it went into Afghanistan that they are doing some sort of of ''international duty'' or some shit (and definitely were not blatantly invading a foreign country to put it under their rule). And they also told that their troops are definitely not directly involved in Korean war in 1950's. You also believe that as well?

470,"Yes those are the four UN Security Council resolutions I referred to in my previous comment. Read them carefully. They do not recognise Nagorno Karabakh as invaded territory nor do they recognise Armenia as an aggressor nor call on Armenia to withdraw any forces from anywhere nor they call on any forces to withdraw from Nagorno Karabakh proper. They are only about the surrounding territories and regions *outside* of Nagorno Karabakh. The resolutions name these territories, regions and cities explicitly (in case you are not familiar all those names in the resolutions are outside of Nagorno Karabakh) and yet they don't on Nagorno Karabakh itself or its cities. Contrast these with [the UN Security Council resolution on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait](http://www.refworld.org/docid/3b00f12240.html) which was around the same time as the Nagorno Karabakh conflict and notice how the invading country is clearly recognised as such and called upon to remove its forces and the invaded entity is recognised as such:

&gt; Demands that Iraq withdraw immediately and unconditionally all its forces to the positions in which they were located on 1 August 1990;

507,"&gt;You hear a lot of talk about setting the tariffs to 0% or lowering them to get cheaper goods in.  This is not viable as it would destroy jobs, agriculture and production in general.

Absolutely, although obviously the tariffs that are currently applied as part of the Common Customs Tariff are not necessarily appropriate for the UK. We may well need to use tariffs to protect various aspects of the economy, but not the same ones as the EU does for the entire block. Moreover, we can set them as is required for the UK.

That obviously doesn't make sense in context of the above claim that UK tariffs will significantly increase prices, why would the UK apply tariffs to imports that are in short supply domestically, to the point that it leads to an increase in the consumer price?  

&gt;Also, when you already have low tariffs, what will the incentive be for other countries to give the UK better access to their markets?

Tariffs are only one aspect of trade deals, moreover most countries already generally have relative low tariffs.  Reducing them further or eliminating tariffs, and removing other barriers tends to be the aim of trade agreement, see CETA and the EU/Japan Partnership agreement.

&gt;Imports out of the other 27 EU countries make up far more than a small minority.

Imports generally make up a small minority of the UK economy. The value of imports into the UK in   2016 was £590m, of that £318m came from the EU, that's on a GDP of £2.61tn. For food, the UK is a major supplier, about 30% of food consumed in the UK comes from the EU (50% from the UK, the other 20% from the rest of the world). And there is a good reason for that, and that is that EU agricultural tariffs are quite high, the single external tariff makes it much cheaper to buy from France or Germany than from elsewhere.

&gt;Everything the UK EXPORTS will also be hit with those new tariffs. WTO terms aren't that great, they are rubbish even. It will not be 1%. And the consumer is going to pay.

Yes, that's how tariffs work.

But again, the estimate is that this will contribute around 1% to inflation, not 30% or anything close.  Again, tariffs are a very small portion of the consumer price for most items.  

The idea that prices will rise 30% because of brexit are absurd, not only will you not find anyone suggesting any such thing, anywhere, but there is no data that would even slightly support it.

537,"&gt; Well you said that ""on individuals level"" Russians can be way more richer, but unless you go into oligarch territory that's simply not true. 

? every city and every town in Russia or in Europe has at least 5 or 10 (if not more) people who are rich but who are not oligarch.

Number of oligarch in Russia is very limited - lets say 1000 or 2000 or or even 100 000 people (to appease you) who are connected to  government and are controling economy.

Those are ""I have yacht in Cyprus and penthouse in Spain"" rich people or oligarchs. 

Or mega-rich. I was not talking about those people.

I said (only) rich people - people who are doing well, have a nice car, have big apartment or two in their own town/city and a vacation house in the woods, can afford to go to Turkey this year and to go to Spain next year without going into debt (or something like that).

A rich person but not oligarch.

&gt; There's plenty of businessman in Lithuania too who own several grocery stores or something on those lines. One keeper of the grocery stores is billionaire, actually. 

I never said that there are no rich people in Lithuania - I said that there are rich people in Russia (not oligarchs) who are doing better than most people in Lithuania - and they exist.

What is the point of you trying to twist my words?

&gt; There's very, VERY rare. It's not impossible, 

/discussion ?

Its possible no matter how unlikely you think it is - its still a possibility.

Thats exactly what I said.

&gt; but highly unlikely for two reasons: first, Russians are generally perceived as uncultured and not really boyfriend material by Lithuanian women 

sure I understand - its something like gypsy minority in my town - they are perceived as uncultured and not really a boyfriend material etc etc 

yet sometime girls dont care and will date a gypsy, and some even marry a gypsy.

It happens.

&gt;  and secondly, moving to Russia would, again, be highly unlikely. 

not if he is well of and lives a good life in Russia.

&gt; Vice versus - yes. There's quite a number of well educated Russians moving to Lithuania recently, mainly for political reasons.

Nobody claimed that this does not happen and irrelevant to what I was saying.

&gt; So, most likely, she's married to Lithuanian, living either in Lithuania (most likely) or Western Europe (likely).

of course thats likely or highly likely - but its also possible that she married a rich russian and moved to Russia.

&gt; Your theory is as likely as her being married to Argentinian and living in Argentina. It's possible. But weird assumption to make.

Not really, because Russia is just across the border and Russians will come to Lithvania to have fun or something AND possibly meet a girl, fell in love and marry.

While same thing to happen between Argentinian and Lithuanian girl is not as likely BUT still possible.

Speculating that it could happen between citizens of bordering countries  is more realistic than speculating that it could happen between citizens of countries across the world.

If you said Poland or instead of Argentine - I would agree",EU wannabe,/r/europe/comments/9brtug/today_marks_25_years_since_the_last_occupant/e567a5l/,zenicaone,1535741737

571,"&gt; The reason why, is that Russia will now be able to close the gas line running through Eastern Europe, essentially cutting them of from a vital resource, without it influencing the sale in western Europe.

You realize what this means? It means that if Russia stops supplying the transit countries they would continue to take out gas, and in the consequence Germany would receive less gas. That's what Ukraine did in the past. And it's also one of the most important reasons to support NS2. 

Why should the energy security of Ukraine or Poland be more important than our own energy security? 

Anyway. Poland wants to stop buying Russian gas in 2022. Ukraine stopped buying in 2015. The Baltics want to stop buying, but even if they won't. The status quo for them is already that they can be cut off without affecting Western Europe, because they are supplied via Russia and Belarus.

614,"Well you said that ""on individuals level"" Russians can be way more richer, but unless you go into oligarch territory that's simply not true. There's plenty of businessman in Lithuania too who own several grocery stores or something on those lines. One keeper of the grocery stores is billionaire, actually. 

&gt;So its not impossible that she married a Russian dude and went to live to Russia.

There's very, VERY rare. It's not impossible, but highly unlikely for two reasons: first, Russians are generally perceived as uncultured and not really boyfriend material by Lithuanian women (while being from the Baltics is good if you want to get girls in Russia), and secondly, moving to Russia would, again, be highly unlikely. Vice versus - yes. There's quite a number of well educated Russians moving to Lithuania recently, mainly for political reasons.

So, most likely, she's married to Lithuanian, living either in Lithuania (most likely) or Western Europe (likely). Your theory is as likely as her being married to Argentinian and living in Argentina. It's possible.

The latter actions also caused some backlash from political opposition, accusing SDS of evading campaign finance laws.

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Juncker#Controversies

&gt;In early November 2014, just days after becoming head of the commission, Juncker was hit by media disclosures—derived from a document leak known as LuxLeaks—that Luxembourg under his premiership had turned into a major European centre of corporate tax avoidance. With the aid of the Luxembourg government, companies transferred tax liability for many billions of euros to Luxembourg, where the income was taxed at a fraction of 1%. Juncker, who in a speech in Brussels in July 2014 promised to ""try to put some morality, some ethics, into the European tax landscape"", was sharply criticised following the leaks.

&gt;A subsequent motion of censure in the European parliament was brought against Juncker over his role in the tax avoidance schemes. The motion was defeated by a large majority.

&gt;In 2017, leaked diplomatic cables show Juncker, as Luxembourg’s prime minister from 1995 until the end of 2013, blocked EU efforts to fight tax avoidance by multinational corporations.

For example that massacre of family in Podujevo, people who did that, I just can't express with words what I would do to them, scumbags who killed children deserve to rot in hell forever. I want this crime and all of the Serbian crimes to be severely punished, actually I don't care if Albanians punish their own criminals, I don't want for people like the oned who killed children to walk free among us. You should do the same, why are you looking at what Serbia is going to do? Do you want a clean conscience or you want people who killed kids in Gorazdevac for example to walk free among you? 

Both Serbs and Albanians have to face the crimes committed in their name. There are no collective guilt but the people who did that must be punished. So no dude, Serbs did not leave Kosovo on their own neither did Albanians in 1999. You have to rise above nationalistic propaganda to realize this things. 

And for Vucic, he is a scumbag, one of the people responsible for all the evils in the 90s.

 The real reason was diplomacy and money. Lithuania managed to get some sort of promise for them to leave by September 1993, and when they started to take a piss and delay, got the USA involved. Basically Russia had a choice - move troops and get 700 millions USD as promised ""technical"" aid, or don't and don't. The deadline given by the USA was 4th of October 1993. 

Also, Lithuania slowly but surely drained local Soviet forces. New recruits were not allowed to enter, and since Russia was in shambles at the moment + and never was good at doing things properly, requests were denied to be considered for such reasons as being printed on non-existent (Soviet Union) state blanks.

People argue that the USSR's contributions were written off because of the Cold War. However it could just as easily be pointed out that the contributions of the UK/US could be written off by France in an attempt to downplay their own failures earlier in the war. Show parts of Charles de Gaulle's Paris Liberation Speech to someone with zero knowledge of history and they would walk away thinking France was the only country that fought on the Western Front.

Plus there are all the issues you pointed out.

And lastly it's hard to simply divide the two fronts as separate theaters. There was significant interaction between the two theaters. German air power being diverted to protect their factories from British/American bombing raids was critical to the success of the USSR in the East. Lend-Lease was far more important than the numbers suggest. The USSR pushed the Germans back by using their superior mobility to move troops into areas of the line that were at their breaking point faster than the Germans could. That mobility came from American built trucks which were just as vital on the Eastern front as the Russian built tank. Everyone contributed and while ""The Americans came and saved the day...Eastern front...what Eastern front"" attitude it completely mythical, so is the premise of the OP as it is just as ridiculous.

851,"Not really if you pay attention to the details:  
  
At the conclusion of 1941 the British had delivered 466 tanks, 259 Valentines, and 145 Matildas, the remainder were the Tetrarch  
*Suprun, Lend-liz i severnie konvoi, p. 49, 52*  
  
The British Military Mission in Moscow reported that by 9 December approximately 90 tanks had been in action.  
*Secret Cipher Telegram, From: 30 Military Mission, To: The War Office, Reed 11/12/41, WO 193/580*  
  
The total number of British tanks in service with Soviet formations at 46 tanks on 20 December.  
*Kolomiets, M. Moshchanskiy, I. Tanki Lend-Liza [Lend Lease Tanks], (Eksprint, 2000, Moscow) p. 17*  
  
Moshchanskiy and Kolomiets indicate that during the Battle for Moscow, no more than 2% of the total numbers of armored vehicles were of British make.  
*Ibid. (I believe this is referring to the actual Soviet Offensive)*  
  
The simple fact here, is that most of the Tanks sent by the British never saw action. By December, training time on the British tanks was around 15 days, and a recommendation was made by a Soviet General that the remaining British tanks be withheld from combat because the deep snow was rendering them immobile. His recommendation was to redeploy them when the conditions actually suited them, presumably sometime after the Spring thaw.  
Forgive this citation, the title (very long) is entirely in Russian and I'm not sure if it will be correct.
*Soobrazheniia ABTU Zapadnogo fronta v Operativnii otdel Genshtaba KA po ABTU, sostavlennie na osnove opita boevikh deistvii tankovikh chastei, 19 ianvaria 1942 g., in Glavnoe avtobronetankovoe upravlenie. Liudi, sobitiia, fakti i dokumentakh—1940–1942 gg. (Moscow: GABTU, 2005), p. 168*
*N. Biriukov, Tanki – frontu! Zapiski sovetskogo generala (Smolensk: Rusich, 2005) p. 47, 53, 69*
  
So according to the actual British military mission, only 90 saw combat. A few weeks later, no doubt due to losses the number has dropped in half and of those 46 active on on Dec 20, only 8 were Matildas. The rest were presumably Valentines or possibly even Tetrarchs. I believe the most important figure in all of this is the British military missions own figure of 90.

856,"I'm just quoting something I saw the other day :

Lend Lease goods didn't arrive in Russia in meaningful quantities until after Germany had lost the strategic initiative and was being pushed towards Berlin. And even when Lend lease really picked up, it account for way less than yanks try to tell us.

&amp;#x200B;

Less than:

&amp;#x200B;

0,5% of small arms

&amp;#x200B;

1,5% of artillery platforms

&amp;#x200B;

7% of tracked vehicles (mostly British Valentines and Matildas)

&amp;#x200B;

5% of trucks (with a sharp increase to well over 10%; in the last year of the war, but by that time the war was already won)

&amp;#x200B;

The numbers for things like Aluminum, Steel, Coal, Petrol, Boots and other such neccessities is in the single %; or 0,x % digits.

&amp;#x200B;

Combat Aircraft LL was a complete shitshow, with only 11 of the 711 delivered in 41 service worthy, the rest hopelessly antiquated. Overall, the quality of lend leased goods was poor, but free shit is free shit when the Nazis are knocking on the gates.

&amp;#x200B;

So, yes. The importance of Lend Lease gets wildly exaggerated. Or, as Prof. Baumann from the Combat Studies Institute of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College puts it:

&amp;#x200B;

""Western economic aid was important but not decisive in determining the outcome of the war on the Eastern Front. Overall, these supplements were most valuable and welcome. There is no basis, however, to conclude that they were decisive in influencing the outcome of the war. ""

876,"&gt;And the people will revolt. A lot of them will die. Israel cuts humanitarian aid, energy supplies, healthcare, schools. The world will be outraged. Kids will be starving. Israel will get a reputation similar to Assad. Eventually they will surrender out of desperation. Great, now you rule a population that hates you with burning passion even more than they did before.

&gt;Your international reputation is destroyed. You resume supplies and try to keep Palestinians under control in an apartheid regime. They will revolt again and you will again have to violently surpress them. The situation will not be one bit better compared today, you will still have millions of people that hate your guts that you will have to control somehow.

What you are describing here is the CURRENT situation. We've reached that point already, and that's my point.

&gt;Why do you think the conflict is frozen for so long? It's frozen for so long, because there is simply no wait for either side to win in, where win would mean that the other side would accept defeat. You can't make Palestinians accept defeat without extremely drastic measures. And Israel cannot afford the political and economic costs of those drastic measures. It does not even want to accept them, because despite how people often demonize Israel, the Israeli society is not morally ready to start 'surrender or starve' operations against Palestinian children.

At some point the palestinians will have to accept defeat. Prolonging the fight will not make the eventual peace deal better for them, it will only make it worse. As I said, we are already in the disaster scenario you were describing. Peace would be a huge step forward, so if I were Merkel, I'd send aid, but with strings attached that it comes in only when a peace deal with Israel has been reached.",,/r/europe/comments/9bsgnw/germany_to_boost_funds_for_palestinians_after_us/e55iyhr/,Squalleke123,1535720324

The Romanian Language Day is celebrated in Romania and the Republic of Moldova, but also in the romanian communities from Ukraine, Serbia, Bulgaria and across Europe and North America. Around 28 million people in the world are speaking Romanian which makes it the 5th romance language.

Romanian has preserved a part of the Latin declension, but whereas Latin had six cases, from a morphological viewpoint, Romanian has only five: the nominative, the accusative, the genitive, the dative and marginally the vocative. Romanian nouns also preserve the neuter gender, although instead of functioning as a separate gender with its own forms in adjectives, the Romanian neuter became a mixture of masculine and feminine.

Compared with the other Romance languages, the closest relative of Romanian is Italian. The lexical similarity of Romanian with Italian has been estimated at 77%, followed by French at 75%, Sardinian 74%, Catalan 73%, Portuguese and Rhaeto-Romance 72%, Spanish 71%.

Language is very important to romanians (more important than in many other places) because it's the glue that gathered most romanians in a single state, it's the most important part of our identity. As Emil Cioran, a romanian philosopher used to say: '' ""It is no nation we inhabit, but *a language*.

Where did you find that statistic? As far as I can tell Religion isn't mentioned once in the article, neither is Muslim, Islam, or any other religious descriptor for that matter.

Are ethnic minorities overrepresented in rape statistics in Norway? Sure, and it's a problem that needs to be dealt with. But misinformation doesn't help.

927,"&gt;""Unique experience"" must be quite the understatement. La légion étrangère has a fearsome reputation. For those not familiar with French military they are the bastard child of spec ops and cannon fodder infantry. Most military corps learned not to fuck with the Legion. 
&gt;
&gt;There are several impressive stories in the Legion history which I'm sure you know. My favourite is this handful of men that held a fort somewhere in South America for no better reason than they were ordered to. They were outnumbered something like one to a hundred and the attacker basically had to give up at some point and gave the Légionnaires a free pass because ""one cannot refuse anything to such men"".


Battle of Camerone, in Mexico actually.

65 legionnaires against 2000 - 3000 mexican soldiers.


It was not a fort, it was a inn or similar large villa like building, and their basically sacrificed their lifes in order to stall the mexican army, to buy their camrades few more hours.

In fact the Mexicans won that battle.


It ended up with five legionnaires with no munition left, doing a bayonnet charge against several thousand remaining mexican soldiers.

Two of them got shot down while charging the enemy army, and the two remaining were subdued.


The mexican commmander pleaded the legionnaires to just stop fighting and throwing their lifes away. The three legionnaires responded that they would surrender only if they were allowed to leave with their weapons and equipment and their wounded lieutenant was to be taken care off.


The mexican commander granted them their wish, and when one enraged cavalry soldier withdraw his sword and tried to attack the unarmed legionnaires on their knees, the mexican commander shot the cavalry soldier dead right on the spot.

Not if it's just a token to allow you to run windows software on a microsoft-EU team designed ""vm"" feature.


&gt; Regarding the VM, a computer is similar to many other engineering devices. The fewer number of movable components the better. Having a system that runs not windows, but with an hipervisor running Windows within, but then capturing the window manager so you don’t actually show the windows desktop but the application directly, is bound to be a fuckup. And it is going to cost you significantly more, as a license to run Windows virtualized is just a regular Windows.

1259,"Glancing over a scholarly work is not recommended, and your conclusion indicates that you did not read any of the portion that explore Soviet academic studies of vagrants in the 1970s and 1980s. Here is an excerpt from that section:

&gt; As structural causes of poverty and displacement in the Soviet Union could not be acknowledged, people were assumed to have chosen their way of life. Vagrants were credited with pathological rejection of membership of social groups, demonstrated by their reluctance to form family, friendship or work-based networks. Using psychological tests, researchers strived to uncover those personality traits responsible for de-socialisation. these investigations ‘proved’ that vagrants did indeed display infantilism, a compulsion to lie, a lack of concentration and willpower and a propensity to act spontaneously, often under the influence of alcohol. It was claimed that the lack of positive parental influence, and of bonds of affection in the vagrants’ parental families, resulted in negative attitudes to family in general and to stable work. The evidence of this was seen in the apparent ease with which they changed places of living (antonian, 1984, grachev, 1984, orlov, 1986). 

&gt;Soviet authors studying vagrancy linked this transient way of life to gradual ‘physical, mental and intellectual depletion and moral degradation: vagrancy leads to pathological changes in personality linked to diminished interests and needs, indifference, “mindless” acts’ (Shakhmatov, 1979, p.12). (This is similar to the claims of some pre-revolutionary social researchers discussed earlier.) Some authors observed that: 

&gt;""constant movement … spending the nights at train stations, at boiler-rooms, in lofts and in other places unsuitable for living negatively affects the mental state of the vagrants and as a result they lose the sense of physical and psychological discomfort and lose the desire to stop this way of life."" (Grachev, 1984)

The incident occurred, Depardieu adds nonchalantly, in a bus depot; the girl, a  brunette in her early twenties, was waiting for a bus when the teenager and the nine-year old began teasing her. ""One thing led to another and, hup!!"" - Depardieu suddenly rises halfway out of his chair, like an animal bounding after prey - ""that was that."" He pauses. ""It was normal.

Depardieu returns to his chair and glances at the faces around him. He is surprised to note that they are registering something like horror. ""There was nothing wrong with it,"" he explains.

All of these things make Russia much weaker. Aid to Yeltsin was the best investment we ever made in Russia, way more profitable than McDonalds. Now that Russia is authoritarian and isolated everyone else in Europe hates Russia and want to be friends with us. The Poles, the Balts, the Czechs, the Slovaks, the Ukrainians who now hate Russia. We paid for Yeltsin's friendship, but he ended up giving us the friendship of numerous entire countries.

Greeks started in the aegean islands and peloponnese and its surrounding regions. From there they expanded everywhere from the north against thracians to crimea, italy, spain etc. 

And once again people of anatolia were slowly assimilated to the turkish culture through centuries just like how greeks did to native anatolians. By the time greece **invaded** anatolia even izmir as a province was majority turkish.

1622,"&gt;US regulation? I assume you're referring to GDPR. You're right - it was actually reasonably well-intended, but not sufficiently thought through in terms of consequences.

I was talking about the Hippa, healthcare data regulation thing for the US where you said the US regs lacked clarity.

&gt;Again, I will defer to your legal expertise here, but I am a stickler for clear definitions. I believe this is vital to ensure non-arbitrary application and interpretation of laws by prosecutors and judges. I have experienced precisely the risk calculation you fear (in the case of a nasty violation of employee rights) but the solution there isn't to keep definitions vague, but to raise fines appropriately so they actually hurt. I think there we agree, no?

Haha.... I understand what you are saying completely. Our legal culture is a lot different in the US. Besides criminal trials, we also still use jury trials all the time to fix legal damages in lawsuits in billion dollar civil trials. As in a jury of 12 random citizens selected by lot from the voting roles. Juries are finders of fact, so they calaculate damages because that’s an issue of fact. The judge just presided over the court and instructs them on law. This can even happen in local state courts with elected judges. (Lots of states have elected judges). Of course, the appellate courts look at the cases closely and the state legislatures often caps damages possible for specific types of cases.

I don’t view the law necessarily as a machine and I’m not too worried about inconsistent awards. (However the interpretation of the law is always consiststent, trial courts have to follow precedent from higher courts which provide uniformity). (Judges can overrule juries in civil trials if they are 100% crazy, but can never overrule juries in criminal trials if they vote to acquit.)


But no I don’t think it’s a big deal.  Of course, for things like embezzlement the calculation can be easy and consistent if it’s just how much money you stole, but I trust the jury. I want to make my case or defend my case from ordinary people. It’s more democratic at least. 

Of course, this could have pernicious effects on businesss if they felt the rule of law was being hurt by inconsistency, but we’ve been doing this for 400 years and the American economy keeps on growing and businesses still invest and grow. I don’t see it as a factor at all when businesses make decisions. (And they can always get liability insurance).


Prosecutors in the US are also elected, like judges. (Federal prosecutors and federal judges are appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate). 

Is is political? A bit. But it also gives government and people immense power to make changes and respond to issues. 

For example, strict products liability was introduced in a case by the Supreme Court of California in the 1950s as part of California common law. By a few years later all 50 state supreme courts had adopted the legal doctrine because they were persuaded by the economic rationale of putting the cost on producers who are in the best position to know what’s wrong with their product and make it safer. The EU directives now have products liability all from that California court because Europe adopted it after the US. Same with how class action law suits were developed in the US, and I still don’t understand why Europe doesn’t use them more widely.

But yeah, laws shouldn’t be vague, but we don’t like to regulate prescriptively. I think that in Europe it also actually hurts technological innovation by forcing firms to keep existing standards (which the government says are safe and legal.)


What’s the point of making your product safer or your process better if you’re just doing the bare minimum which the government regulations tell you to do?

There is no positive correlation between quality of life and ethnic homogeneity like you claim, ignoring the fact that this is already your strawman argument after the race one didn't work.

&gt;Historically, for sure, Europe took some time before growing strong. But then they were the first ones, and the only one so far, to manage to colonise all other continents. 

Your arguments are all riddled with fallacies. An Egyptian could have said the same thing about other races back in the day and it would have been true. So could a person from Mesopotamia before them. Of course at the time they were the most advanced peoples and no one had ever done the various things they did first, which I hope I don't to give you a list of. Our civilization today is based on all these advances in science and technology. After (majority White) Western civilization fades, there will be another another one dominating the world and most today believe it to be the Chinese. And in 300 years we'll probably have some Chinese kid who didn't pay attention in history class argue they are a superior race. 

As for the rest what you wrote: Please state clearly what your actual argument is. First you say the most developed nations are those of White people. Now you seem to have changed it to any places that has few Black people and/or isn't multiethnic. You also seem to imply that Asians are kind of white, that's why they do better. Which is it?

1747,"&gt;No, I'm saying you should and can make your own version of it.

What's the advantage of repurposing the Cyrillic alphabet instead of the Latin one?

&gt;The issue being you're not doing it.

Because there is no actual need to. The only people who consider our orthography to be cluttered are foreigners who don't know how to decipher our digraphs. If we invented new characters for our digraphs they still wouldn't be able to read them, and if we switched to Cyrillic, they wouldn't be able to read anything unless they knew Cyrillic. Then they'd face the same problems with new letters that would be unique to Polish.

Pointless.

&gt;If you decide to switch you get free reign over making an alphabet that  is completely your own and suits your own needs. If you decide to modify  latin you'd try to keep it as much the same as you possibly can.

We already have a free reign over out alphabet. I fail to see how we wouldn't try to keep the Cyrillic alphabet as intact as possible.

&gt;You didn't make your own alphabet. That's why none of them suits you  completely. But cyrillic has more letters that fit the sounds of polish  than latin and as such is a more fitting choice. That's simply because  it was made for slavic languages specifically, instead of latin.

That is utter nonsense.

First of all, the three families of the Slavic languages are vastly different in terms of phonetics. If a script is tailored to one of them, it can't be tailored to another, generally speaking. Serbs repurposed the Cyrillic alphabet to suit their needs the same way Poles and Czechs repurposed the Latin alphabet.

Second of all, letters mean whatever we decide they mean. The letter ""т"" is not any more suitable to express the voiceless alveolar stop than the letter ""t"".

Last but not least, let's count whether your claim has any merit:

​To sum up, if we were to borrow some letter from the Czech alphabet, we'd be left with just two digraphs for which we'd have to invent new characters: ""ch"" and ""dż"".

If we were to switch to the Cyrillic alphabet, we'd have to borrow some obscure letters from the Serbian alphabet, two long obsolete characters representing the nasal vowels, and on top of that - invent at least two new letters (for ""ś"" and ""ź"").

1749,"&gt; Trump also instituted steel tariffs that hurt American manufacturers who buy steel. 

I know, some of those companies were forced to lay off personnel or even close completely. Or reduce profit margins. I don't think raising steel tariffs were really that damaging as a whole, it was just Trump picking favourites (coincidentally he has some friends heavily interested in steel mills). 

&gt; And threatened to slap huge tariffs on companies that move jobs out of the country.

And this is where conservative logic has a paradox. According to US conservatives, the goal of a company is to make as much profit as possible. Fine, so then moving production outside of the country for higher margins is acceptable, right? If not, then you have realise companies also have a social responsibility (which is pretty much my stance, companies should generate as much profit as possible, BUT they also have social obligations). 

So the companies affected by the tariffs are required stay in the US and  employ people just because Trump said so, no (or they will get taxed directly)? And I guess this is somewhat a respectable stance, but then why don't conservatives regulate companies in other areas? Like environmentally or giving out shares of the profit, etc? 

&gt; And his economic policies have created a booming economy with the lowest unemployment in history for blacks and hispanics.

Okay, so I'm an economist let's debunk this fact. Trump inherited a relatively stable economy, close to the peak of its natural business cycle (I think the peak of the boom is going to be the next year). What he did is reduce taxes and regulations, so naturally the economy is getting a boost. Also, he created a huuuuge deficit and the US public debt is exploding (meanwhile he cut social spending, so most of these tax cuts are not going into the pocket of ordinary citizens). So, when the next cooling cycle/recession hits, the US will have no disposable fiscal tools to stimulate growth, especially since interest rates are very low, and soon the FED will slowly raise them - which will cool the economy and raise the price of public borrowing. 

It's like a car moving really fast, and then you remove the brakes, add some nitro and then you boast how much faster you are going. Except the corner is coming soon...

Yes, I know debt was rising under Obama, but Obama was kind of a special case, because he inherited the worst recession since 1929. He needed a stimulus package (which was already hard, because Bush already gave out tax cuts like candy). At the end of his term debt was started to slowly shrink. Then came Trump and boom, the debt now is rising even harder. (Conservatives suddenly are no longer interested in ""fiscal responsibility"".)

Not to mention tax cuts and the trickle down crap is not really effective in itself in a normal economy. 

&gt; lowest unemployment in history for blacks and hispanics.

Which is nice, but median/avg wages are not really rising. Indicating the booming economy is mostly beneficial to investors and owners, not workers. (And IIRC the unemployment was already healthy when he got elected.)

&gt; He's also spoken out against megacorporations

He spoken out against those megacorps, that hurt his feelings. Like Time Warner (the owner of CNN) got sued for the merger with ATT, at the same time he was clapping when Disney swallowed Fox (two businesses he has a very good relationship with). He is very selective in this regard, and it's not really hard to figure out which companies he hates.

&gt;uklja (Greek: Διοκλεία, Diokleia; Latin: Dioclea; Serbian Cyrillic: Дукља) **was a medieval Serb[a] state** which roughly encompassed the territories of present-day southeastern Montenegro, from the Bay of Kotor in the west to the Bojana river in the east, and to the sources of the Zeta and Morača rivers in the north. First mentioned in 10th– and 11th century Byzantine chronicles, it was a vassal of the Byzantine Empire until it became independent in 1040 under **Stefan Vojislav (fl. 1034–43) who rose up and managed to take over territories of the earlier Serbian Principality, founding the Vojislavljević dynasty.** 

&gt;There`s not really any way I can write out how absurd that ""Bosnia and Serbia have no issues"" statement is. Are you stuck in some alternate reality,where everyone is friends with serbia?

Not really, since Bosnia has  no friends, but neutral is the way to go. 

&gt;Not only do the official goverments have issues,the people themselves do.

We don't have issues with Bosnia, and even if we do, who cares, it's a failed state anyway. 

&gt; Now say Croatia has no issues with Serbia.

We do.

&gt; And while facts cant be changed,you guys will try every possible way to do it.

I wasn't talking just about rapes, but about all types of sexual assaults, including sexual harrasment and groping.

And I do not know whether it's psychologically more traumatic to be raped by a boyfriend or an ex compared to a complete stranger.

The reason why I was talking about street attacks is that I assumed that would be the type of assaults that newly arriving immigrants would engage in. And I was wondering whether they commit these crimes more likely than locals in the same age, but I don't have an answer for that. It would just be something that a common sense would tell you that they might because of the different cultural views and because of their social-economic status in Europe.

If you're directing money somewhere, it had to turn some kind of profit, monetary or not, otherwise there's a more lucrative investment opportunity you're missing out on.

Aid in the name of spreading democracy is, boiled down to its essence, payment for spreading democracy. The spread of democracy is a political profit for the democratic countries. Simple, but we've already seen that Yeltsin did jack shit for establishing democracy in Russia, and there's no way it wasn't noticeable from abroad. This simply means the gain was in something else. This right here is a pretty simple conclusion, devoid of conspiracies or dark powers. This is all I'm saying.

2062,"&gt;&gt;By lowering immigration rates      
&gt;
&gt;How exactly?       

Well it varies depending on the party but usually by setting either a maximum limit, raising the criteria needed for entry or by banning immigration from certain regions.      

&gt;&gt;increasing deportation rates     
&gt;
&gt;By what method, and who exactly is going to be deported?        

Again it varies by party but usually they are talking about increasing the deportation of legal immigrants who have committed crimes and illegal immigrants. They generally promise to achieve this by increasing border securities funding and employee numbers. Harsher punishments for crime can make it possible to deport immigrants for offences that were previously punished within the country.     

&gt;&gt;imposing stricter vetting laws     
&gt;
&gt;How is that going to look?     
 
Generally it is based on making the language and qualification criteria stricter. So the migrant must be learning the native language and be suitable for a job that the nation in question has a shortage of.     

&gt;&gt;harsher punishments for crime         
&gt;
&gt;Wait, so people in western countries are going to get harsher punishments for crimes because of immigrants? Not exactly fair.       

I think you know exactly what I meant but yes normally right wing parties are in favor of harsher punishment for crime in general.      

&gt;You see, my point is that those right wing populists generally have no fucking clue how their going to acchieve their goals. People just like to 'feel' that someone hears their complaints.

However, the refugees exist not just because of the civil war, but because the ISIS incursion, which made things a magnitude worse in the middle east and Syria/Iraq/Afghanistan in particular. To be claer, ISIS operates in those three countries, not just Syria. They are is a spiritual successor (and originally joined) Al Quaida, whose roots lead back to US operations, they trained mujahideens and Bin Laden to fight the soviet occupation in Afghanistan. Back to a few years ago, the original ISIS leaders originally met in US prison camps in Iraq; and later they managed to use the chaos+resentment sewn by Iraq/Afghanistan war to gather their forces.

We could even go about how the roots of modern wahabism, the ideological basis of sunni terror like the kind of ISIS/Al Quaida goes back to the house of Saud, who financed the modern islamist extremism by nearly infinite oil money, but that's not really the US' fault alone, France/Britain in particular had their last big, colonial fuckup there.

2096,"It's actually worse than that. What you say might even be true (i.e. a landownership might result in economic rents that can variably be siphoned off through taxation without affecting supply) - and *still* the argument would be wrong!

Why? Because as long as you can get a rent from landownership, as long as there are buildings on the land, there will be buildings on it, almost regardless of how much of the rent goes to the government.

The real estate ""user fee"" we call ""rent"" (not the economic rent from above), in equilibrium, has at least two parts: a) the discounted, annulized costs of construction and maintenance, legal fees, etc., and b) the premium going to the property owner for giving up their rights to use it (or economic rent). It is *possible* that the tax incidence of a property tax is such that it merely reduces the rent of land ownership, while not affecting the profitability of constructing new homes, and also not negating the fact that more homes = lower rental prices.

The mechanism would be that the tax would make land prices cheaper (because renting out real estate is less profitable due to the tax). Of course, that doesn't make owning or renting cheaper, since the difference goes to the government in the form of property taxes.

Either way, that need not affect the profitability of construction at all. New houses on the same land, lets say made more profitable through laxer zoning laws, would still lead to lower rental prices, or house prices.",,/r/europe/comments/9bgfx7/berlin_considers_banning_foreign_buyers_to/e53darh/,d4n4n,1535633969

She said

 
&gt;All of that hangs on the claim that she was intercepted at the pass. Investigation showed she was stopped in a bus and didn't show signs of physical distress.    

Doctors disagree. and honestly, considering the number of  proven abuses that your authorities excuses a French investigation is hardly believable. Like a child with marmalade all over his face saying that is innocent.


 


&gt;I repeat it, you are a disgusting liar. At best the situation can't be clearly decided since it is claim against claim. The thing is, one side is represented by the migrants themselves + italian press and migrant org who just took the migrants story and ran with it, and the other side is an official investigation by french authorities.    

The doctor opinion is a proof of a criminal bahavior. Videos of abuses like the woman on the train are proof , so the statement of our police when those fuckers invaded with guns a private property to perform an illegal medical test. But yes I am the liar becouse how a rital can accuse a good French policemen and be right about it? /s  



&gt;And in the end, even if your version of the story was the truth, your phrasing was ridiculous from the beginning : ""violent beatings of migrants : pregnant woman died"" suggest they beat her to death, which not even your version claims. You cannot deny that.    


Drag your pregnant girlfriend by the belly over a snow and rock filled terrain and see what happens . Being violent doesn't mean necessarily kicking him, you know that right?


&gt;I really don't see why you felt the need to make this story worse than it really is, even by your own sources, when you probably have other real misconducts to criticise french authorities for.

Becouse is not worse than it actually is. a woman died of a preventable death. She was stupid crossing a mountain in her state? Scure . Does it excuse what happened later? Hell no.

It had Infrastructure planned or already built aiming for a population of up to 4 million people when the empire desintagrated. Then famine and the spanish influenza occured, later joined by the prosecution of jews and the second worldwar, with a subsequent Landflucht afterwards. This lead to a severe backdrop of population (from over 2m around 1910-1918 down to around 1.5-1.6m in the era after the second world war).

All of this made housing somewhat cheap and also allowed the city itself to purchase and develop a lot of land for living purposes. The (from the end of the 1st world war until now) social democratic city-governments also implemented legislation to open access social housing for the middle class.

All of this developed into a situation where about half of the available housing is either controlled by the city or bound by law to offer only at a ‚self cost + 2% margin‘-price. This makes it somewhat harder for private investors to demand money at will (which is mostly a thing for institutionalized actors, while normal people renting out a flat tend to be less greedy).

Despite many attempts by conservative or ‚liberal‘ (in an european meaning) parties to undermine this concept and privatize the buildings, none of them succeeded so far. All the european policies - mostly brought on the way by, again, mostly conservative actors/parties - aiming to choke any public spending (which also affects the city) are hampering the ability to build new housing, thus allowing the prices to ramp up.

The rules you're talking about only go for like 10% if words (-ung = feminine for example) but that's the exact same in dutch. All words ending in -ing are DE. De vereniging. De verlichting etc. Your example with de boom, het boompje is 1) An easy rule that if you add -je to make it smaller it's always HET andere 2) not special to Dutch since German has the same. Der Baum -&gt; dad Bäumchen. Also notice how you have to add an umlaut because the sound changes, another example of how German is more complicated.

2262,"Not sure we're reading the same article then because I read one where you've synchronized the clock to UTC *and* you've abolished the concept of time zones, which *again* is not what I'm after.

The article (which is basically a mock piece) goes into increasingly more silly explanations as to why making international phone calls are now basically impossible or super inconvenient (because apparently you cannot send your uncle a text asking him when he's home from work/golf/whatever). Today you can, conveniently enough, ask Google what time it is in Melbourne and it will tell you. Super handy, because someone built that for you. Before/without Google you still had to look up their time zone and calculate what local time it is there. This doesn't change one single bit in UTC world except you would have to look up the solar time instead of the local time (exact same thing, different name).

So ""What is the solar time in Melbourne"" would be your new search query and it would probably reply something like ""For you it would be like 4:25"" or something similar. This reply would make sense to you because you would live in a world where you are used to midday/night being at a different cut-off point than 12:00/00:00.

UTC world even makes some international calls easier. Imagine going traveling and you want to call home... you don't have to do the time zone calculation anymore because you just look at your clock and know what time it is at home instead of remembering ""oh, was it 6 or 7 hours difference to home? and was it ahead or back?""

The entire explanation of why you cannot use AM and PM anymore is also quite silly. Lots of countries work perfectly well with using the 24-hour clock instead of the 12-hour clock. This only seems like a problem because you're used to using the 12-hour clock. This is basically an imperial vs SI units situation from what I can tell.

Also the article now says you cannot use concepts as today, tomorrow or this friday which is also false. As we still need to have time zones the day just starts at another time than 00:00 depending on your time zone (which it does today already, we just move the clock around to ""hide"" this fact). You're just used to the day starting at 00:00, you can get used to it starting at a different time.

It convolutes time tables? It does the exact opposite! It makes them super convenient! Look a time table up online or offline and you instantly know if something's open or not. You no longer have to figure out which country/region this site is based in, does it show the time in my local time or not. Same for offline media also. Even if you tied the date to the UTC clock you would still be able to make sane time tables. Today if you have a timetable that overlaps multiple days like from 17:00 to 01:00 you generally specify the day based on the first time stamp because.

It obviously necessitates changes to how you talk about time but not major changes surely. Today, tomorrow, morning, noon, evening, night, midnight works exactly as now. It would simply make it easier to talk about time with people in other countries. The rest would be pretty much the same with the exception that your noon and evening are offset from the clock by a certain amount, which you would get used to pretty quickly.

""days"" are still ""days"". It just makes it easier to figure out when someone elses day starts and ends compared to your day.

UTC world is not simpler than today but it's not harder either. It's a question of getting used to it (Like if you switched from farenheit to celcius, left to right hand drive or something else). It just makes coordinating stuff across time zones much easier and it reduces misunderstandings (""I land at 05:30"" now means the same to everyone)

Also yes it would be a massive inconvenience to a lot of people to make the switch but it has happened before in the past like when the railway was invented. Everyone had to synchronize their clocks instead of using their local time. The world seemed to move on. We've changed calendars in the past. The world still moved on. Pretty sure we can manage one more time.

That article mainly reads (to me) as an ""I don't like it because I'm not used to it"" article which tries to set up the most ridiculous conditions for its explanations and points it tries to make. It does nothing to properly explain why it's a bad idea.

The difference with Turkey is that there is more of a Persian/Islamic influence, rather than a Christian one, but it is also heavily influenced by the Eastern Roman Empire. Besides, Bosnia is (partially) Islamic, as is Albania. I wouldn't say they're not European.

&gt;  
&gt;So there are tariffs that affect some South African goods. And it can get very complicated. **For many types of agricultural products there are quotas** at zero tariffs. For others there are reduced tariffs on a certain quota and higher duties on quantities above that.

2334,"being offended is the choice of people in question. being offended does not grant you entitlement to sympathy or respect. entitlement and self victimization in the name of unfounded believes is nothing new in the western world either and garners by large the same kind of response and mockery. our Western secular Society first and foremost judges and respects Individuals based on their actions, and the conviction's which lead to that action. 

just look at the Jacksonville rhetoric which paints itself as an oppressed persecuted minority all the while yelling racist chants. 
recent neo-nazi rally in chemnitz, germany was no different, historically the alt right had a strong representation in the region and painted itself as an misunderstood, prejudiced, victim. partly because Dresden has been destroyed pretty thoroughly during WW2 and did not get the help under UDSSR occupation that Cities under Western occupation had.

We do respect and value the *RIGHT* to autonomy and beliefs, and the expression there off.

This however is not the Right to respect. and it is not right to silence or censor the beliefs which run counter to your own. 
and if my belief is that Mohammed is a cultist hack i have just as much right to express that as you have to express that Mohammed is eternal peace and love or whatever.
You and everyone else has the right to criticize me based on my belief, and if you have persuasive arguments I am happy to change my mind.

You do however have not the right to infringe on my rights of autonomy and my rights of free expression. you do not have the right to lynch me in a mob, to threaten Nuclear Jihad, or to censor me. 

And those are exactly the the kind of rules which govern Holocaust denial rhetoric Laws. they aren't censored because they are hateful Nazis. they are censored and persecuted because they want rewrite History in a light which justifies their hateful discrimination and racism, which justifies violence towards minorities like jews, muslims and all foreigners in between and beyond.

our German anti Nazi rhetoric laws are so harsh because the Holocaust is fairly recent in the grand scheme of History. Our laws don't compel anyone to adopt, or respect a belief which isn't their's. our censorship laws govern the spreading of disinformation which are morally abhorrent and ultimately lead to persecution and Violence.

There is nothing Sacred or metaphysical about these laws which is not grounded in historical fact - it's a purely pragmatic humanitarian conviction which first and foremost is meant to protect the society from hatred and violence.

Which is exactly the kind of hatred and violence these Pakistani are willing to exhibit based on criticism and mockery. this criticism and mockery does not hinder them from practicing their beliefs nor does it threaten their bodily autonomy or ability to express them self.

Yet they should feel justified to threaten violence, lynchings, and nuclear Jihad ? (and i am confident i'd get myself lynched if i voiced my criticism in a staggering large percentage of the Muslim population)

If you don't see the disconnect, hypocrisy and inequality (Nazi-rethoric-censorship vs Islam-criticism) than you deserve the mockery and criticism all the more.

2410,"Unlike Chinese characters, the Japanese kanji almost all have at least two, and sometimes up to half a dozen different pronunciations (not counting names). And you also use hiragana, katakana and latin alphabets in addition (though they're pretty easy to learn). You can write horizontally left-right, vertically top-bottom, or (fairly rare nowadays) horizontally right-left. 

The basic grammar is fairly straightforward: no plurar forms; only current and past tense; and almost all verbs conjugate completely regularly. 

But the word order feels odd to most non-native speakers; the particles get confusing; and - the biggest stumbling block when I was a beginner - Japanese often elide unnecessary parts from a sentence when you can figure it out from context. So, a conversation might go: 

""My uncle, he is retired now.""  
""Oh, old?""  
""65. Dog is only 4, worried.""  
""Die before, yes. Give/receive?""  
""Allergy. Besides, dislike me.""

Which is fine if you're an advanced speaker, but good luck trying to follow along as a beginner.

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard for most English speakers because the conjugations are very different. There is no gender, subjunctive, or imperfect in English. The gender and imperfect makes sense, but it's extremely difficult to explain the ""idea"" of the subjunctive to English speakers because they don't understand the purpose of it. With romance languages like Spanish it's not too hard to learn because the different tenses are the only real difficult part. With French, you have to learn the romance tenses and deal with the pronunciation issues.

&amp;#x200B;

To this day I can use the subjunctive in Spanish from repetition but I have no idea what the purpose of it is. Like when you say ""Espero que viva"" (subjunctif)=""I hope that he goes"", why can't you just say ""Espero que vive""(indicative)?

It makes no sense because the context of the sentence already makes it clear that you want him to live from ""Espero""=""I hope"". I have heard Mexicans tell me that the subjunctive acts as a future tense, but then why not just use the regular future tense ""Espero que vivira""=""I hope that he will live""? Or why doesn't the context just already tell you that it has to be a future tense because why on earth would you be hoping for something unless it was to occur in the future?

I'm ranting because I'm pretty sure the subjunctive has the same purpose in French, but alas. ",,/r/europe/comments/9bdzxf/how_long_for_an_english_speaker_to_become/e52wvbn/,sandyhands2,1535605345

In September 2014 in Wales (UK) the NATO states agreed on the following: All NATO countries currently spending less than 2% of their GDP on defense have to

* stop reducing their defense budget any further
* aim to increase the real defense spending within the growth of the countries GDP. (For example: A country with 1% GDP growth, and 10 billion dollar spending on defense should increase its spending by 100 million dollar - 1% of 10 billion)
* aim to move towards the 2 % guideline within a decade (thats 2024).

This agreement was a reaction to the Ukraine crisis.

The stupid 2% GDP talking point does not exist outside the US-News-cycle. Because its not a thing. There is no requirement to spend 2%. Its pure fiction. And all that was agreed long before 2016. Donald Trump was still a TV host, Obama was in office and nothing, literally nothing changed since then.

2534,"&gt;You kidding? Russia is X times bigger, has a much larger population and has a smaller GDP than Britan, that's a small island bascally.

I was talking about PPP, which far better represents production and internal consumption - obviously after the fall of Russian (and thus our) currency the nominal GDP took a hit - before that it was approaching the top rapidly. The economy didn't halve since that just because the currency fell. Didn't think I had to explain that to an Eastern European, how young are you?.. 

Anyway - we wouldn't be able to buy half the things we get from Russia at EU prices. Good example would be our Nuclear Power Plant - the other supplier would be Westinghouse - certainly not $10G - I'm too lazy to check if it would be triple or quadruple, but certainly unaffordable. It's actually a positive thing to deal with nominally ""cheap"" nation in import business. And as far as exports - we'll gladly sell to whomever is buying. 

&gt;Yup, the Spanish converted all those people, they didn't necessarily kill them. Same shit at the end of the day tbh. 

No, not the same at all. You're moving the goalposts, rather clumsily at that. They are independent nations - certainly from Spain. They have their own identity and it doesn't have to be tied to the spoken language, which only Peru has as much as a notion of having a native version of. 

Now, with us, the question is different - we've had Belarussian lessons during the Soviet times too, but it was vastly expanded since. Sure, it's not done instead of Russian like in Ukraine now, but it still provides at least a passive ability in it. For example, I have a number of friends who started speaking Belarussian during their university years *everywhere*. Public offices, stores, social gatherings... Not many can necessarily reply in that language but understanding it never caused problems, nor was there ever any hostility towards it (which absolutely exists in Ukraine due to the culture wars there). This lets us aquire other Slavic languages nearly instantly, as an added bonus, and we're doing much better than the Irish already - and all that without causing any social conflicts in the process - which lets me confidently laugh at your scaremongering with possible Russian aggression. Even first generation Russians aren't hostile to Belarussian state - a system not achieved anywhere else. 

&gt;Maybe not the government, but what about average Igor in Belarus? Does he support Russia or Ukraine? I'm pretty sure Russia. Average Joe here doesn't support the American intervention in the Middle East, at best he disagrees with it and at worst we're indifferent. 

Well, then I can confidently diagnose your society: *[drumroll]* Congratulations! You live in a dictatorship. How does it feel?

&gt;So would Belarus probably in that case and some more ex-Soviet republics. 

If that was the case - it would have happened already. We do have voting, you know ;). There's no reason to suspect our population of some hidden desire to be annexed - we're perfectly comfortable in the current situation. If we were to have a dictator appointed that completely changed our direction completely - then, probably, people would choose to join Russia. But, then again, we're in no danger of that in the first place... You might say that Russia is protecting us from getting in a situation where we'd want to join Russia ;). 

&gt;Totally, shooting down that plane full of Dutch citizens for example. Such a great way for Russia to avoid human losses. 

You're aware that it was the rebels, not the Russians, who shot down the plane which, for some hard to understand reason, was flying right over a war zone that was regularly bombarded and had warplanes shot down. Even exercise areas are blocked off, but warzone was somehow open. 

I really don't know what exactly happened there. I do believe that the primary version of Buk and all that really did happen - but how it came about in the first place is difficult to understand. No other warzone with air warfare was ever open to civilian traffic before, and the fact that Kiev kept this one open - made a lot of people quite uncomfortable, at least here. I don't know why no one in Europe asked these questions. But... If all they want is a reason to blame Russians, then these questions are superfluous. 

&gt;China doesn't want to have a sphere of influence in Europe, they are well aware it's out of their reach. For now, at least. 

But if they did, you'd gladly join it?

...it's getting pretty stupid, don't you think? 

&gt;Well, the EU can't offer more because it's about not pissing off Russia too much, since several EU countries rely on Russia for gas imports.

LOL... Give me a break! Not pissing of Russia would involve not imposing sanctions or at least not supporting Poroshenko's war machine - yet apparently it's economic assistance that would be a step too far - even though such a thing never received as much as a negative word from Russia. You're just making shit up at this point, aren't you? 

&gt;That's one of the reasons why the EU can't be trusted when it comes to defense against Russia and why the US can be trusted for that.

Yeah, they will offer great moral support...

FYI: US won't lift a finger for anyone until they ~~pay up to their military-industrial complex~~ bringing their equipment to the NATO standards and beg next to the door for a decade or so, while proving that they really don't need to be defended from anyone. The **only** exception to that rule is Israel, which has a colossal lobby there, and that's simply not repeatable.

Other than that, Americans will never agree to defend anyone who could foreseeably need to be defended. If there's a chance that mere mention of American alliance won't be enough - they won't get into it. Nothing personal, just business...

\&gt; The 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS was formed in January 1944 **via general conscription**

\&gt;  active conscription of Estonian men into the German armed forces was well under way. By Spring 1944, **approximately 32,000 men were drafted into the German forces**, with the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division consisting of some 15,000 men.

&gt; Conscription does not make belonging to the SS any less criminal because conscripts still have the personal responsibility to desert in order to avoid participating in war crimes.

Maybe yes, but Nuremberg trials came to a different conclusion.

\&gt; During the Nuremberg Trials, the Waffen-SS was declared a criminal organization for its major involvement in war crimes and for being an ""integral part"" of the SS. **Conscript units, however, were not deemed to be criminal as these individuals had no choice in becoming members.**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Tief

\&gt; During the turbulent days in September 1944, between the retreat of the German occupation forces in Estonia and the onslaught of the Red Army, the acting President of the Republic of Estonia Jüri Uluots appointed Otto Tief as a Prime Minister and asked him to form a government in 18 September 1944.

\&gt; In February 2007, the Riigikogu decided to commemorate the actions of Tief's government by proclaiming 22 September to be the annual ""Day of Resistance"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Committee_of_the_Republic_of_Estonia

\&gt; The National Committee of the Republic of Estonia was a self-styled resistance movement in German-occupied Estonia in March 1944. By April 1944 a large number of the committee members were arrested by the German security agencies.

&gt; Yes, there's a museum with 'plural' occupation, but again it still seems to be a little bit unfair with momuments: having huge wall momument with Communist crimes vs. a single bronze solider.

It's not a single bronze soldiers but also holocaust memorials like I said. Also, I agree that there is a higher emphasis at the Soviet occupation, I think it's because the Nazi occupation was 4 years and the Soviet occupation was 46 years. Also I guess the fact that modern Germany recognizes all Nazi crimes while Russia still uses the ""liberation"" word instead of annexation plays a role.

**edit:** I almost forgot that right next to that new communism victims memorial there is a huge old Soviet cemetery/memorial with division names, probably even soldier names.

Rather, it's the other way round: Locking people up all the time necessarily creates single-parent families; yet the likelihood that the children raised in them will go to jail themselves one point doesn't increase because of the single-parent structure of their families, but because at least one of their parents is a ""criminal"" who has to do time.

2714,"OFPRA is a public french agency that sent workers to process mjgrants in Spain, Italy and Greece.

It is going much more slower in Italy and it isn't always France's fault.

http://www.asylumineurope.org/reports/country/france/asylum-procedure/relocation

&gt;Italy: OFPRA applies the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Italian authorities had initially refused the placement of OFPRA officers on their territory under the same conditions as in Greece. Italian authorities make a very selective selection among asylum seekers and make very few requests France where OFPRA can examine the files.4 However, since November 2017 OFPRA has started conducting interviews with asylum seekers in Italy with a view to organising relocation.5

In 2018, France has got [more Asylum request](http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2018/08/29/01016-20180829ARTFIG00233-la-france-debordee-par-les-demandes-d-asile.php) than Italy but in the same time has accepted to take share of newly landed migrants as long as it is not the result of blackmailing.

And as several time before, France has a share of migrants from ships.

Lately [20 out 87](http://www.europe1.fr/politique/la-france-accueillera-environ-20-migrants-du-navire-open-arms-arrive-en-espagne-3729620.amp), [60 out of 141](https://www.lci.fr/amp/international/en-direct-aquarius-la-france-accueillera-60-des-141-migrants-qui-vont-debarquer-a-malte-2095569.html), [51 out of 250](http://m.leparisien.fr/amp/politique/migrants-52-refugies-du-navire-lifeline-sont-arrives-en-france-05-07-2018-7808085.php)...

So seeing Salvini painting France as not cooperating when Italy initially refused the OFPRA workers in 2015 and barely give files to work on since...

Moreover, the Italian government (well since it is a bipolar one it is hard to follow) wants to reform Dublin. Macron is fine with that. The Italian government wants more relocation, threaten to cut EU funding if others coutries don't take them, but then Salvini decide to ""ally"" himself with countries opposed to reforming Dublin and relocation... It makes perfect sense!

So currently, the little to be said about Salvini in French media doesn't help with Italy's perception in France. Good thing he is successfully antagonising one of the few countries that is aligned with Italy's requests I guess...

As if Kurtz threat's were not enough toward Italy, he is managing to sideline the country even more. Great job!",,/r/europe/comments/9badzv/macron_accepts_orban_salvini_challenge_i_will/e52c7zd/,Wikirexmax,1535583399

Yes is one of the main causes along with the ong stop policy which also was tried by Minniti but applied in stronger and more successful way by the current government.  And I say this despite the fact I am no fan of the current government .

I agree with this, but I feel it goes both ways, going back to your point of the geopolitical situation favoring Croatia and Slovenia.

You can say that they, and ultimately the other republics, abused the then geopolitical situation to their advantage to force independence and Yugoslavia's collapse.

2913,"&gt; Time change makes it automatic. Everybody will go to work one hour earlier. This is much better than each business changing their opening time in different days. 

It makes it easier for businesses that serve consumers as their customers assuming that summer and winter time are forced. On the other hand pretty much every study ever made about the subject has shown that summer time comes with at least a temporary productivity drop right after the change. This means that the set time changes don't make it better for any business but rather they make it worse. On the other hand flextime has been proven to come with a productivity increase. Putting 1+1 together would suggest that it would in fact be a lot more productive if businesses and especially individuals would make choices based on their needs rather than living by the standard set by someone else.

Now it wouldn't be too difficult to set standards for switching from summer to winter work schedule any way. Just set a date when a business is supposed to switch from being open from 5-18 to 4-17 and another date for when to switch it back if they wish to go by the current summer time idea for some reason. The fact that you are free to change things however you want doesn't mean that you have to do it differently from everyone else. All it takes is a suggested time to do so and companies will do so if it makes sense for them. However, in the end it does not make sense to do any of that summer and winter time switching as it has been proven to be a complete waste of energy and resources.

&gt; It would be dumb for your country. I'm in southern Europe...

Yea, that's my point. The whole idea of what I said was to detach your location from time completely. Then it doesn't matter whether you live in southern Europe, Northern Europe or Australia, the time would simply be the same. I mean the Earth is still going to be in the same position around the sun whether you live somewhere in Africa or in China. Why should the time be tied to where you are positioned on Earth? It makes a lot more sense to just have a set time that is based on something that is same for everyone, like say the relation of Earth and the Sun.",,/r/europe/comments/9b739a/eu_survey_over_80_percent_want_to_get_rid_of_time/e51v6df/,NameTheory,1535568903

Later it was modified and the response was often ""Death to Lachs"" (Death to Poles). 

Greeting was reintroduced by far-right groups in 90s. And gained popularity only during Majdan.

3323,"&gt; Augustus was called “princeps” not an emperor.

Oh, come one. That is pedantic nitpicking. Augustus title was ""Imperator Caesar Divi filius Augustus"".

The Principate is the first phase of the Roman Empire. Princeps was not an official title.

&gt; He was still deferring a lot to the senate.

Not really. He was trying to keep the illusion alive that the Roman Republican system still existed. Effectively, the Senate did not have much power.

""After the fall of the Roman Republic, the constitutional balance of power shifted from the Roman senate to the Roman emperor. Though retaining its legal position as under the republic, in practice, however, the actual authority of the imperial senate was negligible, as the emperor held the true power in the state. As such, membership in the senate became sought after by individuals seeking prestige and social standing, rather than actual authority.

During the reigns of the first emperors, legislative, judicial, and electoral powers were all transferred from the Roman assemblies to the senate. However, since the emperor held control over the senate, the senate acted as a vehicle through which he exercised his autocratic powers.""

3329,"Let's remove this from the entire current anti- and pro-Britain sentiments and tribalism Brexit seems to have sparked, and look at the principles behind through a thought experiment:

There is a region of forestry, further divided 3 squares in a line. The centre square is a dense forest that due to its density this forest is rapidly spreading into its two neighbouring squares. There are two groups of people living off the lumber industry in the two neighbouring squares, because of how fast the forest is spreading into them due to its density.  
There is a law that forbids any foresting in the central square, to keep its density and ensure the spread into the neighbouring squares is rapid enough to sustain the foresters.  
For some reason, this law is tied to the national budget, and is only active for the year it takes until a new budget is made.  
One year, political turmoil is dragging the budget out, and a new one isn't agreed upon before a year has passed since the last one.

One of the two groups now decide to go into the central square, and cut down as many trees as they can, until a new budget is agreed upon and it becomes illegal again.  
The other group decides to stop them from doing so, and fends them off.

Which group is morally in the right in this situation (which we'll call A)? Now lets add modifiers to the question:  
B) Group number 2 is numerically superior to group 1, does that change anything?   
C) Group number 1 isn't just ""fended off"", rather group number 2 is surrounding them to teach them a lesson, and group number 1 is violently trying to escape that, does that change anything?   
D) Now, group number 1 isn't violently trying to escape, rather they respond to group 2 by violently trying to get to the central square to do their forestry, what does that change?

My opinion, regardless of which real-world nationality is which group in the thought experiment, is that group number 2 is morally in the right in all circumstances except C, where group 1 is morally right to use violence to escape the situation, but is *not* in the moral right to want to cut down the trees in the first place.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/9b6kp6/english_fishermen_intentionally_ramming_a_french/e510y6c/,AngryArmour,1535540124

3362,"&gt;I think that we've pinpointed the problem - you don't know what ""hypocrisy"" means.

Clearly one of us doesn't. Here's Webster for you:

&gt;Definition of hypocrisy

&gt;plural hypocrisies

&gt;1 : a feigning to be what one is not or to believe what one does not : behavior that contradicts what one claims to believe or feel

&gt;His hypocrisy was finally revealed with the publication of his private letters.; especially : the false assumption of an appearance of virtue or religion

So, where in my statement did I accuse someone of either saying something they didn't believe or acted in contradiction to what they felt? Right, I didn't, so it's not a whataboutism. Pretty basic stuff.

As your bias has clearly skewed your opinion, let me use a different but equivalent example of the situation. Person A claims that vaccines cause autism. Person B refuses this and says that's not true, and actually there's no link to autism. Person C then asks for evidence from person B because they don't believe them. Person D then says that person C has taken a poor stance, because they are attacking the refute to a claim which was initially given without evidence. Person E then wades in and accuses person D of whataboutism. It's not whataboutism - there's no accusation of hypocrisy, and no attempt to deflect from the actual issue. It meets none of the criteria for being a whataboutism, other than being a fun buzzword to throw at someone to pretend their stance is illogical so you don't have to think about it.

Hope that helps. If you're ever confused over what words mean again, I can recommend half a dozen dictionaries to you.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/9b6kp6/english_fishermen_intentionally_ramming_a_french/e511351/,ColdStrain,1535540365

3398,"&gt;Germanys media isn't throwing around blatant lies (you're welcome to disprove this)

Happily. Below is a post by Kai Gniffke, the editor in cheif of Tagesschau, a news program run by the state broadcaster ARD (so publicly funded). In it he discusses why he chose not to bother covering the brutal murder of a doctor in Offenbach. In case you are unfamiliar with the case, a Somali migrant butchered (and I mean that in the literal sense) a doctor in front of his daughter for unknown reasons.

[https://blog.tagesschau.de/2018/08/18/der-toetungsfall-in-offenburg/](https://blog.tagesschau.de/2018/08/18/der-toetungsfall-in-offenburg/)

​

Let me paste here what I find to be the most telling part;

​

&gt;Wo die Meinungen auseinander gehen, ist die Frage, ob wir darüber berichten sollten, wenn es sich beim Tatverdächtigen um einen Asylbewerber handelt. Aus meiner Sicht sollten wir das dann tun, wenn Asylbewerber überproportional an Tötungsdelikten beteiligt wären. Das ist, soweit wir es recherchieren können, nicht der Fall. Deshalb haben wir uns gegen die Berichterstattung entschieden.

Allow me to translate for the benefit of those who cannot speak German

&gt;Where opinions differ is the question of whether we should report on cases which involve asylum seekers. From my point of view we should only do that if asylum seekers were proportionally over represented in crime statistics for homicides. As far as we are aware from our research, this is not the case. As a result we decided not to report on this case.

​

He states that the reason they do not report on migrant crime in general and on this horrific case in particular is because migrants are not over represented in homicide. This is clearly and demonstrably a lie. Asylum seekers were involved in 487 of 3,765 homicide cases in 2017, that is 12.9% of cases, this is despite Germany's asylum seeker population numbering 1.55 million in 2017, or 1.9% (a shockingly high number, but I digress). [https://www.nds-fluerat.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Vermerk\_IST-Zahlen\_Ende-2017\_LINKE\_Tabelle2-1.pdf](https://www.nds-fluerat.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Vermerk_IST-Zahlen_Ende-2017_LINKE_Tabelle2-1.pdf)

​

That means that an asylum seeker is roughly 6 times as likely to commit a homicide than a German.  So here we have a state run broadcasting agency deliberately underplaying migrant crime. This is by no means a one off, and is indicative of a systemic bias in the German media.

​

3577,"Very good write-up.

I would add that the tax system for small companies is so illogical and punishing that in some cases you are forced to evade the system.

For example, if you invoice someone, you have to pay the IVA (VAT) on the invoice, and then the profit tax, even if they don't pay you. The state gets the money anyways. The law says you must invoice immediately, but in a lot of cases you only invoice when you are told the money is available.

The justice system is slow, cumbersome and expensive, which also makes it less important to follow the rules - if you could use it to get your money easily, then you'd invoice everything immediately.

Barely touched is the corrosive effect of national party politics, with the regular plundering and pillaging of the public goods and waste of taxes.

In short, what we have is simply put very badly spent. Accumulate this through the years, and you have the current situation.

Also the political class has an interest in keeping the situation going, as it ensures their survival.

Finally, even if you have someone who wants to change, the next government will just change it back - and everybody knows it.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/9ayowq/european_countries_by_net_average_monthly_salary/e50u4kv/,Tuga_Lissabon,1535526098

3662,"Just compare english and ukrainian first paragraphs about massacre of Poles in Volhynia.

english:

&gt; The massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia (Polish: rzeź wołyńska, literally: Volhynian slaughter; Ukrainian: Волинська трагедія, Volyn tragedy), was an ethnic cleansing[2] (some polish scientiests think that was a genocide[3][4][5]) carried out in Nazi German-occupied Poland by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (the UPA) against Poles in the area of Volhynia, Polesia, Lublin region and Eastern Galicia beginning in 1943 and lasting up to 1945.[2] The peak of the genocide took place in July and August 1943. Most of the victims were women and children.[6] UPA's methods were particularly brutal, with many of the victims being tortured and mutilated,[7][8] and resulted in 40,000–60,000 Polish deaths in Volhynia and 30,000–40,000 in Eastern Galicia, with the other regions for the total about 100,000.[9][10][11][12]

&gt; The killings were directly linked with the policies of the Bandera faction of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN-B) and its military arm, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, whose goal as specified at the Second Conference of the OUN-B on 17–23 February 1943 (or March 1943 according to other sources) was to purge all non-Ukrainians from the future Ukrainian state.[13] Not limiting their activities to the purging of Polish civilians, the UPA also wanted to erase all traces of the Polish presence in the area.[14] The violence was endorsed by a significant number of the Ukrainian Orthodox clergy who supported UPA's nationalist cause.[15] The massacres led to a wider conflict between Polish and Ukrainian forces in the German-occupied territories, with the Polish Home Army in Volhynia[16] responding to the Ukrainian attacks.[17][18]

&gt; In 2008, the massacres committed by the Ukrainian nationalists against the Poles in Volhynia and Galicia were described by Poland's Institute of National Remembrance as bearing the distinct characteristics of a genocide,[19][20] and on 22 July 2016 Poland's parliament passed a resolution recognizing the massacres as genocide.[21][22]

Ukrainian:

&gt; The Volyn tragedy (in the Polish historiography section Rzeź wołyńska , ""Volyn massacre"") is a mutual ethnic cleansing of the Ukrainian and Polish populations carried out by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and the Polish Army Krayova with the participation of the Polish battalions of Shutsmannshafta (107, 202) [1] , and the Soviet partisans [2] in 1943 during the Second World War in Volhynia . Part of the Polish-Ukrainian confrontation in the Second World War , or, for Vyatrovich, ""The Second Polish-Ukrainian War"" [3] . In a broader sense, it is part of a centuries-old Ukrainian-Polish confrontation on Western Ukrainian lands - Volhynia , Galicia , Kholmshchyna , Pidlyashshy , Nadsyany , Lemkivshchyna .

&gt; The purpose of the Ukrainian nationalists in Volhynia was, first of all, the desire to prevent future claims of the Polish government on these lands (as it did after the end of the First World War). In addition, the disloyal UPA population was a potential pillar for Germany and the USSR . By the beginning of the summer of 1943, the UPA forces in Volhynia, according to various sources, comprised 3 to 5 thousand fighters, and at the end of the year they reached 8-12 thousand. According to the documentary records of the UPA commander Klim Savura (Dmitry Klyachkivsky) , in January-February 1944 the UPA numbered 6920 people. [4]Instead, the Polish partisan departments in the region accounted for only 1,300 soldiers, and another 3600 armed men acted in the bases of self-defense. The Polish Shuttle Police in the service of the Nazis who participated in the ""pacification"" of Ukrainian villages was about 2000, the 202nd battalion of the Polish ""pomegranate"" police arrived from the General Governorate, numbering 360 people. [4]

&gt; Traditional Polish historiography tends to be perceived as an ethnic cleansing of the entire Polish population; in Ukrainian - as a ""response"" to Poles' atrocities against Ukrainian civilians. This topic is much more researched by the Polish historians who are dealing with this problem since the end of the Second World War. [5] For the works of Polish historians, the tendency to exaggerate the Polish victims of [6] [7] [8] [4] [9] [10] [11] is characterized by the inclusion of the victims of the Poles who hid and escaped from the massacre [12 ]and by reducing the number of Ukrainian victims, count the dead Ukrainians from the hands of the Poles, as Poles who perished from the hands of Ukrainians [13] and include among the Polish victims of other people, partly not even Polish, who died in other circumstances and who did not have relation to the Volyn tragedy [14] . Ukrainian historians mostly began to explore this topic after Ukraine declared independence.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/9ayp3t/no_schools_with_ukrainian_language_left_in_crimea/e50qzdv/,iwanttosaysmth,1535520686

3801,"&gt; its not a question of whether or not an atomized individual can theoretically obtain capital. Its a question of how capital is sorted/obtained systematically, i.e. through profit, which can only exist by withholding the full value of a laborer's work from them.

You ignore the fundamental principle of monopsony power and competition. 

&gt; Also, ownership of a token share of capital is not enough to make a person a capitalist. As I clearly stated, a capitalist is someone who owns *enough capital* that they can live off of the profit generated by other workers.

A ""token"" share of apple stock in 2006 can definitely make someone wealthy. With the money I earned from my labor, I can invest into the business, and get future dividends and increases in value. 

Capital in it's economic sense ***cannot*** generate profit by itself. It needs investment. (A common misconception is that money is capital). Remember the four factors of production in econs 101?

Everyone can own capital, it is up to the person to be valued at what he's worth and receive wages. A high school dropout will earn less than a college educated person. Don't use capitalism as an excuse for your failures and that ""the world is rigged"". Each person received his/her due reward.

&gt;You just pointed to the proof, supply and demand are *tools*, not absolute natural laws.

The laws of supply and demand are as absolute as the theory of gravity. Only in certain rare cases like veblen goods. But in such cases, the theory of utility can be easily used to explain it.

3846,"I have nothing to do with the nuclear industry, but you're just quite wrong here.  
1. Radioactive waste is mostly not buried, the really radioactive/dangerous stuff sits on concrete pads in concrete and steel sealed casks, where they're safe from, like, hurricanes and stuff and can sit for many decades.  
2. Newer designs for nuclear reactors can burn spent fuel (that nasty stuff in the casks), massively reducing the lifetime of the waste to just a few centuries. They're still in development but, for instance, Bill Gates' Terrapower is explicitly aiming at this.  
3. Other new designs are much more efficient at burning uranium than prior designs, and those are much closer to commercialization (like 2025-2030). All these newer designs are basically walk-away safe and meltdown proof.  
4. The objective costs in human terms of nuclear accidents pales in comparison, per TWh, of coal and natural gas. Only one accident has had major health consequences and it was due to morons running a poorly designed reactor in a self-evidently unsafe way. The other accident that released meaningful radioactivity had more people die from the evacuation than would have died from the radiation. And it, too, was an ancient reactor we'd never build today.  


5. It's ""non-renewable"" in a very silly sense. Breeder reactors, being developed by any number of companies today, including aforementioned Terrapower, can extract 50-100x as much energy from uranium as we currently do. Moreover, there's about 4 billion tons of it in the ocean which, just last year, we found an economical way to extract it (it's still more expensive than mining but only 2x, which is about $2/MWh from the increased fuel cost). Moreover, that uranium is in chemical equilibrium with the rock, so it would be replenished (to a point) after we extract it.  


With breeders, you can provide every human on Earth at a population of 10 billion with 20kW of baseload electrical generating capacity (5x that of the US) running 24/7/365 for 4000 years just from the uranium currently in the ocean, let alone the uranium that would leach into the ocean.  


So, at minimum, we could basically make the entire world like Star Trek's Federation and run it until the year 6000; likely we could go for tens of thousands of years on top of that. So it's ""non-renewable"" in the sense that we'll run out of it further away in time longer than our species has been out of Africa.",,/r/europe/comments/9ax2jg/emmanuel_macrons_environment_minister_quits_live/e50d1h2/,nanite1018,1535505298

3848,"&gt; Then don't take issue with people pointing out that Nazis are scum then.

There is nuance to these discussions worth including. Sitting here crying about ""nazis"" isn't really much of a discussion now is it? You want to cry about nazis? Let's talk about why that is even an option for people to go with

&gt;Fascists aren't the only ones against immigration, this is not remotely true. There are shades of gray here, plenty of conservatives are against mass immigration while also not supporting literal demagogues. 

I am clearly talking about the political parties. In mainstream politics in Germany there don't appear to be many parties taking the immigration crisis as seriously as a large contingent of German society at large is. This is increasing to the point where people will become single issue voters and vote for something more extreme like what has just happened in Italy.

&gt;If the solution to your personal grievances with uncontrolled immigration is to immediately jump to Nazism then you (not you in particular, just saying in general) have no one blame but yourself if things inevitably fall to shit (as countries tend to do when fascists are in power). 

Who is jumping immediately to nazism here? I'm not going to argue with your strawmen. This is a slow process of the population becoming more extreme over time as they are politically ignored.

&gt;The responsibility would be on the populace at large for having a knee-jerk reaction, not the immigrants themselves.

They operate under a disingenuous and bad faith foundation to begin with (master race, kill/deport all minorities, etc. etc), now you want me to ""sit down"" and have a ""reasonable"" and nuanced discussion with them? When they wouldn't grant anyone that same courtesy were they in power? Really? Why do rational people have to be the ""reasonable"" ones and Nazis (once again) coddled to?

3914,"&gt;You’re skating dangerously close to racism now. Who are you to tell them what they may and may not value? These are autonomous people, and they deserve the right to self governance. Can’t you at least give them the dignity to make their own choices? Just because you don’t understand them doesn’t make them wrong. They’re not moronic savages who need saving by the noble white man.

I'm not white or ""Western"" and I never said anything about the right of self governance. Maybe you need my help with reading comprehension though. All I am saying is I have never encountered a Nigerian person like you described.

&gt;No, my parents did. And their parents did. You see, countries are built and maintained by people, and those people have kids. They pass on their values and the country their built to their kids. You seem to think these people have no right to pass on their hard work. That’s absurd. I work hard to provide a better future for my kids. I have every right to shape my country - along with my fellow countrymen - to create a society I think is best for everyone. Who gave me that right? My parents. My parents’ blood, sweat, and tears bought me that right. You seem to be arguing that parents don’t have the right to pass on their values and hard work to their kids. You’re advocating for a dark, dystopian world, devoid of family, heritage, and shared values and customs. I am very thankful that I don’t know anyone who shares your views.

That's a nice delusion but your parents did not create Denmark nor did they create the climate, the economic conditions, or choose the people where you live. You do not even have a sense of what values you hold so obviously they didn't do a very good job of passing them down. You claim to value education, yet you lack basic reading skills. You call me racist for saying that economic growth is not a value and not something that is at odds with large families - this is an easily verifiable fact that you chose to ignore.

I have family that I value but we are all individual people with our own points of view. Only sheep can say their values conform to their country or that their ""heritage"" has anything to do with what the elites in their country say it is. Nothing dark about that.

4055,"&gt; Shortages of medicine; the garden of England turned into a lorry park; a surge in red-tape; new tariffs on cars and food; factories halted for lack of parts. Those are the grim scenarios conjured up by planning for a “ no-deal Brexit”. Who in the world would volunteer for that kind of chaos? Quite a few people, as it happens.
&gt; 
&gt; There are hardline Brexiters who regard the British government’s current proposals for Brexit as a betrayal — and so would prefer no deal. There are ardent Remainers who hope that the spectre of no deal could provoke a political crisis that stops Brexit altogether. And there is the European Commission, which sees no deal as preferable to compromising on the basic principles of the single market.
&gt; 
&gt; Together, these three groups could lead the UK and the EU into no-deal territory. But they are all deluded in their own way. In their refusal to compromise they risk jointly unleashing a dangerous crisis, whose endgame they can neither predict nor control.
&gt; 
&gt; The motivations of the hardline Brexiters are, in some ways, easiest to understand. They believe that the proposal of Theresa May’s government would be the worst of all worlds: leaving Britain with the obligations of EU membership, without the supposed benefits of Brexit. But their argument that Britain should hold out for something better depends on dismissing all the warnings about no-deal as scare stories or “Project Fear”.
&gt; 
&gt; So what are the hardliners really thinking? Perhaps they believe their own propaganda and simply do not accept or comprehend the legal and regulatory consequences that flow from no deal. Maybe their reverence for Britain’s “finest hour” in 1940 has created a certain nostalgia for rationing and the “blitz spirit”?
&gt; 
&gt; But the Brexiters are surely mistaken if they believe that the chaos unleashed by crashing out of the EU would create national unity. It is more likely that Leavers and Remainers would round on each other with renewed fury, and that the political careers of many prominent Brexiters would come to an end.
&gt; 
&gt; It is this last prospect that leads one school of Remainers quietly to embrace the idea of no deal. They argue that the only way of finally discrediting Brexit and politicians like Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg is to let them have their way, and to force them to take responsibility for the results.
&gt; 
&gt; But that argument is uncomfortably close to a Marxist embrace of the immiseration of the people as a necessary condition for political progress. It also rests on the questionable assumption that an economic and social crisis would strengthen the centre ground in politics. In the real world, it is more likely to empower the political extremes.
&gt; 
&gt; There is also a milder version of the Remain case for no deal that, I admit, I have been attracted to. This rests on the hope that the May government is simply unable to negotiate a deal, or cannot get a hard-won agreement through the House of Commons. Under those circumstances, the Remainers hope that parliament would call a halt to proceedings and ask the EU for extra time to negotiate. The passage of time would make it possible to call a second referendum and Brexit might actually be stopped altogether.
&gt; 
&gt; But, alluring as that option sounds to Remainers, it is actually a very hazardous long-odds bet. There is no guarantee that the EU would be willing or able to stop the Brexit clock. And there is no guarantee that a second referendum would be won.
&gt; 
&gt; For Remainers, the more pragmatic, if depressing, option is to accept that Brexit will go ahead and to push the UK government to embrace the least-damaging version. After Brexit, economic and political logic is likely to lead Britain and the EU gradually to rebuild ties. The EU is evolving and Britain might eventually rejoin a second tier of the club focused mainly on trade and the single market.
&gt; 
&gt; But where do the EU’s interests lie? While there might be a certain schadenfreude in Brussels at the sight of the British hoarding food and stuck in massive traffic jams, chaos in the UK is not ultimately in the interests of the rest of Europe. For while the hardest economic blows would fall on Britain, there would also be serious consequences inside the EU, particularly in economically vulnerable areas like northern France.
&gt; 
&gt; A bitter rift between the EU and the UK would also be geopolitical madness at a time when Europe is under mounting pressure from Russia, China and the Trump administration in Washington.
&gt; 
&gt; The EU cannot micromanage British politics from Brussels. Nonetheless, it is clear that if the EU side forcibly and explicitly rejects the May government’s proposal — essentially that the UK stay inside the internal market for goods, but not for services — it will make a no-deal Brexit much more likely.
&gt; 
&gt; The European Commission has consistently argued that the “four freedoms” of the single market can never be divided, and that Britain must therefore choose something like the deals offered to Canada or Norway.
&gt; 
&gt; But given the unique political, strategic and economic ties between the EU and the UK, it is not unreasonable to accept that the post-Brexit relationship should also have its own unique characteristics.
&gt; 
&gt; All sides need to re-learn the art of compromise. And they do not have long to do it.

4059,"&gt;This to me feels a bit wrong and as a civilized society there should be a way of hosting a foreign group of people where the bad people are filtered out and the remainder can at least not have a bad time while they stay here.

I agree somewhat: we should filter the legit, deserving refugees out. But to me these are pretty much only women, children, pensioners and the disabled. Military aged males aren't refugees as far as I'm concerned.

And these young males are also the group driving the risk up for the people take them in. They're the ones doing the raping, murdering, the terror attacks, the knifings, the sexual assaults, the robberies, the drug dealing. 

Why even risk that? Just take the women, children etc. in (temporarily of course), there's still plenty of room to virtue signal and pat your own back with that. But at least these people won't drive the crime rates up and attack the people hosting them.

Unfortunately I don't think that approach of refugee selection is likely to become a reality any time soon. I think it's more likely that we're going to establish off-shore or closed asylum centers.

So never leaving office and conquering gaul might have been things that were forced upon him out of circumstance as much as from ambition. He was a populist, which by modern western ideals might have be an admirable trait in those times, but it's uncertain how much he believed in helping the plebeians and how much did he use populism to build a base of support for himself.

4226,"&gt;if we could produce the same amount of energy with renewables

And that's a big ""if"".

Based on the research I've done on the subject and the results of the development of  the ""new"" renewables (solar and wind) in California, renewables are not more economical, practical, and scalable than ""conventional"" means of production.

California, despite exporting as much energy as possible (they are wildly overproducing during some days as an article pointed out a week later IIRC) have seen it's energy price go up tremendously for the past years.

Why ? Because renewables don't work as a primary source of energy production. They can't be controlled, they don't produce when you need them to, so you need to have and maintain operational a secondary network of conventional means of production to balance the fluctuations. There's no realistic way of storing energy on this scale.

That's why renewables are nothing but smoke and mirrors in the case of France. They don't have any purpose. We already have a better option, nuclear power, producing around 0g of CO2 per year, controllable, well known, scalable, etc... We also have enough hydroelectric to provide the extra energy we need for peak consumption.

Also, an enriched uranium bar will deplete at close to the same rate wether you use it at 50% or 100%, therefore there's no reason **at all** to replace nuclear for renewables. It would be an exact definition of wasting money.

Renewables could be a solution for countries that rely on coal, fuel or natural gaz to produce energy, they could allow those countries to reduce their CO2 emissions.

4236,"*Humanity has weathered worse crisis before*

Really ? Could you give me some examples of destruction of the whole humankind ?

*Society has risen and fallen before, and it will happen again.*

Not this time, unfortunately, for the reasons I explained above : we have nowhere else to restart a civilisation.

*And if it doesn't? We don't matter, we have existed for a blip of time and will vanish in another blip.*

Excuse me for thinking that humankind was worth saving. 

You're talking about ""a mere heating of the planet"" ? At +2°C, it would already be a catastrophe, we're already at 1.5°C and nothing done (or so few !). It seems we take the road to +6°C to +9°C at the end of the century. A human being can not survive on wet climates when heat is too high. At 85% humidity, you start big health problems at 35°C. The human body can not survive over this limit. Countries on the equatorial line will rise to some +45°C during weeks and even months. Which is why people in India, Brasil, Bengladesh, Nigeria, Middle East, but also China because of local geography, will just have the choice between dying in 6 hours or running away. They will not just let themselves to die. 

Climate has never been so hot everywhere during the few time humans lived on the planet. It's the first, and last, time. Technology advances, that's right, but we don't know a lot about geo-engineering, like, ""cooling the planet"".

Space habitats, well, we should definitely rush to Mars before our space capacity in Florida will be submerged or no longer paid due to social emegencies.

But Mars will be in 2032 at best and I'm not sure we have so much time. Plus we will barely send 5 guys, no colonization on the long-term 'til 2100 at best. But it would be a good back-up.

I’m not and will never advocate for state communism, because it’s literally an oxymoron. 
But you have to realize capitalism isn’t the only system, and it’s not the best one either. 

Because I’m sure slaves were happy they lived in a capitalist world. Or women. Or LGBT people. Believing capitalism gives freedom to all is a naive, western neoliberal ""privatizing the national railways will make them better"" kind of sweet lie. Capitalism empowers the wealthy and bleeds the rest. 

If capitalism is so great, how come most of worker’s rights, women’s rights, LGBT rights were obtained by not following the capitalist way? 

What I’m advocating for is a stateless, moneyless society. It might be utopian, it might not. But I know that the closer we move towards it, the biggest individual freedoms will be. Because it’s sure as hell not the right wing that will give you the right to smoke a harmless plant, voice your political concerns, or simply live with dignity. 

Maybe I’m just a bit naive because my right not to be thrown in jail for who I am was acquired by other LGBT people throwing dishes at cops and being stomped on by armored police during protests. Maybe I’m just a bit naive because my right to love another man was acquired by people waving red and black, rainbow and anticapitalist flags.

Capitalism is the death of individuality for the profits of the few. Capitalism is responsible for government agencies violating everyone’s right for the sake of the collective. Capitalism is extra judiciary executions, arming of paramilitary groups to kill protesters, toppling democracies. 

Sure, maybe the URSS was worse. I don’t want to live under such a system, and it’s not the system I’m advocating for. But then maybe, when your beloved capitalism does the things you dislike the URSS for, you shouldn’t pretend it’s fine.

4417,"I'm not just calling you out for not understanding the data you posted but also for linking to a fascist conspiracy website, please don't forget that. If you think that's a trustworthy and legitimate source of information, you are deluded. 

I also want to point out that you took a thread about violent fascists promoting racist ideology and attacking police and civilians as a prompt to whatabout about supposed immigrant crime, presumably to deflect from these Nazi criminals. That is some truly disgusting behavior. Do you not care about these Nazis' victims? Do you not care that they want to undermine democracy and the rule of law? Why is it so important to you to defend violent enemies of Germany? 

But OK, I'll play if it's that important to you: you linked me the entire data set. So what data in particular do you think supports your point?

Let's note a few things in the meantime:

- The data you linked shows that refugees and asylum seekers are massively over-represented as *victims* of crime. Did you know that? I doubt it. Might that have anything to do with the criminal Nazis this thread is actually about, who you are defending and deflecting from? 

- The data shows crime is at the lowest level since reunification, i.e. since this country has existed in its current borders. Since you're blaming refugees for all changes in the crime statistics, am I to understand you that they made the country safer? 

- The data also shows a massive reduction in the number of non-German suspects compared to the last year, even more pronounced among immigrants. 

- The data show suspects, not convictions.

- Some foreign nationalities are over-represented proportionally compared to German citizens. However, this difference is explained by age, gender and socioeconomic status, in other words nationality doesn't actually make a difference if you take into account only the most basic predictors for crime, as anyone with a hint of statistical training knows you have to if you want to understand the data. There's the real truth: being male, young, poor and not highly educated all make you more likely to commit crimes. Especially being male. I assume you're not going to suggest we should limit the freedoms of men to keep society safe and would be very upset if someone suggested that all men just were naturally inclined to crime. And you'd be right to, because... 

- ... each and everyone of these variables doesn't predict a whole lot. The proportion of men/high school graduates/Russians or any other arbitrary group you could pick from these tables who are suspected to have committed a crime is vanishingly low, because Germany is one of the safest countries on earth and there simply isn't a whole lot of crime. Especially now, with the all-time record low I'm sure you haven't forgotten about. The vast majority of people in Germany, men, women, Germans and non-Germans alike don't commit any crime.",Economic migrant,/r/europe/comments/9awlye/protesters_face_off_in_tense_german_city/e4yzibx/,Steppdeckenwolf,1535460798

4420,"&gt; Hm, so you think you can rape according to a religion because somebody got married to someone in an early age, as it was normal during that era and society. Interesting.

Forced marriages of young girls still happen regularly in Pakistan. Every year many young European and North American girls are taken to Pakistan and forced to marry older men (often uncles or cousins). This is so common that, in many Western countries, initiatives are taken to inform young girls from Muslim families on what to do if they suspect that they will be abducted and forced into marriage

4518,"There are many valid reasons for Europe to question the reliability of the US as an ally under Trump.

Trump has openly proposed 'recognising' Crimea as part of Russia.
Trump has openly questioned the value of NATO.
Trump has talked about Russia being invited to join NATO!

Make no mistake that this statement from Macron is entirely in the context of Trump. With any president before Trump, this statement would have attracted much greater controversy. With Trump it seems a sensible consideration.

Some Americans do not realise the low esteem that Trump is held in in the rest of the world. He is generally viewed in the same light that people viewed corrupt, seemingly unhinged African dictators like Idi Amin or Ghadaffi.  

The fact of Trump's mental inadequacies and his equally unqualified and ethically suspect sycophantic advisors is worrying enough for Europe without the very real possibility that Trump is a Russian stooge who, (whether through blackmail or bribery), is carrying out Putin's agenda.

Even the fact that this possibility exists brings into question the wisdom of relying on a country with a political system that allows such an unstable and unreliable leader to come to power.

It really sickens me that when our government throws 2020 climate goals out of the window, noone cares but when it's about the NATO 2 % goal everyone goes all mad. We don't need to be part of NATO. In that case better pull out and use the money on something actually useful like rebuilding our schools that are falling apart.

4650,"&gt;so because neonazi disagree with goverment policy i have to agree with it or im a nazi ? 

You missed the mark so spectacularly, i cannot even find an appropriate metaphor for it. No, if a Nazi agrees with you on a political, not nazi-related cause (for instance, minimum wage), that does not make you a nazi.

&gt;Dafug 

You said it.

&gt;Dafug if you got 10 neonazis between 600 people that doesnt mean 590 are nazi.

No, but if those 600 people keep walking and protesting with those nazis, instead of kicking them out of their movement or reorganizing into a new one, that makes them nazi-enablers. 

It's a sad reality, but by now we have to have a strategy for dealing with extremists within any cause, or all politics is going to devolve into extremism and populism.

Demonstrations aren't spontaneous. There is a lot of planning behind one of those. And if I were planning a demonstration for something even as mundane as restoring the bike lanes in my city, I'd damn well make sure no Nazis come marching with me, no matter their stance on bike lanes. And If I later see news coverage of my Bike-Riders-For-Better-Lanes demonstration and notice a bunch of people doing hitler salutes, I'd either figure out a better way to keep nazis (and idiots who damage my movement by publicly exhibiting how *funny* hitler salutes are) out of it. If push come to shove, I'd end the whole thing then and there and try again later or through other means, rather than planning half a dozen further demonstrations while hoping nobody notices the growing number of nazis marching among them.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9anxvy/german_farright_street_mob_alarms_police/e4yr5yo/,sam4ritan,1535446798

right, and now try that as a middle eastern tourist.
the islamist terror attacks are media worthy but insignificant.
1/3rd of all terror since 2014, had been committed by refugees.

the others, 2nd or 3rd gens that were radicalized by IS since its rise.

the spike in attacks occurred after 2014, because of the crisis, and the rise of IS.

pre 2014 no one would have tried to use an emotional argument like yours over how they dont feel safe, because thats a shite argument, and it is one today.

the reason why it is so newsworthy for Europe, is because Europe has always been considered safe.

the US was the dangerous one.

for example, the last terror attack in NL was that of Van Gogh, more than a decade and a half ago.

Porfirogenet navodi i da je arhont bio nezavisan od bizantske politike i da je vladao u Iliriku i Panoniji
 Razlog tome je i što je Bosna rijetko ulazila u bizantske političke sfere. 
Porfirogenet ne kaže da bi se Katera nalazila u Bosni, već prema Bosni. Da je želio kazati da su to dva grada u Bosni, onda bi u tekstu stajalo “έv τό χωpῖov Bόδωvα”. U grčkom jeziku se prijedlog  ἒις koristi sa akuzativom i označava smjer, dok se prijedlog έv koristi sa lokativom i označava mjesto. Prema tome, kako Porfirogenet nije upotrijebio prijedlog έv, njegove se riječi ne mogu prevesti “i u zemlji Bosni Katera i Desnik”

4749,"Translation from the german wiki

&gt;**The regulations of the US military at that time provided for transporting injured persons to a hospital (load and go) as quickly as possible and not, as is customary in disaster medicine in Germany, sifting through injured persons on site and providing initial care.** At 4:35 p.m., an ambulance radioed in:

&gt;""We are constantly looking for burnt patients who are torn out of our hands by the Americans and transported away completely unprovided for""[14].

&gt;Due to delayed initial care, several people died or suffered permanent damage[14].

&gt;As a result of the US military's approach, dramatic scenes also took place in the clinics. A rescue helicopter involved in the rescue operations landed at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center at 6:05 pm. The emergency doctor of this helicopter described his impressions:

&gt;""We found a large number of severely burnt and seriously injured patients there who were completely unprovided for. [...] When I landed in Landstuhl, some of the most severely burnt people lay unsupplied on planks, and there were no doctors on site. After taking care of an injured person and giving the nurse who had flown with us for surveillance, I walked around the helipad of the military hospital for 10 minutes and took care of several injured people and never met an American colleague at any time""[14].

&gt;Some of the injured were taken to hospitals over long distances without care. Hours later, buses carrying people with different degrees of injury, e.g. through Mannheim in search of a clinic, still made a mistake. At 6:30 p.m., for example, a bus full of injured people arrived at the Ludwigshafen hospital some 80 km away. A doctor from the hospital:

&gt;""There were five seriously injured people on the bus. There was no doctor on this transport. Only a driver who was unfamiliar with the place and who was not German had obviously made a wandering through Ludwigshafen until he found the hospital.

This is not meant as critique, but to make clear why the disaster became such a disaster.

I consider myself relatively well informed on Moldovan politics, but that contained some gems that I wasn't aware of (For instance that Dodon was one of the MPs who crossed the floor and allowed Voronin to be removed from the Presidency, and the analysis of the political shift in Transnistria). While the article is definitely dated now, it seems rather prescient in its assessment that the Socialists would create a new pole, albeit mistaken, since the Socialists became a pole for Pro-Russian sentiment rather than Pro-European.

I'm concerned that Moldova may devolve into civil conflict following the next Parliamentary elections but if the Socialists do win by a significant margin, which with 50% of the vote (And the recent electoral reforms) seems likely, they could be win enough seats to alter the constitution and reach a political settlement with Transnistria (Autonomy). Its in their interests as the full reintegration of Transnistria back into Moldovan politics would either bolster the Socialists voter base or at least give it political allies if the Transnistrian parties participate in Moldovan elections.

Our population has increased by roughly a million people since 2010, mainly due to immigration. When poor people get houses, it's the rental apartments that go first. Like I said, it's not the only factor of the housing crisis, but it is a factor.

As for the cost, check out [this](http://projektsanning.ronnquist.com/2018/07/29/tino-sanandaji-slutnotan-for-statens-asylmottagande-landar-pa-212-miljarder-utgifter-for-en-dag-hade-rackt-till-tva-brandflygplan/) article. (The original article it quotes is paywalled). According to economist Tino Sanandaji, the initial cost of reception alone has been 212 billion SEK between 2015 and 2018. Then you get cost of welfare later on, as the majority of people who arrive as migrants simply don't have the skills to get a job in our society.


Then you have this report by Joakim Ruist: https://eso.expertgrupp.se/rapporter/tid-for-integration/

Relevant SVT interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhl4FF6wQqU

The issue is that too few immigrants work, and the ones that do work usually do so in low-wage fields. Meaning, when their time of retirement comes around, *most* haven't contributed enough taxes to pay for their own welfare, let alone create a surplus.

You should also read migrationsverket's prognosis for 2018 to 2022. It assumes that the temporary rule of temporary residence permit runs out in 2019 without renewal though.

That the number is rising (compared to previous statistics) is also a natural result of letting refugees/migrants in from countries where it was practiced.

The only way to prevent a rise in numbers is to prevent female refugees/migrants, who had been the victim of FGM in their country of origin, to enter Germany at all. Which everybody should agree to, should not be a one of the reasons why we deny asylum requests.

So yeah, 2 things that sound completely excluding each other are true at the same time:

A: The number of women who had been victims of FGM is rising in Germany and so is the ratio.
B: At the same time the chance for a woman/girl to be a victim of FGM in Germany decreased.

Because yes, the chance for a woman/girl to become a victim of FGM is lower in Germany compared to Africa.

Then you can act in the interests of the Warsaw Pact and not just in your own interests. I think our troops should lay down the ring, but your troops should control it.

4977,"US has one million Romani Americans, more than the number in Romania (not saying all Romani are Romanians to be clear, but that a lot of Romani live in Romania). Many of that population actually come from your country or the ones surrounding it originally. Most of the problem that the Romani-American community has with the rest of the US to my knowledge is that they do not like other people using the slur gypsy or having an idea of them as a mythical people. So they are pretty much fine here.

In Europe, only counting the last three hundred years to be fair for how long the US has been around, how are they treated? Depending on the country Roma could be kept in bondage through chattel slavery like blacks in America up until about the same time, rounded up and put in labor camps after their possessions were confiscated to fund their capture, their language banned, removing kids from their family to put in state schools as America did to the Native Americans and at minimum a quarter of them die in the holocaust, they are almost entirely exterminated from some countries.

In the last ten years depending on the country they are still rounded up and expelled, they are still forcibly sterilized, they are still put into separate schools of inferior quality, people attack them on the streets. How are they in a position to do well with massive poverty and societal hostility against them going back centuries? The hatred and lack of trust becomes a self-sustaining prophecy.

I don't know how to fix the problem, but piling on more problems to their community surely doesn't help. The countries where the most people are hating them, calling them asocial parasites and the like are usually where they have been treated the worst for a prolonged period of time. It doesn't seem intrinsic to the community because the ones in America are not the super criminals that all the people here seem to portray them as, the language used to describe them here sounds very familiar to how I've heard people talk about African-Americans who were similarly disadvantaged throughout history over here.",,/r/europe/comments/9an4nv/they_wanted_to_kill_us_masked_neofascists_strike/e4yh624/,sparkling_uranium,1535428935

&gt;The plan is to radically change the Bundeswehr's current focus on foreign missions by 2032. The tasks should once again focus primarily on national and alliance defence. The responsible head of department in the ministry, Lieutenant General Erhard Bühler, speaks of a ""departure from the requirements of the realignment of 2011"". 

&gt; Current mandated assignments are to be secured by the end of 2023 and additional responsibility is to be assumed between 2019 and 2023. Germany acts as a framework nation for the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force with a system network of brigades and the participation of forces from the air, sea and special forces.
&gt; 
&gt; In the second step, the first step towards comprehensive capability for alliance and national defence is to be taken by 2027, for which the task-oriented equipment for the first system networks is to be achieved.
&gt; 
&gt; The third step is to be completed with the achievement of task-oriented equipment for all active and partially/non-active units by 2031.
&gt; 
&gt; After 2032, the Bundeswehr should then be able to perform all other tasks on an equal footing on the basis of mission packages.
&gt; 
&gt; In general, simultaneity is one of the most important design parameters. The planning distinguishes between three cases of national or alliance defence:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Parallel to Alliance measures below the threshold of the Alliance case, all tasks (including other tasks to be performed on a permanent basis) must be performed with equal priority.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) National crisis preparedness must also be ensured in parallel with collective alliance defence.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. in the event of a mission in national defence, however, all other missions may be cancelled.
&gt; 
&gt; Our overview shows exactly what will change for the army, air force and navy. 
&gt; 
&gt; ## army
&gt; 
&gt; The existing structure of the army will be completely rebuilt. In future, three fully equipped divisions with eight to ten brigades are to be available, which are to be fully operational within three months. This expansion - the army currently has seven brigades and shares in the Franco-German Brigade - requires additional units, especially in the artillery battalion area. These will either be newly formed or provided by cooperation with other NATO countries.
&gt; 
&gt; The first division is scheduled to be fully operational by 2026. In this case, 20,000 soldiers could be sent into battle in three armoured brigades. By the end of 2031, the other two divisions are also to have an artillery battalion each. The personnel for this growth is also to be provided by the increased involvement of reservists.
&gt; 
&gt; The material equipment will also change massively, even if the complete consequences for planning are not yet foreseeable. According to this, the new Boxer armoured transport vehicle is at the centre of the new demand. 200 have already been made available to the army, and 130 more have already been approved. But that is far from enough, internal calculations assume that the triple amount is required - at least. Apparently, higher numbers of the new Puma infantry fighting vehicle and Franco-German cooperation in the field of artillery systems are also under discussion. 
&gt; 
&gt; ## air force
&gt; The air forces are to be put in a position to lead a multinational unit over the next 15 years. Up to 350 reconnaissance and combat missions are to be flown per day - three quarters of these were then allotted to the Bundeswehr. The concept is designed in such a way that the air forces must be in a position to maintain air dominance over Germany and to establish superiority over an operational area together with allies.
&gt; 
&gt; The air force is also to be better equipped for this. In addition, drones, C-130 Herkules transporters, further A400Ms and - completely new - also heavy transport helicopters are to be procured. The latter has never been available to the Bundeswehr before. The aim of the measures: The air force is to take over the protection of the land forces from the air as early as 2021. 
&gt; 
&gt; ## Navy
&gt; 
&gt; In future, at least 15 ships and boats are to be ready for use on the water at the same time. According to the capability profile, six tenders, four frigates and the anti-mine units would have to be replaced in the coming years. The German government is also said to have already approved the acquisition of two further supply and command ships.
&gt; 
&gt; The tasks for the Navy have also changed considerably. Among other things, it is to be put back in a position to conduct naval wars from the air. She hasn't been since she dropped off her fighter bombers more than ten years ago. It remains to be seen which measures will be taken to achieve this goal.

There are hundreds of articles about various Islamistic infiltrations in the major political parties in Sweden.

&gt;The social democrats ""eugenic roots"" is something recently brought up in SDs propaganda video about their history when even the scientist mentioned in the video wrote a article of how they where never contacted for the video and would claim the opposite if they actually would be asked.

Sources? Also, the Sweden Democrats made that movie to silence them from constantly calling them ""a party with Nazi roots"". Now, any time they claimed that, SD could simply wave the eugenics card in their face.

&gt;he said sami and finish and jewish people never can be swedish.

He said as an example that *Sami and Jewish people that don't assimilate* can never become Swedish. You don't become Swedish just because you acquire a Swedish citizenship. If I move to Japan and become a Japanese citizen, do I become Japanese? The answer is quite simply no. Many would even argue I wouldn't become a Japanese even if I fully adopted their culture, and I would agree.

&gt;Erik Almqvist which called it slurs for a man defending a immigrant that critised their party was promoted to driving their propaganda sites such as ""samhällsnytt"" online

What? Again, posting sources for your claims would help, because I can't make sense of what you're trying to say.

&gt;Kent Ekerot left the party on his own accord several years after his scandal of pushing a woman into a car and sayin ""I do whatever I want""

5109,"Finland didn't really participate in WWI. Well, sort of.

During WWI, a movement for Finnish independence was biding its time to act. At the onset of the war, Finland was still part of Russia, and there was no prospect of a Finnish victory in a potential war for independence against Russia. 

Meanwhile, some Finnish nationalists had managed to volunteer for the German army. They wanted to fight Russia, but more importantly, they wanted to receive German military training so that they could become the leaders of a Finnish army and train Finnish troops.

Eventually, Russia was so weakened by the war that Finland's autonomous Parliament issued a declaration of independence. Lenin granted Finland its independence, presumably on the basis that when Russia was reorganised as a Soviet state, Finland would join it or be retaken.

Unfortunately, the tension between the working poor and the wealthy in Finland had grown to a point where the workers and farmers had formed ""Red Guards"", paramilitary organisations that were set up in response to the paramilitary groups of the other, ""White"", faction. As you might expect, civil war broke out. Russia supported the Red faction, mostly with equipment, while the White faction was supported by Germany, including land forces. The White faction won.

So while Finland was a battleground in WWI, and started the war as part of Russia, it was basically a neutral state that ended up with a government that was supported by Germany for a while.

Anyway, my point is, it's unlikely that Finnish forces would be represented at Verdun or basically any WWI memorial. We were not really in it.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/9aq0rh/verdun_europe_25th_august_2018/e4xzwx1/,bo-tvt,1535410560

These are adults we are talking about.

The same logic applies to people that beat their wives. If a small child hits someone you explain to them why they shouldn't hit others. If a grown man from Afghanistan starts smashing his wife's head against the floor because that's how he's been indoctrinated to behave, you don't ask him to stop and then try to explain to him why he shouldn't do that. 

We are a civilized place in the west and we expect adults to behave with an understanding of basic behavior akin to not beating your family near to death.

Incidentally, our WWII was kind of crazy. 

We started out neutral, but leaning towards the Allies, only to be abandoned by them when the USSR invaded us. Germany also wouldn't help us because of Molotov-Ribbentrop (and in any case, it wouldn't have been worth it to challenge the USSR.)

Then we got a very painful peace with the USSR, losing one of the core regions of our country.

Then we started to get closer to Germany because we thought the USSR might attack us again. Germany attacked the USSR, and the USSR attacked us, so we ended up defending ourselves with German assistance (and thus, also helping Germany).

Then we lost some more and had to sign a peace treaty that compelled us to fight the Germans still in Finland, even though they had come when Germany was on our side. We drove them out, gave the USSR a lot of land again and paid heavy reparations, and our country was left in ruins.

We had been at war with the USSR twice, with the other Allied nations also technically at war with us through the second Soviet invasion. We had also been at war with Germany and its allies.

The problem is to decide what to show.       
As pointed out, a murder by a refugee which was not reported did cause a lot of critique. A murder by a german will probably not make national news at all. News-Website do want clicks and refugees is an easy topic to get them. But by showing their crimes, people will get a wrong view from reality and think that our crime is raising dramatically because of refugees (which the BKA showed is not true). Showing 'german' crime in the same volume would be stupid as well. No one wants to see that and most people simply do not care. In addition there are only a few minutes in a news show.       
But not reporting crimes causes a lot of drama by the people who want to see/show that refugees cause crime.

&gt;Poland was in alliance with France and England, Czechoslovakia wasn’t

CSR was in alliance with France and other countries, so called small entente. We were alliance with Soviets as well. Problem with that was that at the time, many western nations saw Hitler as an ally against Soviets.

&gt; Czechoslovakia wasn’t. Besides let’s be honest here, your country wasn't willing to fight

Czechoslovakia was willing and ready to fight. To the degree that the command to give up was not accepted on many places and the high command had to come to many border fortresses after the troops didn't give up and occupation forces were unable to defeat them.

The command to surrender was only after Munchen. Munchen is an example of very strong international pressure against CSR, pressure that highlighted that if CSR won't surrender, it would be viewed as an aggressor.

Also, the partisans were quite active.

You got to thank for that to France and Britain, especially Chamberlain, who pressured everyone to continue in the appeasement.

And all it's just some sort of infinite horror.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, I believe that modest petitions and rallies against raising the retirement age will not change anything. In addition, most rusaks are terribly afraid to fight for their rights, instead of this they prefer slavish obey.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, if the opinion of people not belonging to rusaks differs from the authorities' opinion, society declares them traitors, separatists and russophobes.

&amp;#x200B;

The only hope is that EU and USA sanctions will suffocate the Putler regime in the Russian Federation. Most of rusaks fanatically adores Putin's power, and this is perhaps the worst scary.

5262,"&gt; You literally just said that the abortion policy would barely affect anyone.


No, that was only the lowering of the limit. That’s not their whole abortion policy. They also want to make it possible for any doctor, nurse or clinic to refuse any woman an abortion and this affects everyone. They (or Paula Bieler) explicitly want to ”get abortions down,” so we may assume that if they were to gain power and get some of this through they wouldn’t stop there.

&gt; Frankly, I think the HBTQ people are way too coddled as it is, relative to their size. Not caring about their issues is not being anti-HBTQ.


Approximately 9% of the population is non-hetero and/or non-cis, so some kind of HBTQ persons or ”rainbow people.” That’s 1 in 11, or two to three people of your old class in school. You know a lot of HBTQ people, you just don’t know it because they haven’t told you. Not caring about their issues is perfectly fine, there are a ton of issues I don’t feel strongly about, but I’m not talking about that — I’m talking about *taking back* their rights from them, and not any ”special status rights” either, just the same rights all of us have. There’s a huge difference between not caring and wanting to cut away someone’s rights. We are talking rather fundamental rights too, having children is a very basic part of being human. Politicians shouldn’t be able to point their finger at someone and say ”You aren’t allowed to be a parent!” Being against this isn’t coddling the HBTQ community.

As for immigration, the main reason we have a housing crisis is because so few rent apartments get built, and that has been so for decades. Check out *Hyresgästföreningen* on it. I personally don’t think the immigration can possibly be such a huge money drain that it can be the reason for our housing, our schools, our healthcare, police and defence. That would mean that every immigrant would literally mean billions  (miljarder) of kronor lost. It seems unlikely. However, I agree with you that we should see full reports on all the economics of immigration, without facts politics is based on gut feeling alone, which is incredibly stupid.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/9anrdi/swedens_farright_poised_for_record_election_gains/e4xspff/,Phhhhuh,1535403715

5314,"Lol poor victim. Someone is questioning your racist views. 

You skipped over the hard questions. I specifically asked those questions because they were the ones you didn't answer. You just said there was Jewish influence in things you didn't like in a lot of different ways. I couldn't get more info out of you about based on what other than gut feel that influence was there or why things like allowing people to live where they want to live is a bad thing. When I ask why having those views is bad, you say because they benefit Jews. You say Jews can't have those beliefs for real because the ones that do are arguing for something that benefits them, but this also benefits others. We're not playing a zero-sum game. 

If arguing for something that benefits you is automatically bad, we can stop everything then. Because you're arguing for something that could benefit you and people who look like you. My beliefs are for things that could benefit everyone without limiting their freedom. This is scary globalism to you, it's basic decency for me. You've never said why it would be detrimental. 

&gt; There would be a hierarchy of ethnicities 

Already there. The idea is to not have that anymore. 

&gt; until the ethnicities had bastardized to the point where they were all medium brown English speakers. 

That'd mean the end of that hierarchy, wouldn't it? Whatever. Different kinds of cultures will keep on existing, don't worry. Cultures have always changed, don't worry. We can't forcibly preserve anything, that change happens automatically. Even if we aren't geographically isolated from each other, differences will keep on existing between areas and even between people with the same heritage. If we become space-faring, we can even become 'geographically' (space-timically?) separated again. Languages always evolve and mix and divert. Even without our scary technological progress and consequential interconnectedness, things never stayed the same. So what. With that change I'd like some progress too, more interconnectedness between humans has always meant more progress. Now we've never had the amount of interconnectedness we have today, so it's a phenomenal, unprecedented change and it's going faster than ever. It's not the kind of change you have to stop, it's the kind of change you prepare for. See that the way we've been living is not well-equipped for the future. In the blink of an eye, speaking on the scale of history, we're changing from societies build on manual labor to societies where practically no human labor will be necessary to sustain a society that will be over 10 times as big as the world population pre-industrial revolution, one where human labor will just be one of the most inefficient 'mean' of production. 

So we better start learning to live together and start getting rid of capitalism before it's catastrophic natural end due to nobody having an income anymore. But in a capitalist society, money means power, and the bourgeoisie will not give up the power they have gained through money. We need to take it from them. Abolish money before it ruins the future. Make a society where everyone gets what they need regardless of them having a job. We already produce enough food for it with barely any labor compared to just decades ago, which used barely any labor compared to decades before, et cetera. The technologies to make it sustainable are practically there, and are only held back due to monetary interests in the unsustainable old modes of power production. 

And I don't see why skin color would be relevant at all. If you're worried about genetic diversity, following from your side-comment, that increases in such a situation. New combinations will be made that weren't there before, increasing our collective survival odds. I've studied biology, that's how genetic diversity works. The bigger the group, the more diversity there is. That's how that works. So I don't really see downsides with this one small byproduct of the rapidly changing times we're living in.

This doesn't apply to the majority of refugees. Stating that the EU wants to keep the refugees no matter the cost is wrong. 

&gt; So it's just a matter of putting it in the right context. And there are plenty of news stories of how migrants are beneficial for society. How about those that are not addeding? No, worries - Germans can invest into them, so they learn the skills, or worse case scenario at least hope that their kids will be able to add to the society.

It's way cheaper and better to use legal migration for that. 

&gt; Didn't 100,000 of 350,000 that came to Germany stay? And that also doesn't mean that 250,000 went home, but lots of them migrated to other countries.

5351,"This is a fascinating article and also kind of scary how ideologically blinded some people are that they wouldn't consider a murder to be relevant news.

I've pasted the article because I know the Local has some article limits these days. I've also bolded some of what I feel are the key points.

Responsibly reporting on violent crime committed by refugees is one of the hardest things for a news organization to get right. A national broadcaster’s decision not to cover one such murder caused Jörg Luyken to take a closer look.

Do newspapers focus too much on crimes committed by refugees, thus creating an exaggerated public fear of the danger they pose? Or do they too often ignore them out of a misplaced concern that they would be fuelling racism?

Depending on who you talk to in Germany, you will get very different opinions. Left-wingers believe the press over-report, cynically exploiting the fact that refugee crime sells newspapers. The right meanwhile harangue the “politically correct” media for failing to inform the public of a growing crime wave.

As an editor who has to make calls on what does and doesn’t appear on our website, I can say it is a mighty hard call.

I am well aware of the fact that a horrific crime with an asylum seeker as the suspect - such as the rape-murder of a teenage girl in Wiesbaden in June - will bring readers to our website. In a time of declining advertising revenues, news organizations face pressure to maximize their readership.

So are we journalists pushing refugees under the bus to save our own skin? Have we awoken a latent xenophobia in the general public that helps us sell newspapers every time an asylum seeker commits a crime?

That is certainly the conclusion to draw from a statement made by German public broadcaster ARD earlier this month. ARD is publicly financed and therefore free to cover the news without fear that low ratings will drive it into bankruptcy.

On August 16th, its **Tagesschau evening news bulletin chose not to mention a grim murder in the central German town of Offenbach. A doctor had been stabbed to death in his practise that morning with no obvious explanation for why. Hours later police arrested his suspected murderer - an asylum seeker from Somalia who arrived in the country in late 2015.**

After receiving complaints from the public for its decision not to cover the crime, Tagesschau’s editor-in-chief Kai Gniffke publicly justified the decision.

He explained that **Tagesschau only reports on news that has “a societal, national or international relevance - things that are meaningful to the majority of the 83 million Germans.”**

Murders committed by refugees would only be relevant to the whole country **“if refugees are over-proportionally likely to be involved in committing homicide,” he argued. “As far as we can tell from our research, this isn’t the case - therefore we decided not to report on the crime.”**

There is a clear logic here: refugees are no more likely to murder than other members of society, therefore any national media outlet that reports on murders by refugees while ignoring other murders is giving the false impression that refugees are more dangerous than Germans.

Looking at crime figures

So is that it settled? Well, no. **A closer look at the national crime statistics shows that Mr. Gniffke's conclusion is fairly wide of the mark.**

Crime figures collected by the Federal Criminal Office (BKA) show that of a total of 785 murder cases nationwide last year, police identified a refugee or asylum seeker as a culprit in 82 of the cases.

**In other words, refugees and asylum seekers were believed to be responsible for 10.4 percent of all murders in 2017, meaning they would need to constitute over 8 million of Germany’s 83 million population to have been averagely likely to be investigated for murder.** Official figures state that Germany’s refugee population was around 1.6 million at the end of 2016 and stayed more or less stable in 2017.

So I asked Tagesschau what figures they based their research on.

A spokesperson said that a fiery debate in the editorial room had centred on the national crime statistics. Refugees were involved (either as perpetrator or victim) in 487 of 3,765 murder and manslaughter cases (12.9 percent) last year, he said, leading the editorial team to conclude that “refugees are more often involved in homicide than German citizens.”

Wait a minute. Doesn't this contradict Gniffke's official statement?

The spokesperson explained that the fact that refugees are more often involved in homicide “is from the point of view of criminologists unsurprising due to the fact that we are talking about young men who live in precarious circumstances.”

So it seems that Gniffke’s statement was actually worded rather inaccurately. What he meant to say was not that refugees are just as likely to commit crimes as Germans, but that they are just as likely to commit crimes as similar Germans.

The ARD spokesperson referred me to the work of Dr. Christian Pfeiffer, one Germany’s leading criminologists to learn more.

“At a first glance refugees are clearly over-represented in homicide cases”, **Pfeiffer told me, but comparing refugees to the rest of the population “is like comparing apples and oranges.”**

“Young men are the most dangerous people in every country in the world. **In 2014 men between the ages of 14 and 30 made up nine percent of the German population and were responsible for half of all violent crime,” he explained. “Men in this age category made up 27 percent of the refugees who arrived in 2015, this alone shows that they pose a higher risk of committing homicide than the native population.”**

What makes a murder ‘nationally relevant'?

But ARD's point of view still seems problematic, firstly because it brushes aside possible cultural factors behind crime and secondly because it ignores the relevance of the fact that 27 percent of asylum seekers in Germany are young men.

The orthodox position of **criminologists is to explain all differences in the crime statistics via either the sex, age or societal position in Germany. Academics will refer you to these factors and become quite touchy when you start to ask them about culture (as one bold red email from an academic at the Ruhr University proved to me.)**

Pfeiffer, though, said that there are certain violent crimes taking place in Germany today in which cultural background is important. He stressed that culture is not always relevant, but some murders “can only be explained through the [perpetrator's] background in a country of male dominance and honour culture.”

In the past year, three young Afghan asylum seekers have been accused of killing their girlfriends after they broke up with them. These incidents, which took place in different parts of the country appear to be of national relevance due to the fact that they suggest a wider social phenomenon.

The second reason that the **ARD justification is problematic is that it doesn't ask why 27 percent of all refugees in Germany are young men. When Germany took in over a million refugees in 2015 and 2016, it didn't take people directly from the Middle East (like Canada did). Instead it opened its land border, meaning young men were much more likely to arrive in the country.**

**Arguably, this was an irresponsible policy which the government should have known would lead to a higher murder rate.** Every single murder with a suspect who arrived as a refugee in 2015 thus becomes something of political relevance.

Criminologist Pfeiffer disputes this line of argument.

“The Chancellor needed to make an emergency decision [in 2015], it was in some sense like putting out a fire,” he says. “Canada, which took in 60,000 refugees at the time was faced with a completely different situation. They chose families to take by plane for Jordan thus avoiding the large proportion of young men that necessarily turn up when one lets refugees flow over the border after they have come across the Mediterranean.”

“Canadian politicians could come up with their policy in complete peace at their desks. Germany needed to act immediately, that is the crucial difference,” he concluded.

Not everyone sees things this way, though. Robin Alexander, political correspondent for Die Welt, has documented how Merkel was so disinterested in the refugee crisis until late 2015 that she never visited a single refugee centre during her previous decade in power. Merkel herself gave a mea culpa in parliament earlier this year, saying that she and other European leaders ignored the refugee problem until it was too late - meaning they left themselves with no choice but to open the border.

In summary: refugees are more likely to be suspected of murder. The most significant reason for this is because they are young and male. Choosing not to cover these murders means one accepts the argument that the government could not have done things differently in 2015; choosing to cover them is to give a nod to the argument that they had different policy options.

That is not an easy call to make.

Other clans are better and do normal things though; musicians, metalwork, agriculture, labour, you name it. However there are many clans that work in unsavoury buisnesses. It's very unlike other ethnic groups that we can see. No other ethnic group that I know of has this kind of internal structure with heirarchies. Some even have their own feudal system with kings and emperors. It's all quite different and convoluted.

And the cuban missile crisis for example is really just hyped up to be very bad because it gives the us government room to backlash. US secretary of state said himself that frankly it wouldn't make any difference if nukes were fired from Vladivostok or Cuba. This is also famously why when Kennedy talked about it he called it ""a political crisis"", because it was really only political. Nobody seems to remember that the US literally had nukes along the border of the USSR and weeks prior had brought more to Turkey.

5472,"Jarosław Gowin decided to talk in his private conversation with the Onet reporter about his future decision on the EU Court of Justice. The deputy prime minister said today that Poland may not recognize the verdict of the Tribunal. However, in an interview with Jonasz Jasnorzewski, he stated **that this would only happen if the CJEU granted judges the right to ""suspend"" any law.**


Jaroslaw Gowin's statement on the possible non-recognition of the judgment of the CJEU has electrified Poland
In a conversation with the Onetu reporter, the Deputy Prime Minister explained his words
**Gowin fears that the EJC will ""go ahead and succumb to pressure from the judges""**

Poland was electrified today by the words of Deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Gowin, who said that the government would not recognize the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding the questions referred for a preliminary ruling. Questions to the Tribunal were sent by the Supreme Court.

 **If the EJC allows a precedent and sanction the Supreme Court to suspend the law, then our government will probably have no choice but to lead to a second precedent, that is to ignore the ruling of the EJC as contrary to the Treaty of Lisbon and the whole spirit of European integration.** I say this with regrets as a supporter of integration. The European Union is a bold and far-reaching project, but it can only survive as a Europe of homelands - said the deputy prime minister with the weekly ""Do Rzeczy"".

He supported his position as Deputy Prime Minister in the morning broadcast in the Radio Trójka, as well as later, answering questions during a conference organized by the National Center for Research and Development. But after the incident, Jarosław Gowin in an interview with Onet explained that he meant something completely different. **The deputy prime minister argued that the government would not accept the ruling of the Tribunal only if it gave general right to judges to replace the Constitutional Tribunal and to ""suspend"" any law.**

Jaroslaw Gowin fears that the CJEU will ""go ahead and succumb to pressures from the judges"", who, according to the deputy prime minister, in their appeals to the CJEU, demand for such a right. Gowin stressed that if the CJEU ruling would only refer to specific laws and would not provide the Polish Supreme Court with an instrument to ""suspend"" any law, it would be the first person in the government that would comply with the ruling.

**Public reaction test?**

The deputy prime minister himself says that from the beginning of his speech in an interview for ""Do Rzeczy"" they had such an overtone. Let's check - Jarosław Gowin, when asked by a journalist about the preliminary ruling of the CJEU, replies that the government will ignore the ruling if the Tribunal sanctioned the suspension of the law by the Supreme Court.

If you read these words several times, you can actually understand that Gowin is only concerned with the situation in which the Tribunal gives the Supreme Court the right to suspend the acts. But Govin's thought sounds so enigmatic that the interpretation that most readers made - that the government will not recognize the ruling, even if it concerns a specific, individual case - is also legitimate.

The question is why the deputy prime minister decided to rectify the message that went into the world and explain ""what did the poet mean""? Was it really a better understanding of whether it was a test of public reaction to the possibly most severe of all closures of the government with the European Union. The test that Gowin has just decided to finish, calming the situation and soothing the tone of his words?

Jarosław Gowin: it would undermine the confidence of European citizens in EU institutions

Earlier, the Deputy Prime Minister said in the Radio Three that if the CJEU sanctioned the suspension of three articles of the Act on the Supreme Court, ""this would undermine the confidence of European citizens in EU institutions"".

At the beginning of August, the Supreme Court (SN) issued five questions for a preliminary ruling to the CJEU and suspended the application of three articles of the Act on the Supreme Court determining the rules for the retiring of judges of this court. Today, TVN24 reported that the EU Court of Justice started examining the Supreme Court's request.

Before the information about the start of the CJEU's application of the Supreme Court's application appeared, Gowin assessed that the judges had the right to refer questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. - **But in addition, these judges suspended the validity of the Act, despite the fact that the Polish constitution does not know such an institution as the suspension of the act - he said.**

**According to him, if the European Community sanctioned the attitude of these judges, ""de facto it would be the end of democracy in Poland, we would pass into the oligarchic system"". - If you sanction the position of five judges, any other group of judges could suspend the validity of democratically enacted other acts - said the deputy prime minister.**

Gowin was asked what would happen if the CJEU sanctioned this suspension of the law, and the Polish government did not recognize it. - Would it be a step to Polexitu? - the journalist asked. Gowin assured that in such a situation Poland would enter into dialogue with the CJEU. - This is not a step towards Polexit. But on the part of TS it would be an action that would very much undermine it.

Gowin was asked what would happen if the CJEU sanctioned this suspension of the law, and the Polish government did not recognize it. - Would it be a step to Polexit? - the journalist asked. Gowin assured that in such a situation Poland would enter into dialogue with the CJEU. - This is not a step towards Polexit. But on the part of the ECJ it would be an action that would greatly undermine the confidence of European citizens in EU institutions - he said.

He pointed out that Eurosceptic sentiments are growing in Western European countries. - This is a very dangerous phenomenon and from the point of view of European and Polish interests - he assessed. - **I, and our entire government, are deeply convinced that Poland's membership in the EU serves Poland's interests well. However, the question is what the Union will be - he said. He asked if the EU would be the Europe of homelands, and thus the platform for cooperation between sovereign nation states, or whether the EU would be a superstate.**

Part of the distrust towards the WE stems from the actions of France and the UK pre-WW2. It left a mark in this region that is just a part of our national psyché now.

Actually, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Yugoslavia all signed the Tripartite act and were all promised lands from their neighboring countries if Germany won. 

Additionally, Germany signed a pact with Denmark to sit back while Scandinavia was attacked. 

Finland signed the anti-comintern pact in 1941 to ally themselves with the Germans. 

So you, see, it's not so black and white.

plus

&gt; *“In the coming months, it will be increasingly difficult to reduce the number of unemployed, as more and more people among those registered are long-term unemployed who are very difficult” to bring back to the labor market [...]*

I don't know how it works, but wouldn't it be good to perhaps provide initial training to the workers? I mean, to me, it seems that people want to work, but they are deemed unqualified by the employers and therefore left out. So what if the employers would employ them and provide them with a crash course/1 month initial training before they would begin doing the actual job? Are there any reasons why this wouldn't work? I can understand that a worker on full-time training wouldn't generate much, if any at all, profit to the employer, but in the long run, it would work out. The employer would have a worker who's up-to-date with the market's and the employer's standards.

Of course, I'm not talking about positions where *extended*/specific knowledge or previous work experience is required for a position: Software developer or finance manager, accountant for example. But I think it would work for other in-demand, perhaps physical jobs?

5671,"If I were the Council, I would consider a declaration by the government to ignore EU laws and procedures as an A50 notice. It's true many states take steps that are not legal under EU rules, but there's a path that can be taken to correct any potential breach: you go to the courts, you make the argument for your case and you follow the verdict or appeal it if it's possible. No matter the issue or the country that sues the EU (or the other way around) court decisions are followed because when countries joined the EU they agreed to jurisdiction of EU courts. It also ensures that EU law works - otherwise everyone would break it, which would be detrimental to all member states and the EU.

If Poland ignores the ruling, it won't just ignore the EU law - it will ignore the EU itself. It means that Poland will no longer consider not just the law, but also institutional ways of solving conflict, as applicable to it. They may unilaterally breach other EU rules, such as ones regarding free trade. If the EU lets it slide, it will open a Pandora box of states ignoring parts of EU law, therefore making the EU pointless. 

This is why it's so important to make Warsaw state its intentions clear. If the Council receives a message from Polish authorities that they won't follow the law even after courts, that both sides said they'd accept, say they have to follow the law, then it means Polish authorities no longer wish to take part in the EU, or to use A50 language: ""decide to withdraw from the Union"".

Korean and Vietnam wars both involved the commies fighting the west. The former involved direct confrontation between UN and the PRC, the latter involved direct (airborne) confrontation between western forces and the USSR. There were plenty of exchanges throughout the cold war between western and eastern forces, it's just in every occasion one except the Korean war one or both parties pretended that they weren't there in order to allow the fight to continue without the spicy boom booms going flying.

That required a law which is why the parliament was asked.

Soviets being alarmed doesn't mean nuclear war almost happened.  Yes, we were close to nuclear war, but the likelihood of it actually happening remained small.

As for Reagan, historians (example: Beth Fischer) generally agree that the Pentagon had to force him to participate in those exercises at all, because he regarded the whole idea of nuclear war as insane, and that his reaction to the Able Archer exercise in particular was one of the factors that led him to begin talks with Gorbachev about disarmament.",USA,/r/europe/comments/9amsry/27_august_1961_two_weeks_after_the_construction/e4wrj5z/,Ai795,1535367586

First and foremost, you have to remember the history. Most colonisers were Scots. We can go deep down into history, but for the sake of brevity I won't. The British (Union) certainly committed atrocities, so please don't think this an attempt to whitewash history, but the history is a Scottish/Irish story with the English playing a secondary role via the mechanisms of the Union.

Thats why Glasgow is a cesspit of sectarianism, and England is almost completely immune despite having just as high a proportion of Irish or Irish descent people living in it. Talk sectarianism to somebody in England and they'll look at you like a caveman, but do the same in Glasgow and you're risking your life.

I had it explained to me that the SNP is basically equivalent to a reverse invasion of Scotland by Irish descent Scots, while the 'natives' remain ardent unionists. I know those are broad strokes but thats the jist of it. 

Anyway, put yourself in the Irish shoes. You've emerged from the crash and ECB waterboarding, whilst managed to retain your position as an offshore tax haven for the EU. Brexit may mean hundreds of financial jobs to boost the financial sector. Life's good.

What advantage would there be in incorporating an economically Stalinst region, officially unofficially run by heavily armed paramilitary religious fanatics, especially when such ascension would certainly mean some level of armed conflict?

5800,"&gt; Which is precisely the case on most government worker organizations... even when its not, your superior (who is supposed to evaluate your work) is just another one in a sea of workers, and is far easier for him to just not give a fuck about performance since higher up in the chain he is just a blimp in the radar.

Literally the *exact* same thing can be said at any huge corporation.

&gt;There's hardly no accountability and feedback from customers/market to force changes on the public sector, whereas on the private if incompetence happens across the chain your business will eventually fail.

Not true at all. Plenty of private sectors have profit margins so large that even if a huge portion of workers are incompetent, lazy, and make mistakes, they still turn a profit.

Hell, when they reach those sizes they often just use lobbying to get around actually competing properly.

&gt;People are really touchy when it comes to government workers (as the downvotes on my previous comment shows), I'm just completely against the two tier system, where if you have a government job you get stability for life whereas on the private sector it is increasingly easier to fire someone.

I've only ever worked for the Danish government, and people were fired for low performance in my department.

Perhaps it's different wherever you're from, but it has nothing to do with government vs private. I guarantee you that any fortune 500 company has *the exact* same problems that government bodies do.

&gt;Sure you can be incompetent on any type of organization, and the fear of getting fired does not necessarily makes one more productive (probably the opposite is true), but we need to stop protecting government workers and ensure that every worker has the same rights.

That's exactly what we are doing. The problem is that government workers usually have more rights because government often leads by example.

The minimum wage is a great example. It's set as a bare minimum, but the government very rarely pays anybody the absolute minimum ... in the private sector though, they'd pay you €1/hour if they could get away with it.

In the government there is often a human factor taken into consideration. You don't often have that in the private sector, because the only thing that matters is the bottom line.

Sure, your immediate manager might care, but he's not making the calls when upper management decides that people need to be fired so they can outsource the division to Vietnam, India, or whatever.",,/r/europe/comments/9age6o/the_french_continue_to_be_the_most_productive/e4wnxuj/,upvotesthenrages,1535359942

5804,"&gt; Good grief, this comment and your comment history are making my eyes bleed. Put down the thesaurus. 

To be clear: just because you feel uncomfortable with words with three or more syllables, that doesn't make other people ""elitist snobs"": it makes you a sad little crab in a bucket looking to use Reddit template insults borrowed from American culture to cut someone down. Language is beautiful, wilful stupidity and ignorance isn't.

That, combined with your deeply pathetic inspection of my comment history makes you really the epitomy of a neckbeard. Since we're into Reddit talk now.

&gt; On topic: Presuming innocence is also useful for the general public, who do not have the professional obligation to do so, in order to avoid panicked witch hunts now and in the future. 

I explained very carefully why this assessment isn't anything like a ""panicked witch hunt"". 

&gt; It's a good habit to develop for a culture. 

Anything somebody like you thinks is a good habit likely isn't.

&gt; Also, presuming guilt 

This, again, sidesteps the entire explanation given earlier and deliberately ignores the strength of prima facie evidence against Brecht.

Since this doesn't involve jailing Brecht, I am more than comfortable with that.

&gt; Why on earth would you interpret /u/Roller95's comment to mean that? More self-gratification, I suppose. 

More armchair psychoanalysis.

If you're white knighting on behalf of a pedo, make sure you do a stellar job.

Otherwise, you'll be wrong and ít'll look extremely bad on you.

You may have the last word, because I really don't like your ilk, and I've wasted enough minutes of my day on you already.

The criminalization of smuggling has reduced those numbers to about 1,000 people a week now, according to I.O.M. figures.",EU nation: /r/acteuropa,/r/europe/comments/9amwh5/europe_benefits_by_bankrolling_an_antimigrant/e4wlgh7/,DFractalH,1535354448
