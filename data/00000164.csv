BERLIN   — Nontraditional and upstart political parties are threatening   established, centrist parties across Europe, as returns from the   European Parliament election underscored this week. Their rise is [eating away](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/world/europe/european-elections-results.html?module=inline) at an increasingly endangered political establishment.

Adding   to the uncertainty is a generational divide clearly visible in the   voting, in which the Greens drew significant support from younger   voters.

Germany is no exception.

A national election is not scheduled until 2021, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she [intends to serve out her full term](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/world/europe/merkel-legacy-germany.html?module=inline).   But in the aftermath of the European vote, the two parties in  Germany’s  governing coalition are frustrated and weakened, and  speculation is  rising over how long their unpopular government can  last.

Support  for both the chancellor’s  conservative party and its center-left  partners declined in the  election. The chancellor’s party, the Christian  Democrats, lost five  seats, earning only 28.9 percent of the vote.  Their partners, the  Social Democrats, endured their worst national  showing ever, with  support from only 15.8 percent of the voters.

The   Greens pushed the Social Democrats into third place in Germany. They   finished behind the Christian Democrats, with 20.5 percent of the vote,   and drew large numbers of voters in western and urban areas, as well as   younger people who think the conservatives have failed to uphold their   commitments to international climate accords.

The   far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, won slightly less than 11   percent of the vote, a little less than its showing in 2017 national   elections. Nevertheless, the party emerged on top in Brandenburg and   Saxony, both states in the former Communist East Germany, which are   currently governed by one of the traditional, centrist parties. Both   states will elect new governments in September.

The   result is a political conundrum that has left both Ms. Merkel’s party   and its center-left partner unhappy with their roles in the centrist   government, known as the grand coalition. They agreed to the partnership   in [March 2018](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/world/europe/germany-spd-merkel.html?searchResultPosition=127&amp;module=inline),   though only after other governing options failed to materialize.   Neither party is well positioned to head into a snap general election,   vulnerable from the left by the Greens and from the right by Alternative   for Germany.

“The weakness of the   traditional parties of the center is simultaneously making the end of   the grand coalition more and less likely,” said Marcel Dirsus, a fellow   at the Institute for Security Policy at Kiel University. “More likely   because an increasing number of people in the parties believe that   things just keep getting worse over time. Less likely because ending the   grand coalition right now might mean things get a whole lot worse very   quickly.”

Ms.  Merkel remained  surprisingly absent from the discussions about the  European election  results. Her first comments came in the form of an  interview with [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2019/05/27/angela-merkel-germany-stand-up-to-anti-semitism-amanpour-sot-vpx.cnn)   that was released Tuesday, two days before she was to travel to the   United States to receive an honorary doctorate from Harvard University   and give the commencement speech to the class of 2019.

In the wide-ranging interview, she did not try to hide her differences with President Trump, whom she had [welcomed into office](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/world/europe/germany-merkel-trump-election.html?searchResultPosition=5&amp;module=inline)   with a blunt reminder of the “common values” of democracy and respect   for the dignity of others, saying, “He has his opinions, I have mine.”

The  best way to  fight Europe’s populists, the chancellor said in the CNN  interview, is  to show “why we are for democracy, why we try to bring  about solutions,  why we always have to put ourselves into the other  person’s shoes, why  we stand up against intolerance, why we show no  tolerance toward  violations of human rights.”

The   Greens’ strong performance, she conceded, poses “a challenge now” to  her  own party, which has struggled to reduce Germany’s use of coal and   continued to champion the combustion engine in the face of attempts by   Brussels to limit emissions.

Recent comments by Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, [who replaced Ms. Merkel as the Christian Democrats’ leader ](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/world/europe/germany-cdu-annegret-kramp-karrenbauer.html?searchResultPosition=3&amp;module=inline)last   year, have not helped, either. She has come under fire for comments   viewed as seeking to rein in the internet, after the fallout of [a video](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/25/world/europe/rezo-cdu-youtube-germany.html?searchResultPosition=2&amp;module=inline)   by a German YouTuber known as Rezo, who urged the country’s youth to   abandon the Christian Democrats because, he argued, their policies are   harmful to young people and will endanger their future.

Ms.   Kramp-Karrenbauer criticized the video in a news conference on Monday,   dismissing it as “spin” in the run-up to the election.

It   was the latest blunder for the conservative’s new leader, who has been   seen as the chancellor’s likely successor, but whose popularity has   dipped in recent months. Questions have been raised about who might   replace Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, Ms. Merkel’s chosen heir, if she were to   be forced out as party leader.

The   conservative party’s leaders are meeting behind closed doors on Sunday   and Monday, which has unleashed speculation in the German news media   over whether it could spell the end for Ms. Merkel’s chancellorship. She   has sought to suppress such speculation, insisting she plans to serve   out her term, but the poor election showing has only fueled the   uncertainty.

[Andrea Nahles](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/22/world/europe/germany-andrea-nahles-social-democrats.html?searchResultPosition=1&amp;module=inline),   the head of the Social Democrats, also faces mounting pressure to step   aside after her party suffered dual defeats, both in the European vote   and in losing control of the country’s smallest state, Bremen, for the   first time in more than seven decades, in an election held on Sunday.

It   was the latest failure for the center-left party, which has struggled   to define itself since it first entered into a coalition with Ms.   Merkel’s party in 2005. Since then, with the exception of four years   spent in the opposition, from 2013 to 2017, its political profile has   been weakened by compromises that led to diminished support.

Some   of the party’s more left-wing members believe that the only way for  the  party to win back voters would be to quit the coalition with the   conservatives.

But a call earlier this month by the leader of party’s youth wing, [Kevin Kühnert](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/world/europe/germany-kevin-kuhnert-spd.html?searchResultPosition=8&amp;module=inline),   to consider collectivizing large companies — he named the automaker  BMW  — and permitting people to own only the apartment in which they  live,  appeared to do little to attract voters last weekend, raising  questions  about whether leaving the governing coalition would help.

“They   can’t succeed in asking the right questions and raising the right   issues,” said Emanuel Richter, a professor of political science at   Aachen University, who thinks the Social Democrats will use their   position in government to move into election mode. “It’s not long until   2021.”",,/r/europe/comments/bu9wja/germanys_political_establishment_looks_fragile/ep8yz5q/,poclee,1559101914

69,"Right in the introduction:

&gt;The origin of gender systems is **certainly not a well understood phenomenon**. A reason lies in the heterogeneous nature of gender markers whose origin is known: sources for gender markers are numerous, and of different types (Aikhenvald 2004; see section 3.4). In addition, the history and the development of many gender systems can at best be reconstructed, but not directly observed. Lack of parallel developments clearly attested in different language families results in **reconstructions often remaining speculative.This is the case of the development of the PIE gender system.**

&gt;I'm not seeing that in part 3.3

&gt;Your own paper seems to disagree that it's far from accepted.

Reading it again, yes, you're right. My bad, and probably not the best paper to cite to drive my point.

Yes, all part of the Indo-European languages. Which we shouldn't use to judge all languages.

&gt;even Japanese and in this case also Chinese as pointed out

As pointed out in another post this was under contact with and influence of those very European languages very recently and mostly affecting the written language. You still haven't demonstrated at all how this is a global general rule when the only example are the Indo-European languages (and even there we may disagree on the evidence).

Nope you are wrong. There is no school of thought teaching that.

&gt; f crisis hits and your bonds are sold at 8% interest rate with 100% gdp debt ratio

8% ... France right now places 10 year bonds at 0.25%.

&gt; then you have to start spend 8% of your entire GDP ONLY to repay your interest - without decreasing your debt whatsoever.

No you dont. You never repay bonds in the sense of having less money afterwards. You pay bonds by selling new bonds. And thats no problem, France can do this for ever since is totally unrealistic that France cant outgrow 0.25% in the longrun. If France would not sell additional bonds, just offer new once to replace old its debt (relative to the GDP) would shrink.

""gender"" in Indo-European languages has a similar development. The origin of the now called ""masculine"" gender in Indo-European languages was originally an volitionary/animate noun class in the earliest stages of Proto-Indo European which most likely featured a very significant emphasis on volition as in whether an action is done consciousness with intent.Referents that could have such volition were their own class that eventually evolved into what is now called ""masculine"".

The ""feminine"" gender came _far_ later and in fact did not derive from the volitary but the involitary class or rather its plural form. Originally neuter in Indo-Euoprean languages did not decline for number as is common in many languages where only animate shows number and all inanimate nouns are mass nouns. The neuter plural has the same source as the feminine gender which is why in many old Indo-European languages they literally are. In Latin  in the nominative case neuter plural is always identical to feminine singular because it's just that; neuter plural re-analysed as singular.

So yeah in Indo-European languages this originally also did not exist. The origins of ""masculine"" are just conscious agents regardless of sex and feminine is a much later innovation.",,/r/europe/comments/btwdaj/scientific_vs_natural_ő/ep8k3xx/,je_kut_is_bourgeois,1559095993

181,"The 1848 Revolutions did not particularly directly affect Britain in the same way as it did in the rest of Europe. Britain was not without its worries during this period, however. For example, the Chartist Convention of 10 April 1848 in Kennington Common saw a massively increased police presence out of fears that it would erupt into an uprising. However, the Chartist movement's leadership had no intentions of staging an uprising, and after their petition of 6 million (or 1.9 million, as officially counted) failed, the movement's influence waned.

The 1848 Revolutions did have an effect on parts of the empire, however. For example, Malta and the Ionian Islands saw growing revolutionary sentiment, both from the influx of Italian refugees who fled after failed insurrections in the Austrian Empire, and in Cephalonia, a separatist group emerged, inspired by the 1820 Greek Revolution against the Ottoman Empire. Britain's response was to institute martial law over Cephalonia after a British official was killed by the separatists, while in Malta, a partially elected legislative council was introduced in order to quell tensions.

There were also tensions in the planter colonies such as Jamaica and Guyana over Robert Peel's repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 and the move towards free trade, and in settler colonies such as South Africa and New Zealand over the deportation of convicts to these colonies, but I'm admittedly not too sure how directly they can be linked to the 1848 Revolutions in particular.",Canada,/r/europe/comments/btuvrd/what_do_you_know_about_the_revolutions_of_1848/ep8l50z/,LexGonGiveItToYa,1559096376

Do you remember what happens when the conclave convenes in Rome to elect the next pope? There's the old saying: ""*Go in as a pope, come out as a cardinal.*""

There are several reasons for this: 

* Being the front-runner in a collegiate decision might be a testament to your status, power and prestige. Things which traditionally cause opposition, particularly if your power rests on the status quo.

* Front-runners who have been endorsed by major players beforehand might be perceived as mere extensions of their respective factions, prompting a stand-off with competing factions, resulting in the most powerful ones gridlocking each other. 

* For the reasons cited above, naming a front-runner might serve the purpose of making sure that he or she *doesn't* make it.

Nuclear power’s main issue is that the waste it does produce is pretty much permanent.  While that presents a problem, we can store it safely until we develop a solution.

1) losing a vote of confidence a simple majority can dismiss the PM and government. In a presidential system? No a majority can not remove the president. 

2) the PMs party can replace the PM for any reason. Example Thatcher or any Australian PM this week. In a presidential system? No a party can not replace the president under any circumstances. 

This is why PMs and their governments are replaced all of the time and why no US president has ever been impeached and convicted. 

If Canada did have a proper voting system like Germany it would also rely on coalition governments farther limiting the PM power. In a hypothetical situation where the Liberals needed the NDP to form a government the NDP could have pulled out and held Trudeau accountable. Compare the same situation but with President Trudeau. Could the NDP end his government? No it’s unlikely they would have the votes for a 2/3 vote to hold the president accountable.

318,"&gt; Financial services do, however.

No, they don't generally. Many require equivalence or some level of mutual recognition. London does far more with RoW than within the EU. 

&gt; No doubt about it. But there are two sides to every trade. The Continent would lose unrestricted access to the world's largest or second largest clearing and currency trading hub, and London in turn would lose unhindered access to capital and financing channels out of the richest market in the world.

London financial services is about 3% of UK GDP, Europe is about 15% fo that if I recall correctly, so 0.45% of GDP. Important but not essential. In addition to clearing nearly all euro denominated swaps, and handling more euros than the rest of the EU combined, London is also used for 80% of sovereign issuance. European business and governments depend completely on the immense financial infrastructure and resources in London. It is not something they can simply replace overnight. 

&gt; There's a reason why this arrangement has worked for decades: Because both sides have profited from it.

You won't get any argument from me. Now, why is the EU unwilling to ensure that this mutually beneficial relationship continues?

&gt; I can tell you why: Because the BoE has told Westminster to shut it.

Also reasons of this accident weren't provided to intended maintaners of RBMK plants. Who the fuck is gonna experiment on this afterall? But you know... Commies at their finest.

There are thorium and fusion powers currently developing. But they could have been common already if only energetics wasn't braking by peoples fear of meltdowns. And some shit happening feeds up that fear. For exmaple transformator fire on Rivne NPP in Ukraine. And there are many other leaks and accidents in the world.

364,"&gt;Sure initially, but we need to start somewhere. Our goal should be to expand outward with our humanity rather than inward. We began as small tribes, ended up forming villages which eventually turned into nations, the next step is expanding ourselves further to grow our collaboration. We humans won't evolve to our best form until we realize that it is in our best interest to work together.

That sounds a lot like ideology, instead of pragmatic self-interest.

&gt;This is if scarcity was actually an issue anymore, rather than an artificially induced phenomena due to how we've organized our systems. We humans literally dominate the entire world, we have access to every resource on every land and water available, we can breed animals and grow vegetables, we can practice sustainability to make resources last, soon we'll be able to grow food in labs. The issue isn't scarcity as much as it's greed and outdated institutions, at this point in time. 

Scarsity is definitely a real thing. Just take energy: we generate only so much, and while we could generate more, doing so would also pollute and increase climate change. 

&gt;We don't think the same way in Finland. 

No offense, but I kinda doubt it, because kin selection and favouritism are sorta hardwired in us by evolution. 

&gt;If we had a European Union military, you would also be able to trust them, because they have pledged to protect you.

512,"I agree that nuclear power is the best we have right now both in terms of overall pollution and efficiency. 

It really is a shame that there is such a stigma against nuclear power.

Let's take solar panels as they are a very clear example that can be easily understood.

To understand these issues, there is something you have to know first. The principal material used in the creation of solar panels is silicon. This is a material that is derived from quartz. The transformation process is very energy intensive and the furnace needed to heat the quartz emits tons of SO2 and CO2. The higher grade the silicon, the higher the efficiency. 

Nowadays, most panels are capable of converting between 15 to 20% of the light it receives into usable electricity. A nuclear plant will convert heat into electricity at a rate of 33 to 37% with headway toward generators capable of rates ranging from 40 to 45%. Furthermore, while the difference doesn't seem that big of a deal (even though it is), nuclear plants can produce electricity at pretty much full capacity at any time of the day every day until it runs out of fuel while solar panels will have varying degrees of efficiency depending on seasons or geographical location. What does that mean? It means that even if solar panels would suddenly start efficiently converting sun lights at an equal or superior rate to nuclear plants, you would still need to build comparatively more panels than power plants. 

As it is right now, if your nuclear plant produce 1000 MW of electricity and you want to build a solar array that match this production sustainably, you need an array capable of producing between 3300 and 5400MW (an estimated 70 to 120 km²). That's a lot of panels leading to tons of spaces taken and potential ecosystem destroyed. 

Of course, this is mitigated by installing panels on rooftops but you can only install so much before there is no more rooftops.

There are places in the world where solar panels make sense (deserts for examples) but wherever you need the maximum bang for your bucks in the smallest place possible while staying green, nuclear is the way to go.",,/r/europe/comments/btxb63/power_generation_by_source_in_eu_countries/ep655g1/,Enearde,1559064769

602,"Well but that's literally the only problem here - while solar panels for example are maybe greener when it comes to how they generate electricity, they're very bad in production:

""The process of producing solar PV cells (computer chips) is energy intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmental toxic chemicals""
(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel, section limitations)

So while yeah, they produce less waste later on it's still not very green to produce them.

Nuclear plants on the other hand are way greener:

""Nuclear power [...] has emission values comparable to or lower than renewable energy. A 2014 analysis of the carbon footprint literature by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that the embodied total life-cicle emission intensity of fission electricity has a median value of 12 g CO
2eq/kWh, which is the lowest out of all commercial baseload energy sources.""
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power, section environmental impact)

And if you look at the graph on that same page you'll see that the only source for energy that is more carbon efficient is wind energy, and it's very close.

So to return to your problem: yes, it is problematic to store nuclear waste. But there are ways to actually safely store these and right now countries try to build deep geological repositories that would safely store nuclear waste (see for example the Finnish Onkalo Spent Nuclear Fuel Repository) instead of just digging a hole and putting it close to the power plant, which would practically eliminate the issue of where to store that stuff.",Lower Saxony (Germany),/r/europe/comments/btxb63/power_generation_by_source_in_eu_countries/ep5l2nt/,Konju376,1559057487

606,"In very short term, you are correct, and mismanagement of forests (old growth and managed forests alike) is an issue that shouldn't be ignored.

However, in practice, I would still claim that biomass itself is, by definition, carbon neutral because the carbon in it comes from the atmosphere.

The whole definition of carbon neutral is that the carbon emissions are equal to the amount of carbon absorbed from the atmosphere. This is exactly what plants do: They take carbon from the atmosphere, and when they get eaten, burned, or rot away, that carbon is released back to the atmosphere.

The problems start if you continuously burn more biomass than you allow to replenish. This is the issue you were basically pointing at, and I agree: If you don't allow biomass to renew, then the process of burning biomass continuously removes carbon from the biosphere and introduces it into the atmosphere. This affects the carbon cycle between biosphere and the atmosphere.

Additional issues come with deforestation, because that's a process that prevents a forest from growing back into its former condition. However, most deforestation is *not* because of trees getting chopped down to be used as fuel, it's trees getting burned for land clearance and the subsequent soil erosion from overuse in farming.

*However*, the really important thing to take away here is that if all you do is burn trees, the amount of carbon in the biosphere and the atmosphere combined remains unchanged. This is not really as big of a problem as burning fossil fuels, because that messes up with the carbon cycle between the atmosphere and the litosphere (the ground).

Basically, by excavating and burning ancient fossilized plant remains, we're introducing massive amounts of extra carbon into the cycle between the biosphere and the atmosphere. This is the major issue that fossil fuels have. In comparison to this issue, it makes a whole lot of sense to designate biomass as carbon neutral because *considering the alternatives*, it sure as hell qualifies.

In short, I agree with you on the fact that biomass is not without its ecological issues, and it simply cannot be used to replace coal and other fossil fuels due to the simple need for energy we have, *but* when used sustainably and managed correctly, it can be a valuable *and* carbon neutral complement to our fuels.

In the end-game, we're still going to need fusion power plants just for doing carbon sequestration and/or converting atmospheric CO2 into synthetic hydrocarbon fuels, which would also be carbon neutral. That's really the only way to start undoing the change we've done to the atmospheric composition.",,/r/europe/comments/btk389/daily_share_of_britains_power_generated_by/ep5l6sz/,HerraTohtori,1559057534

They got 0% in Poland and Poland is building 0 reactors.

They are pushing for sane solutions unlike you. Your solution is **literally impossible** if you believe in Climate Change and accept the reality of building reactors.

932,"I can give you a helpful insight, seeing as I'm Portuguese and live in Romania.

Romanians protest. A lot. They love protesting, they love being involved in politics, even if it's a bit of a circus sometimes. But the trick is they care, everyone has a political alter ego and everyone wants basically *better*. In a way, every Romanian I know is a political vigilante. Except during the Summer, it's pretty funny that usually from June to October political activism takes a nosedive and without fail there's a protest in a fucking freezing Winter night in December to kick off the political season lmao.

Politics and issues are more grassroots than in Portugal, where nothing is reported as quite as straightforward as 'he's corrupt'. In Portuguese media I feel there's a flourish and nuance almost to alienate and estrange people to the issue and it drags on and on and on. It's also the nature of the corruption, most of the times corruption in Portugal boils down to white collar crime which makes it more confusing to follow while in Romania think of the uneducated, brute demagogues you'll find campaigning for, often, the Communist party and who are straightforward in their corruption by deviating funds in hiring their friend's or family company to supply the cheapest materials for construction and pocket the rest.

Just look at how Jose Socrates's arrest went and how he's seen, treated compared to Dragnea. Dragnea is demonized, entire TV sketches and segments devoted to parodying and celebrating the fact, people at work  were watching the live stream of him getting arrested and started celebrating when he was taken by the Police. Socrates went to a posh jail, is writing a posh book or something, and no one even cared or knows why other than 'ah he stole some money or something'. 

It's definitely a cultural difference, we Portuguese are mostly apathetic to our political life and we're much more 'forgiving' of white collar corruption while Romanians had to endure some hard shit not so long ago and even currently. Plus, while Portugal has a corruption problem, it doesn't begin to compare with Romania's corruption problem which stems from multiple factors: Recent dictatorship and a young democracy, plus the transition and baggage that comes with it, legacy politicians from the one-party system and their 2nd generation followers.",,/r/europe/comments/btpngo/romanians_having_a_spontaneous_party_after_liviu/ep49uwz/,giddycocks,1559036205

* Phasing out Nuclear power plants (will lead to energy shortage when the Sun is not shining)
* Phasing out Cole ( will lead to energy shortage when the Sun is not shining)
* Electric battery Production in Germany (Energy intensive Industry that is competing with Countrys like the US where energy prices are 1/3 of ours)
* No north stream 2 (just to make sure we can not fix the massive energy Problems that will be created by all the other Topics)

Here is the energy Consumption in Germany compared to Wind, Water and Solar production.

Water is already maxed out and the Sun is not shining at night so the only solution is to build wind turbines, but the construction of those is already problematic because we just dont have enough space. Looking at the Graph you will realize that we would need about 10x more wind power to plug the whole Fossile and Nuclear are leaving...

Humans are on the inside, essentially all the same, therefore there is no reason we could not extend our community and sense of identity further, and unite as Europeans 

But uniting as Europeans would still mean creating arestrictive ingroup based on arbitrary borders. And sure, there is no reason why we couldn't possibly do it, we just didn't just yet. If and when we do it, I'm gonna be a europan nationalist, but we're living in the real, not hypothetical world.

Also, being the same on the inside is irrelevant. Even if we were literally all clones, as long as scarsity was a thing it would be rational to compete, and the best strategy to do it is to form coalitions limited in size, so as to have both allies and competitors.

&gt;I'm also a little baffled by how you admit that you are aware that there is corruption in your own nation's government, yet trust them more only because they happen to have been born in the same bit of land as you.

—-

If by artificial you mean unlikely, then I agree. But this is a major decision for the country we’re talking about; any chance that this could happen is surely too high, simply because it’s unfair.

If the natural unfairness isn’t enough to deter you, the mere possibility that they could do this gives them power and makes them an elite class of voters matters more. This is because if someone has a proposition they want to put a referendum, trying to convince the majority of the population is a waste of time and effort unless you have the support of Northern Ireland (and Wales, in the other example). This means that Northern Irish voters are now more important and have their opinions valued more than other voters.

And the advantage of that is exactly what you describe in your second point: they get given projects and policies and infrastructure because the Northern Irish are now more important than everyone else, not because those projects/policies/infrastructure are better on their merits.

The FPÖ isn't extreme right. Just right‐wing.
&gt; With the exception of Jakob Kaiser none of these people discovered their resistance before the war went south.

This is literally just wrong. Stauffenberg began his plans before the turning point of the war. Goerdeler came to oppose the Nazis before the war even began. And the White Rose was also founded shortly *before* the war went south.
&gt; And as for ""begrudgingly supporting a law because you see no alternative"" - and the alternative was right there in the form of the SPD

That wasn't an alternative from the viewpoint of most conservatives back then. They had no way of knowing what would happen though.
&gt; let me quote Stauffenberg 1932:

It is widely known that Stauffenberg was a fervent Nazi supporter at first. I was referring to the parties in the German parliament that supported the law. Stauffenberg wasn't a member of parliament, but that was what we were talking about.
&gt; and even still 1944 he wrote ""wir verachten aber die Gleichheitslüge und fordern die Anerkennung der naturgegebenen Ränge.""

I refer you to what I said earlier.

1152,"&gt;No, the distinction I draw between the two is that large countries can absorb a larger pool of migrants

This is a matter of proportionality for all nations.

&gt;while simultaneously having a language that is attractive to learning, since a large amount of people use it. e.g. French and English in my previous example. Estonia doesn't have this benefit unfortunately.

Understandably, but this is the case for like 4/5 of European countries.

&gt;That's an assessment of the present. We are discussing the future. A future where Estonias native population is going to shrink dramatically in the next century, will need to either accept the population decline, or, use migration to grow the population. If you use migration, then you'll end up with a very large foreign born population that may or may not integrate well.

The situation literally cannot be worse than at the end of the Soviet occupation, when a large amount of very unwilling people of one ethnic group lived in very segregated areas of the country. Nowadays immigration works differently and a lot of that Russophone population is slowly integrating as well.

And the good status of the language is mostly a question of national independence and the proportion of people speaking the language within the nation, which has [risen starkly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Estonia#/media/File:Estonia._Knowledge_of_languages.png).

&gt;You very well could end up with the same situation but with whatever the home country is for most migrants.

Unlikely, given the very specific history of Russification in this country. They came en masse from one background with a political purpose and never intended to integrate. Nowadays people come in smaller numbers from a multitude of backgrounds and with far better intentions.

&gt;Even in Canada where we have a history of integrating people it isn't always a smooth process, idk how it's going to go for Estonia.

Not saying it's smooth - it really depends a lot on the amount of people, their social background and cultural proximity. For example the exiled Estonian upper and middle classes integrated very quickly in Canada during the Cold War.

&gt;As your country becomes wealthier, generally the population growth rate will decline unless bolstered with immigration.

Meh, I don't buy into this rather short-term trend that richer countries have too few children. Not in heaps of course as that is a sign of a little developed country, but nowadays the amount of children strongly depends on people being intelligent enough to be cautious about causing problems for themselves with more children. But with more incentives with even richer societies in the future, I can't see why fertility rates would continue to fall.

&gt;but if there is such a large Russian population then that isn't going to make integration smooth for newcomers, as learning only Russian will always be an option in the parts of the country that're predominately Russian.

It's not like the poor Northeastern Estonia or poorer Tallinn suburbs are getting much new immigrants.. :)

&gt;your country almost certainly will not have a positive domestic population growth rate anytime soon.

In the coming decades? Most likely not. But I don't really like making such predictions for longer time periods. Three decades is way too short of a time in human history.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/bt5nuy/baltic_territorial_changes_between_interwar_and/ep3gs3e/,k6lvatu,1559022735

You bet your hat the NVA will spin not being in the federal government to their advantage next elections. Ignoring them now and putting them in opposition (and ignoring a lot of Flemish voters in the process) will only benefit them AND VB. VB doesn't even have to lift a finger.  

Remember the 2004 elections where VB got nearly 25% of all Flemish votes? The NVA was in a cartel back then with the CD&amp;V. The main reason they got knocked back the election after was because NVA had split off from CD&amp;V by that point and presented itself as a social acceptable alternative for VB.

1228,"&gt;they want their own voice in the world

Ask any country outside of the large economies within the EU how their voices are being heard? Remember when Russian rebels in Ukraine shot down that Dutch airliner and yet German is gearing up to have a Russian pipeline shoved down their throats despite the protests of Eastern European nations. Ask the Eastern European countries or Austria how their voice was heard when Merkel decided to bring 2+ million refugees into Europe, in-fact ask Greece or Italy about their voices being heard when they wanted help in dealing with the Influx of refugees. What about Italy’s voice being ignored and being pressured into economic reforms and fined when not implementing it. 

We could go on and on about how smaller countries within the EU have had their voices and concerns ignored as it doesn’t go along with the ideology or beliefs of the larger economies or the EU leaders. So let’s not pretend that the EU magically gifts every small nation this big voice, the EU is more equivalent to smaller nations getting to piggy back onto bigger nations and hoping that every now and then policy will go in their favor. 

The EU may however grant you a voice within the EU but it will not grant you a larger voice in the world compared to

Needs in steel and coal are skyrocketing, mining pushes people to move out of their villages and lands for big companies and bigger towns. Because they're told they'd find jobs, money, and a better future in industry than at farm.

However these workers are still very poor and sometimes starving. It's a wild liberalism era. Big companies are not yet regulated. The people feel they don't have their share of this progress.  

1848 is essentially a big social uprising against the way the poorests are treated, and where new anticapitalists ideas born during the 1789 French revolution or the 1820 British are growing up. Like Saint-Simon's Socialism or Robert Owen's Communism, which will reach France, as well.

In France, after decades of chaos and austerity because of the debts, reparations, political and economical bloodshed let by Napoleon and 2 failed parliamentary monarchies : the nephew Louis Napoleon Bonaparte put the hand on the the power with populist ideas and will slowly overtake the whole power and poorly use it. But as economy was now based on growth and capitalism, it will later turn into a nationalist-capitalist competition for natural resources, and the feeling that nations have to predate each other to survive.  

In the end 1848 have been a turning point in Europe. Industrialization was here, but not yet profiting to the people who broke their chains here and there for more populism and nationalism.

During the era Stalin was alive and both Stalinist parties and post-Stalinist USSR was a thing, communists who were anti-Stalinists and strictly out of the USSR camp (including anti-Moscow faction) used the sickle and hammer as their political symbol. The symbol is about Leninist traditon, nothing less, northing more.

Sure, it might make Eastern Europeans to recall something specific. I wouldn't go and suggest said factions to adapt the symbol in any country where Soviet Russia had a domination. Yet, it doesn't mean the symbol is directly associated with Stalinism or the post-Stalin USSR even.

&gt; Besides, it's not like modern day spoiled Gauche Caviar kids have anything in common with the tough, peasant, Russians who overthrew the Tsar and fought in multiple wars.

I'm sure not all communists are radical chics. I'm also not sure whom you're applying the term gauche caviar, but I'm sure many would label Lenin, Kropotkin or Engels such as well. The symbol wasn't about who overthrown whom either, but symbolising alliance between the urban workers and the peasantry. It's not about if someone is a worker or a peasant or not, but the ideology itself.

&gt; Might as well use a new symbol, the proletariat of the past decades certainly wouldn't be saying things like ""Gay space communism"" (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_under_communism#Soviet_Union)

USSR kind of communism isn't the only variant of the communist ideology, nor the persecution of gays were a thing from the very start of the Soviets, but it was the Soviets who have liberalised things before Stalin in those issues.

Hungary didn’t take in millions of Ukrainians - Hungary has a current rate of foreigners of 1.65% and an overall population of 9.7 million people, which, btw,  is one of the lowest worldwide and yet they’re throwing a tantrum like a small child every time someone crosses the border. It’s also interesting that you seem to like people from the former Soviet Union - I guess you weren’t alive when you saw what they did to Hungary during the soviet-occupation.

You got a lot of facts twisted my friend - better get your facts straight before you enter in conversations like these. The British PM stepped down - it wasn’t the people who ousted her. Brexit happened because of the massive influence of cheap Eastern European labor and not because of “Middle Eastern” people. Not all darker skinned people are from the Middle East either - as a matter of fact, not a lot of Middle Easterners live in the UK as it’s not particularly easy to go to the UK with it being an island and what not. Due to the nature of the British Common Wealth, it was relatively easy for people from the Indian subcontinent and some African and Caribbean states to obtain British citizenship and to move to England. That has nothing to do with the EU or Brexit and has long been over. The EU freedom of movement treaties only involve EU citizens and Pakistan is not an EU country. 

Anyway, I consider this conversation to be over from my part - perhaps you should inform yourself and get out of your Nazi-thinking and condescending child-like behavior. That might improve your personal living situation. Perhaps you’ll find out that life is much better once you’ve stopped blaming everyone else for your shortcomings.

1421,"&gt; We are responding to one of them right now:

I can't see anywhere in the passage you've quoted where it says *only* nuclear. 

&gt;And then you go on in your comment to advocate against renewables and for nuclear, the exact thing you just said you don't know anyone who would suggest it.

No, I am against wind and solar, not renewables. Hydro is renewable, and I'm in favour of that. Bio gasses from waste are renewable, and it's a lot better to burn them than vent them. 

The problem with wind and solar is their systemic intermittency. When it's dark solar doesn't work. Solar provides very little output on many winter days. Wind generation is low across very large areas at the same time.

Wind averages 30 - 40% of maximum production, solar about 15%. That means, unless we significantly over build (which is too expensive), some flexible generation has to produce at least as much as wind, and far more than solar. 

For any particular amount of capacity, nuclear will produce much lower emissions, at roughly the same cost, than wind or solar. 

&gt;Literally just showed that PV+storage is cheaper than nuclear.

How much storage? It's no good having 1, 2, 4 or even 8 hours of storage when wind and solar can underproduce for weeks at a time. Wind/solar and a few hours storage still need gas backup. Is wind, storage and gas cheaper than nuclear? Of course not, and the emissions are much higher.

&gt;Yet you think that ""most countries"" can't do the cheaper thing

They can if they are prepared to accept frequent blackouts. But developed countries won't accept that. 

&gt;but can do the thing that is more expensive and politically unviable in a lot of places?

I think it would be a lot more politically acceptable if the environmental movement campaigned for nuclear, rather than telling people comforting lies about wind/solar and storage. Nuclear power, catastrophic warming or frequent blackouts. Pick one. 

&gt;You are arguing for the status quo.

No, I am arguing for the only way we can prevent catastrophic warming. Wind and solar cannot reduce emissions enough. They need a breakthrough in energy storage that's simply not on the horizon at the moment. Do you think Germany is building Nordstream 2 for fun? Do you think all the LNG terminals being built have no purpose? Wind and solar are intermittent. The population in the developed world won't accept intermittent electricity. Government and industry are planning to use gas to make up for the intermittency of wind and solar.

What happened is that Georgia Biomass got dinged because they upped their pellet production without updating their title V permit... the state then made them install an RCO in order to get an updated permit. This situation caused other states to review the permits of the pellet plants in their states, which lead to the TCEQ to do what they did.

If you fly it in public you will get confronted by authorities and if they see it's not for a movie or something you will be in a pickle how to explain it. Hence the word ""propaguje"" (close to English ""promotes""). To be deemed as promoting a thing with a swastika would also have to have a Nazi propaganda. Than you could get a fine, jail time or it confiscated. Also Finnish or Hindu swastikas and other non Nazi ones are not covered by this law. The German is way stricter I think, so Nazi era say H0 train models, which are usually made in Germany/Austria and for that market have an eagle on a circle not a swastika or books on Nazi history have no swastika or SS runes on them. In Poland this is not a thing. Books on WWII history have prominent swastikas or SS runes on covers. Like these:

Even though the U.S. is about as dominant as it gets for an aerospace power, it’s important to remember we exercise analytical humility in looking at why other countries may choose a different design, based on the context of how they see air defense and their requirements. The fighter will allow Russia to attain qualitative air superiority over a 4th generation air force, and work with its own integrated air defense to counter penetrating stealth aircraft. It is a reflection of the Russian philosophical approach to the tactical aviation component of its Aerospace Forces (VKS), intended to support the strategic air defense mission first, and engage in standoff strike as part of offensive aerospace operations.

&amp;#x200B;

The percentages I list are how many seats they hold in the national council based on a vote 3 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Welcome to Game of Government, the story so far:  


Episode 1: 

Last week German media released a video of our vice chancellor (FPO, 27.8%) trying to collude with the niece (fake, actor) of a Russian oligarch to buy one of the more popular newspapers and secretly push their party. Also in the video: finger guns, vodka redbull and bragging about illegal party funds.

As a result the vice chancellor stepped down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Episode 2: 

Then the Minister of the interior (FPO) was forced to step down by the chancellor (OVP, 33%) and the president (not affiliated with a party, but Green-ish. The Greens hold 0 seats), but the FPO threatened that all their ministers would step down as well. They did. The president replaced them with ""experts"".

The chancellor broke the coalition between his party and FPO. 

&amp;#x200B;

Episode 3: Afterwards talks about an antitrust vote against the chancellor/OVP. Meanwhile the SPO (28.4%, they had their worst election results ever this EU election (23.5%)) said they wouldn't support the antitrust vote against the chancellor/OVP, instead bringing forth their own antitrust accusations against the whole government (which they're in opposition of). So basically OVP AND the 4 ""experts"" who have been in office for less than a week.

  
This succeeded and now the president needs to appoint a new chancellor who will form a new government. I'll leave you on that cliffhanger. 

&amp;#x200B;

1642,"Your argument is odd. The current disaster, nor a similar one, cannot be reached by usage of nuclear power.

Society banks on availability of know how and spare manpower for everything, from agriculture, to metallurgy, to transport, to war, for *every* generation.

Your complaints about the lifespan of the waste I imagine would invalidate any proposed long term solution to nuclear waste, no? Do you believe in any currently proposed solution? Do you believe in any currently used long term solution to *carbon* waste? Is it silly to say we should have a solution to a contentious issue already whilst complaining about shortsightedness?

A bigger problem offloaded to a smaller problem sounds quite nice. It appears the normal argument is we can put less time, less effort and less money into renewables so would probably suit your argument better than saying we can't take option B over A because B still has problems. The only time it gets mucky is if you talk of countries like say, Germany, and their decision to go from option Nuclear to option Coal instead of going straight to option Renewable.

We know a lot about nuclear, I doubt anyone considers it green unless it's in a cartoon. The last user wasn't arguing if it was green but better, which is what your coal versus wood implies is a logical route of replacement?

It might be best not to latch onto the 200 years bit, whilst you're speaking what I assume is the truth, it does make you sound like you're advocating not swapping from carbon until renewables can fully replace it.

Your heart isn't misplaced and nuclear isn't infallible, it's just you can use better arguments, especially if you see the flaws in mine above, which there are. :P",,/r/europe/comments/btk389/daily_share_of_britains_power_generated_by/ep180i7/,CosmicScientist,1558985798

1789,"&gt;The best defence against oppression is the empathy borne out of a sense of community and shared identity, which for the most part exist within the nation-states but not at the european level. In short, I trust more my own country's politicians/police/judges/military, than other countries' ones.

A sense of community and shared identity is indeed a good attribute to society, but the idea that the only way to accomplish this is by the use of arbitrary map borders and highly restrictive ""in-group"" ""out-group"" type of thinking is misguided. Humans are on the inside, essentially all the same, therefore there is no reason we could not extend our community and sense of identity further, and unite as Europeans with a common desire to strive and preserve our well-being, and ensure that powerful and potentially predatory nations don't take us a prey and pit us against each other. 

I'm also a little baffled by how you admit that you are aware that there is corruption in your own nation's government, yet trust them more only because they happen to have been born in the same bit of land as you. 

In our political environment, strength is necessary for the protection of our way of life. There are some very powerful players operating in the world right now, a strong Union is helping us preserve ourselves rather than fall victim to those who are more powerful. 

Fundamentally, the EU is there to protect the greater interests and freedoms of Europe, against nations that otherwise would see us as loosely connected smaller countries that can be manipulated and exploited.",,/r/europe/comments/bst9l5/united_we_stand_divided_we_fall_go_vote/ep0qik4/,AlienAle,1558979009

1874,"&gt; Defence. Whether we go to war, and our young men and women are asked to die in some far-flung land for foreign policy goals. Whether we choose to spend literally BILLIONS on a weapons system we can't use and would never want to, to be based 10 miles from our largest city, that the majority of Scots feel is immoral and by the way, might be leaking nuclear waste a bit...

What about the proposed EU army? Have you though what about that will ultimately be used for? As the EU becomes more integrated, it is more determined to make it's own geopolitical and foreign policy. If a pacifist agenda is what motivates you, Scotland would be better off as fully independent, not part of the EU.

This point is also largely subjective, lots of Scots are proud of their shared military heritage within the UK and, if forced to pick a side, would rather remain allied with the rest of Britain. 

&gt; Fiscal Policy. How much tax you pay (albeit some very limited tax-powers for the Scottish Parliament, but nothing near the ones needed for serious economic management), how much tax corporations pay - and if they actually get forced to pay it. How much debt the country incurs on our collective behalf. What currency we use. What the rates of interest are for borrowers and savers.

Lol, do you actually think raising corporation tax would have a meaningful impact on government revenues in Scotland? The UK has been lowered corp tax for most of the last decade and revenues from this source have continued to go up. There is evidence for this all over the place, the Laffer curve is real. 

You should also be aware that one of the key eurofederalist goals is to implement complete tax harmonization across the EU, if that happened Scotlands hands would be completely tied in this regard. 

&gt; Welfare. How much money those at the very bottom get. How much support those who are disabled and can't work can get. How our elderly are treated. What we can do about the 1 in 4 Scottish children growing up in severe poverty and how to get them out of that.

I like that you bring this up. Scotland's overall budget deficit is 8% of GDP, an absolutely enormous figure that is usually only seen in advanced economies during recessionary periods. Whilst it's true that devolved spending is balanced (because it has to be) the rest of the UK continues to pump significantly more funds into Scotland than it is able to generate itself). Now, if Scotland goes independent it will faced with a choice: do we simply cut across the board to balance the budget (which would be austerity on steroids and an arguably more significant economic contraction than in 2008/2009), or do issue shedloads of debt to keep government spending up and thereby fill in the hole left by Westminster (risking a ballooning national debt and spiraling credit rating. 

Immigration. As a country we have a declining population yet because of right-wing agendas from parties scotland hasn't voted fringe a majority since literally the 1950's, we have policies that are turning people away, deporting qualified, economically active contributing members of society out of Scotland because of rules designed in London. Our friends, our neighbours, our kin; the primary school teacher, a nurse, a doctor, the guy at the garage who does my wheels for me, Scots one and all, getting deported because of administrative failures in the home office, punitive cost based around cost-of-living in central London...more nonsense every day both asinine and Orwellian in nature, and something we have zero influence on; our MPs have voted against it and get ignored..and unlike Europe, these major policy decisions don't have a veto. We just get to lump it.

In the EU Scotland would have no control of immigration coming from the EU26, no whatsoever. I get that immigration is required to address the demographic crisis, rUK has the same problem and Westminster could, in theory, address it for the whole country, including Scotland, in a managed way.  With your proposed solution there is no tap you can turn off. When the next sovereign debt crisis hits and Greece melts down completely, as the rest of the periphery are pushed to the brink of default (potentially beyond), tens of millions of unemployed EU citizens will move to the countries where there are jobs. Every time there is any sort of crisis on continental europe this will happen. And Scotland will be powerless to stop it.

I fully appreciate the value and necessity of immigration, but you still need to explain why this would be better in the EU than in either the UK or an independent Scotland that wasn't in the EU. Unlimited immigration is not a universal panacea and can be as much of a problem as a solution, conceding ultimate control of is not a move in the direct of self-determination.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/btiqgp/the_stark_contrast_between_scotland_and/ep07jan/,MyFavouriteAxe,1558971644

Personally I think we probably need one more generation of nukes to replace those which are currently almost end of life. At the same time we need to be building out wind and solar and working on storage and other renewables which might have a place.

While phasing out coal is good, it's mostly been switched to natural gas. Great in terms of particulates air pollution and slightly more efficient, but still a hell of a lot of carbon being emitted.

1909,"&gt; A child is shielded from most of the impacts of government policy (admittedly not education or health) due to them being cared for by their parents. An independent adult however is far more affected by the outcome of an election, vis a vis taxes, pensions, benefits, immigration, law etc.

Wait what? Sorry I think you got something wrong here.

As a child you are directly affected with the education system, because it's under direct impact of your government.

Child money is under direct impact from your government.

Pensions are also often more affecting for childs. Ff parents can't pay it, well it sucks much more for families as for independent adults. And with how old adults get these days, most independent adults, can often still go home to their parents (and people get much older before leaving home these days).

Older peoples have much less contact with immigrated persons. Children meet them the most, in school or on the street.

2) People that are 80+ don't pay taxes anymore. They actually need to be paid so no reason why &gt;18 years old should not be allowed to vote.

There are even safety features like national vetoes and stronger representation built into the EU system in favour of smaller nations.

Meanwhile, England has 85% of the UK population and 89% of the economy. The fact that repeated governments have focused almost exclusively on London doesn't help either.

In the worst cases, where the vote is more fragmented, the portion of voters who actually are represented is much less than that, sometimes only a bit more than a third.

Honestly I don't even think most people care about their vote being public today as they did in the past but an open ledger would allow for anyone to recount the votes. 

I think we are probably in a middle stage of making this feasable from where we need to be but can't happen until the older generation passes unfortunately. 

I know Estonia tried to push that they were on the cutting edge when it came to block chain and digital IDs but honestly it still has a long way to go. They also screwed alot of businesses and investors that initially believed them and relocated there during the ico token boom.

theres more to politics than money, sometimes you can be in favor of something that hurts yourself financially because you consider it outweighed that aspect of it.

principles matters a lot, and being principally against a collection of a lot of power in a small place is just fine, being against giving part of your own democratic power away to a central government in brussels is fine too, as is being against the slow erosion of the european countries into becoming just memberstate of a mega-country (eu).

2241,"A few things:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Pro-independence leaders spoken got on a broken car and spoke to protesters from there. These leaders were later arrested.

&amp;#x200B;

Plenty of people got onto those cars, including a lot of journalists who used it as a vantage point for documentation. The Jordis went up there to address the masses with permission from the guardia civil to do so to try to appease the crowds and get them to go back home.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the guardia civil left rifles alone inside the cars and didn't try to get them back in what to me is a clear violation of protocol. The rifles weren't touched by the protesters and no one got hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;There was some violence when people tried to stop the police from seizing ballot boxes, and the police responded.

&amp;#x200B;

Violence was pretty much completely police-sided. It was not a protesters attack ==&gt; police respond situation, at my polling station they arrived and were charging within minutes without any kind of provocation, shooting rubber bullets afterwards while they fell back. The reaction of the people was only of panic and flight, I will never forget that day.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://spanishpolice.github.io/](https://spanishpolice.github.io/)

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Other fled Spain before they could be arrested (Puigdemont and others).

&amp;#x200B;

Puigdemont left the country BEFORE an arrest warrant could be produced against him. This is an important distinction as he left Spain a free man, and has always been at the disposition of the authorities of the countries he's been in. When the european arrest warrant was produced he presented himself to the belgian authorities who decided to not extradite him. This is not the behavior of someone that is fleeing from justice.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The arrested leaders were provisionally imprisoned, charged with sedition and rebellion.

&amp;#x200B;

And they've been imprisoned for almost 2 years now without having been charged. The Jordis weren't even politicians back then

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Puigdemont was arrested in Belgium and Germany. However, Belgian and German legislations don't have crimes similar to the Spanish rebellion, so he couldn't be extradited, and he was released. Now, he is free, but cannot enter Spain or he would be arrested.

&amp;#x200B;

German legislation has the same crime on the books (high treason it's called), this was not due to it not being on the books there but because of the tribunal in Schleswig-Holstein deeming the rebellion crime to not have occurred because the level of violence required for it did not happen. This is actually the same situation as here in spain, the rebellion charges also require violence that did not happen, the difference is that spain is pushing rebellion nevertheless and germany saw that it couldn't be applied. AS germany wouldn't extradite him for rebellion, spain removed the european arrest warrant.

&amp;#x200B;

In the case of Belgium, it was rejected due to irregularities in the EAW presented by Llarena and thrown out when they decided to take back the EAW.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Junqueras and other imprisoned leaders were candidates to the general elections last month. They got seats. The Supreme Court allowed them to be proclaimed deputies, but not to work as them. This means they are deputies but can't go to the Congress. They were allowed to go to the Congress in the first day, though.

&amp;#x200B;

So the situation is this, they are allowed to run for office and to be sworn in, but at the moment they become parliamentaries they are suspended (remember they haven't been charged yet and have their political rights intact), leaving their voters (1 million) without the representation they voted for AND changing the absolute majority in the parliament from 176 seats to 174, which causes PSOE to now be able to get majority without having to talk with the independentist parties. Very fair.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;However, there's a catch for Puigdemont. **In order to be a MEP, elected politicians must go to the Congress in Madrid**. So Junqueras will be allowed by the Supreme Court, but Puigdemont cannot go to Madrid because he would be arrested.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where it gets interesting. Does one become a MEP because of the swearing-in or does one become a MEP through the votes? Can Spain just arrest a MEP that was voted by the citizens before he is sworn in and block their representation in the european parliament? Rembember that MEPs do NOT represent the countries but their voters, and that Puigdemont is not fleeing from justice as there is no EAW against him. And Junqueras is still only in preventive jail without having been charged, having all his political rights intact so he should be allowed to be a MEP or spain would be meddling with the results of the vote.

&amp;#x200B;

2301,"&gt;Sure, but rarely the stated intentions of the original revolutionaries.

It depends on the revolution, really. Some of them (like the Spanish Revolution) turned out to be very close to what the original revolutionaries wanted until they were forcibly dismantled by outside influences.

&gt;Reformism created the European social security with incremental steps. Even if you consider it insufficient, it would simply be unthinkable without.

Did it? I always thought that the Haymarket affair was what played the biggest role in the establishment of the 8-hour work day. It is why it's the base for the International Workers' Day. The best improvements to their condition that the working class movement has ever achieved have come through strikes and protests. It hasn't come by voting in reformist parties that ignore their base to shill out to big companies (like social democratic parties have been doing for the past 10-20 years).

&gt;So the revolution the discontented people support is a far right one. Doesn't sound wonderful.

Those are the results of neoliberal economic policies. It's one of the reasons why it's so important to combat those policies. They make people detest anything that purports to be left-wing (since neoliberal economic policies are what the right-wing desires so they see no difference between soc-dem and lib-con parties) and thus can only channel their anger towards the far-right.

&gt;Why do you think that countries would be more accepting of refugees without the EU?

Because a big part of the argument that the far-right uses is ""EU is telling us to do that so that makes it bad"". Without the EU as a boogeyman, they wouldn't be able to use that argument.

&gt;I'd say that Europe is pretty supportive of refugees, anyway. There are more UN-recognized refugees elsewhere, but those often don't get support from the countries they are in.

I live in Greece. I've seen the way that the coast guard treats immigrants up close. I've seen how they forcibly enforce the Schengen agreement by not letting anyone past Greek borders and by locking them in prison-like hot spots. Don't tell me that Europe is supportive of refugees. The EU as a central authority doesn't care about them and only uses them to earn political points against those they dislike and the individual member states are, in a lot of cases, hostile to refugees.

&gt;And what makes you think that the people support a revolution to throw open the doors?

I've seen a lot more support for open borders by common people all around Europe than I've seen it from the governments of their respective nation-states or the EU.

&gt;Even if you would have a revolution to achieve that, why do you think you won't lose control of the revolution to the extreme right? Once you have established that it's okay to seize power by force, why would the extreme right not try their chance?

Because I don't believe that people are stupid. When you make it clear to them that the far-right is only trying to take advantage of their understandable grievances and show them a different way to achieve a world where their existence isn't threatened by constant poverty then they aren't going to keep supporting the far-right.

&gt;How would abolishing the EU make that better?

Well, for one it would bring down the Schengen Zone so southern countries wouldn't be forced to detain refugees to hot spots.

&gt;See, that's the absolute claim of ideological purity again. For us, or against us. You'll never achieve anything that way. You're not even scary to the establishment.

The fact is that most changes in favor of the working class have historically come by revolutions, insurrections, protests and strikes. Now, I may personally not be able to achieve anything, that's true. But I'll try since that's the way that has been proved to be more successful.

Will you try? Frankly, based on this discussion I don't even think that you have any interest in improving the conditions of the working class.",,/r/europe/comments/bs6wsg/dutch_ep_exit_poll/eoy6y8n/,Nuntius_Mortis,1558935152

This is blatantly false. 75 of their members of their parliamentary faction voted for, 225 voted against, 4 abstained and 5 never voted on the issue - that's literally 3/4 of the parliamentary faction against, a clear majority.

2327,"&gt;I know Hungary hasn’t been doing overly well economically, but from my perspective, this has primarily been Fidesz’ fault.

I'm a staunch left voter, but that's just about as far from the truth as it possibly could be. Despite all their slogans paraded around about being the party protecting the interests of the 'little people', Fidesz is clearly pro-business when shit comes to pass. The so-called 'slave law' is just an extreme display of that, many more concessions and favorable legislations fly under the radar of international news outlets that make Hungary an enticing investment location for foreign investors. 

Life had become noticeably more convenient for Hunor, the Average Hungarian since Fidesz came to power. Now, of course, a lot of that has little to do with who was in power during that time, and a lot more with the general worldwide economic upturn, but therein lies Fidesz's (or Orbán's) genius in exerting strategic command over mass communication. If you were to ask the people of Hungary, the global financial crisis would barely get a passing mention and almost all growth in the 2010s would be attributed to the economic genius to Viktor, First of His Name. Most locals have no idea the exact same has happened to every single Eastern EU member state and that we rank mid-range when you consider all of them. The Fidesz loyalists firmly believe the govt had performed a once-in-a-generation economic wonder matched by none. 

It's also dishonest to frame the anti-Soros campaign as something fundamentally anti-Semitic at its core. It surely panders to the generic Eastern European animosity toward the conspiratorial concept of 'the Jews', but I don't believe Soros was targeted primarily because of his religion. It was much more due to his unambiguous political stances that could be easily spinned around the 'conniving Jew' theme to tie in with the 'globalists are coming to destroy your way of life' narrative. But the same was applied to other EU actors with no Jewish background, so I think his commitment to globalism and open society is what made him primarily a target.",https://i.imgur.com/Ci4cGRn.png,/r/europe/comments/bt5e00/eu_parliament_elections_hub_the_final_day_4/eoy7c17/,vernazza,1558935512

2472,"&gt; About your example, I have to say that blocked streets and police showing in force in Madrid is hardly newsworthy.

You are distorting what I write. I wrote there were cops EVERYWHERE. Meaning there was more cops than I have seen in my entire life and I have lived in the US. When there are several police helicopters in the air at the same time it means something newsworthy is in fact going on, particularly when the biggest news scoop in Cordoba is about a construction site or something of that magnitude.

&gt; So I am curious. If you told a person from, for example, Marseille, that you saw closed streets in Paris, plus riot police and helicopters, etc... but that you don't know what happened and that nothing has been shown in the news, would they be really concerned about itand try to get extra information, or would they say something along the lines of : ""Well, if it's not in the news then probably nothing particularly important happened in the end."" 

They would not just brush it off as being unimportant because it happened in another part of the country.

Nationalism - at least the healthy style - is just putting your people and your nation first; it does not involve harming those who do not belong to your nation -- as long as they're not harming it of course.

Think of it as a family. Your nation is your extended family of people who share an ethnic/linguistic/historic heritage with you. You'll want to protect them and put their interests first, that's to be expected. But that does not mean you want to harm/disrespect other 'families', given that they don't harm yours.

Expansionism, jingoism, and imperialism are a different matter entirely - those DO look for imposing your interests on others and making them answer to you. For better or worse, the strongest nations in any given period end up becoming expansionist whether they realize it or not.

For the Social Democrats, the bleedings hasn't stopped; in fact, it has accelerated.

I don't really think the comparison is fitting. The idea is that you respect the office because it is the representative of the citizens. This isn't unique to the US at all. The Élysée has far more trappings of monarchy than does the White House and Macron gets quite bent out of shape when he doesn't feel he is treated with the respect that the President of the Republic deserves (BFM interview, teenager saying Manu, etc). I've spent years living in both countries and I really don't think the US and France are all that different in regards to this aspect of political culture.

&gt; the USA will lay, in this context, near the UK, not near France.

I hear this a lot but I honestly think it's a misconception in a lot of ways. The culture of government in the US is very similar to that in France, even if the ideologies of their major parties differ.

This would primarily be because in practical terms, he is. I think your interpretation of the US system is coming at things backwards.

2610,"It's quite simple: with a right wing party in government, things haven't changed that much. Justice is still a mess in Belgium, migration issues haven't declined, and what's been most historically successful in tightening migration is making the parties scares of the far right. 

A second reason can just be found in the main parties themselves. For instance the centrist CD&amp;V in Heusden Zolder. They, as many mainstream parties, looked for minority candidates to please the minority voters and one of them was Yasin Gul. Yasin was found to appear in Turkish ultra nationalist Grey Wolf videos and was subsequently evicted from the party, but he could not be removed from the electoral list anymore. Today, Yasin Gul was CD&amp;V's most popular politician in Heusden Zolder.

The Kosovo issue is very complicated and it isn't a clean cut. There were always the question who oppressed whom and in what period of time, so there is neverending game of oneupping. Kosovo never was an entity by it's own, maybe some smaller autonomy in Ottoman empire and later in second Yugoslavia. They were part of Great Albania shortly, but that ended with the end of WWII, there is no Kosovo people, Kosovars, Kosovians, only Albanians, Serbs, Montenegrins, muslims of Slavic origin that call themselves Bosniaks,not the Bosnian ones, today even tho they don't have Bosnian origins and are native to the land they live in and other numerous, but ever shrinking minorities now.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/bt5nuy/baltic_territorial_changes_between_interwar_and/eouqadh/,Broj_Krun,1558877593

3130,"Reactors don’t ‘blow up’, they melt down. A nuclear reactor is not a nuclear warhead.

Also the idea that areas become completely uninhabitable is complete hyperbole. Chernobyl is by far the worst nuclear incident to have occurred, yet very few people died directly from the event - around 28 iirc. The radioactive isotopes which get spread far from the site tend to be  the lighter ones, mainly iodine and caesium. The iodine is of minor concern, as it has a half life of 8 days (again iirc) and can be counteracted by taking iodine tablets which will prevent the radioactive isotope from being absorbed in the thyroid. Thyroid cancer is a particular concern for children, as it is more likely to occur as the thyroid grows. However it also has a 99% survival rate. In short, the actual effects from radiation exposure due to chernobyl are relatively minor. The main issue of concern is radionuclides entering the food chain and being ingested by humans before they decay to safe levels. This can be handled by cutting the food supply imminently as was the case in Fukushima, however this was not possible in the largely rural and agrarian economy surrounding Chernobyl.

The current consensus from health professionals is that the overreaction and psychological damage from the panic surrounding the few case studies (eg Chernobyl and Fukushima) far outweighs the effects of the radiation from the dispersal of short lived radionuclides.

The following link provides a good overview of the health effects following Chernobyl.

That's nonsense. You go from saying ""there's no such thing as baseload"" to saying ""we're developing tech to get rid of baseload.""

... I agree, that tech alleviates the need for baseload, but consider this. Electric cars are a pure add on the power grid, even though they (obviously) store power, they are also require additional capacity. Smart meters will take ages to implement (has any jurisdiction even mandated new homes have them?). Heat pump tariffs are taking ages to get going (and I would know, I work for a company that is currently exploiting the German 25.2 cent geothermal heat pump feed in tariff.). Home storage is only viable in significant meaningful quantities with smart meters. Every new house needs a battery by LAW. 

So with all that in mind, baseload is still extremely necessary, I'm afraid.

3229,"Its replacement should have purely economic goals such as removing trade barriers and aligning regulations to reduce cost of doing business. It should be more like a framework that would allow countries to cherry pick (if for instance France and Spain only want a borderless trade corridor with each other, they should be allowed to without having to accept the other terms). It should also come with an immediate leave clause that can be invoked at will when a country feels its national interests are no longer served by being a member.

As a result, countries would only accept deals that benefit them and would be able to cancel them if they no longer do. This would ensure there are only upsides and no downsides.

Also, just like the US constitution specifically limits the power of the federal government, there would be a ""constitution"" countries sign when entering the system that limits its power.

One benefit of this is that countries that are hostile to economic activity will have little to offer and will not find many good deals. This should encourage them to take the necessary measures to improve their economy.

&gt;I told you already, folklore, literature, arts.

You told, but you didn't really provide any evidence for it.

&gt;Religion, nowadays, yes quite different from previous generations

Like since the Reformation?

&gt;apart that nothing else, besides, do you think that changes culture that much?

Jesus, Estonia was a Finnic nation controlled by Lutheran Baltic Germans, while Lithuania was a Baltic nation, Catholic and either independent or in a common state with Poland. What similarities in culture do you claim there even are??

&gt;I just point out, that those are quite insignificant considering the span of history and it's implications on our cultures through centuries.

And you seem to be oblivious to the obvious differences in the main aspects that define cultures...

&gt;I understand, young blood boils and is always right and correct

I am not right and correct because I am young (I have no idea how old you are), but because I am educated and my statements are based on crude facts.

&gt;My best advice would be, go back to learning English, or Estonian I don't know where you lack the text understanding, only in English or in general.

You are actually left with blaming my poor English skills? And you blatantly disregard the obvious major differences in history, language, religion and culture and you still blame me of bad reading comprehension??

&gt;Jannipaev is part of Estonian culture, right? As I understand it is one of the most important parts of culture, correct?

*Jaanipäev*, yes. As is common throughout Northern Europe.

&gt;Books, damn on those I probably wouldn't find that wouldn't be based on the same motives or eniviroment., ofcourse with some divergences.

OK, you seriously need to start backing up your claims.

&gt;Man, honestly, there isn't much I would be able to find that is very different from Lithuania, or something that could be called not similar.

Besides history, language, religion and culture? Sure, besides these aspects, Estonia and Lithuania are very similar.

3333,"&gt;Saying that the one thing that will stop dividing us is either stopping integration, scaling back integration or getting rid of the EU altogether as opposed to deepen the bonds between EU members is silly. That's like saying nationalism brings countries closer together.

No you got it wrong, *pretending like nationalism and differences in culture does not exist* is what's gonna split the EU up. You're stuck in a bubble. People do not want more power to the EU. It's already against most country's constitutions. Power should come from the people, but now it doesn't it comes from Brussels, from politicians who people in any individual country hold no control over. 

If you think people in Poland, Hungary, Chech Republic, Slovakia and so on are going to accept being forced to recieve immigrants, **you are mistaken**. They will leave, just like the UK did. There is a reason why Poland's population is less than 1% muslim, they do not want muslims there. Neither do the rest of the eastern members. 

Likewise, the free movement and high costs is what caused the UK to leave. What happens when UK leaves? ""Let's increase the costs of all member states to cover what the UK was paying"" is the solution, instead of scaling back the budget. 

And in the process, more and more legislative power ends up in Brussels. People do not like this development. We are not going to become a new USA. The cultures are are far too different for that.

Several words however – especially ones relating to the sea and seafaring – were borrowed and adapted into Low German/Dutch through contact with Norsemen.

In a democracy, it's every citizens damn responsibility to listen to what a politician says, and critically think ""Can this really be true? Can we have all these things with such a small budget?"".

And now Germany stepped in to save you. They helped you, but in order to get your budget fit for your economy again you needed to make changes and cutbacks. Then you get upset? What the hell do you expect, seriously? 

The baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) went through a period of severe savings in the 90's and early 2000's.

3437,"Denmark already had strong climare regulations. Emissions are down year after year as a result. The Country is a model for wind power and most of its coal plants have been converted to burn trash and biofuels.

The emissions issue Denmark needs to address is their agricultural production. They're an exporter of pork, milk, and beef - an industry that produces a majority of Denmark's emissions - methane and nitrogen, which are wayyyyy more problematic for the atmosphere than carbon from fuels. Simplified version is each green house gas is made of tiny molecules. These molecules float up into the atmosphere and ""hold"" heat from the sun. Usually the sun's heat comes in to the earth, then most of it actually leaves earth through various ways. Some of the heat stays because earth has an atmosphere made of gases that hold heat in (this is why the earth is warm but the moon is cold - gases that hold heat in an atmosphere. So, when we dummies add morree green house gases, the atmosphere gets ""thicker"". Like an added layer of blankets. Some molecules hold heat better that others. Carbon dioxide molecules hold heat for only about 100 years. But methane and nitrogen hold heat for 100s of years. So, Denmark produces a shitttt ton of methane and nitrogen from its ag sector.

Is Denmark willing to tell farmers to stop producing pigs and cows?? Are the protesters aware of what they are asking? Do they know what the costs will be to society? They haven't a clue. And that's the problem. Those costs are why politicians and the voting public dgaf about climate. Higher prices+Less jobs=no political support.

Protesters need to be aware of the objections and be more engaging about the economic effects of changing a system. How does one tell a farmer to stop growing pigs and give up their business? How does a government tell a farmer to stop exporting milk?

That's a tremendous amount of supplies and means of production that were just captured without contest; perhaps not enough for Czechoslovakia to defend itself, but even the use or destruction by bombing of a substantial fraction of it could have caused Germans to become strapped for supplies substantially early on, especially since at the very start they did not have their forces nearly so built up as later on. Destruction begets partisans which results in more Nazi-aligned forces needing to stay in the area to keep people suppressed. This is in the realm of alternate history, but anything that puts an end to the war sooner saves a mind-boggling number of victims.

I see Germans all the time in this sub, thinking how NS2 isn't such a big deal, but back then when Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for non-binding international agreements, the risks also seemed minimal. Russia wasn't going to attack Ukraine right? Then 20 years later they did exactly that.

Russia shows exactly zero signs that it would intend to change its foreign policy behaviour. And the more multilateral the world becomes, the less incentive will Russia have to change its conduct.

Species die off and desertification are secondary factors as they are caused primarily by emissions at scale in all regions, but that dosent diminish what Bolsonaro is doing to the Amazon.

3531,"&gt; Hmm... no. The invasion was merely a Pyramid Phyrric Victory. It probably made people vastly underestimate the vast Satanic powers the fascist Axis of Evil could weild.

""Pyrrhic Victory"" is the term, and I'm not sure it qualifies. Sure, there were 200,000+ Italian casualties, but it bought Mussolini the height of his popularity in Italy and corresponding latitude in his ability to rule, including to invade other European countries. The League of Nations who condemned it and their backers were shown to be utterly toothless or worse, trying to come to an arrangement to end the war in the aggressor's favor by throwing Ethiopia under the bus (see the [Hoare-Leval Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare%E2%80%93Laval_Pact)). Rather than demonstrating weakness for Italy, it demonstrated the weakness of the League of Nations and its supporters; while they wrote complaints, Italy gained territory, war experience, fervor for fascism and other nations such as Germany got some ideas that maybe they could start pushing the envelope a little further without fearing retribution.

&gt; Not sure you mean by China though.

In 1931, the Japanese military set and detonated explosives near a stretch of railroad controlled by Japanese interests in China, damaging a small stretch off to one side of the rail. With its honor so attacked by what it claimed to be the Chinese, Japan invaded China's northeastern provinces in force without warning. China appealed to the League of Nations for assistance, and so it set up a [commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytton_Report) that found that Japan did not act in self-defense nor to liberate the territory it made a puppet state on. In light of this the League of Nations demanded the withdrawal of Japanese troops. The Japanese delegate smiled, left the League, and no further assistance was tendered to China; it simmered down for a spell until the Japanese decided to bite off more in 1937, when the Second Sino-Japanese War began.",Mississippi,/r/europe/comments/bsvgpf/wehrmacht_entering_prague_1939/eotvcdp/,sparkling_uranium,1558849648

The worry is that the institutional inertia is too strong (generating more laws, improving position of parties/blocks and parliament generally vis a vis Commission and Council of Ministers) and is moving in a direction opposite from the perceptions in the nations. (Who is cheering on the successes of the EU? Whoever they are it feels they are struggling against the easier narrative of ""Our problems are the fault of the EU"".)

This issue around perceptions goes back to the Habermasian issue of where is the european discourse arena? Where is that common sphere of dialogue across the EU where these perceptions can be informed and developed? As long as there is no real common sphere of discourse these issues can remain. Coupled with the treaty-democracy tension (which I also don't see going away anytime soon), it's not easy to see any kind of resolution to these fundamental challenges.

3678,"&gt;And in general, I think they are right, if they do things properly.

With the current multicultural model, it's difficult to do. You either do what Brazil did and mix everyone up to the point where race doesn't matter and everyone is a Brazilian or you end up with people divided along racial lines like the US, all vying for political power and their slice of the pie.

I see skilled immigration as a benefit as long as it isn't at the expense of the natives and as long as they don't make up too substantial of a population. The world isn't quite ready for freely mixing to this extent like many left leaning people want. A lot more development will need to be done till we reach that stage where the playing field is equal and all major cultures are similar enough for that to happen.

Issue is, it's hard to talk about these topics without someone co-opting it.

Also, I agree that VOX is not ""mainstream conservative"" and certainly reactionary but it doesn't really get into ethno-nationalist territory. Abascal hovers at the edge of the white/Euro far right movement but never really commits to it.

3756,"That's not a great argument on your part though. The EU has democratic elements, but EU voters have far less control or say over how the EU works than UK voters do over how the UK works. MEP's are less accountable than MP's in the UK (and less transparent, but that's a different issue..).  Yes the UK has the Lords, but if you look at the role and powers of the Lords it becomes hard to call that aspect of Parliament undemocratic either (or if you do, you suddenly have problems with any un-elected body in any country that has any input on, or ability to delay legislation).

In the EU, most of the power rests with the member states, the EP isn't where power rests, or where the political direction is set, it has some limited powers to hold the commission to account, and it can effectively approve legislation, to a certain extent. If it were the government of a country it'd be seen as fairly undemocratic. But it's not, its competencies are limited and its powers are only those that are granted by member states. In that context it may be far less democratic than it's members, but then it has a more limited role too.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/bsyeal/eu_citizens_denied_vote_in_european_elections_to/eot6kcw/,-ah,1558835853

3910,"&gt; It's the responses we got from the CDU that made them look really, really terrible.
&gt; First they announced a counter-video by Philipp Amthor, their ""youth star"" - that video never happened.

""Youth""? That guy looks like 47. In fact he is just 27. That's just sad. 

&gt; Then their secretary general issues a response on Twitter, but fucks it up and sends 7 individual tweets instead of using a thread for it.
&gt; Then the CDU had to delete basically half of their youtube account, because of copyright violations.
&gt; And we had more brilliant Tweets by major CDU politicians such as talking about how terrible people streaming the original video must have been for the climate, due to the energy usage.
&gt; ...did I mention already that their ""reply"" to the YouTube critique, probably to gain some points back with all these young people on the internet, was publishing a goddamn 11 page long .pdf?

No wonder they want to censor the internet as much as possible. It's probably very scary for them.

3919,"&gt; Everyone is installing solar and wind because of the massive subsidies. 

Except areas where there are 0 subsidies and they continue to be used because they're still the cheapest source of new power.

&gt; Noone wants to build new nuclear PP because of regulatory risks (why invest billions in a reactor with a lifespan of 60 years if in 10 years the government might ban it?)

Ah yes, the chinese government is clearly worried they might ban nuclear. Do you listen to yourself? No one wants to build nuclear because every time anyone builds nuclear it goes overbudget and is cost delayed. Why? **Because the honest estimates of construction cost never get accepted. That means they have to LIE to try to convince governments ""THIS TIME IT'S DIFFERENT"". Unsurprisingly, it never is.**

&gt;\- All data start in 2009 (cherry picking much?)

This is not cherry picking. What would be the utility of looking earlier than 2009? Looking at the cost for building nuclear power in the 1970s, with shittier regulations and chernobyl-esque plants? I'm sure it would be cheaper to build reactors without containment, I'm also sure that's a retarded idea.

&gt;\- Solar vs Peaking Gas (p9): Comparing with a peaking power plant? What?

Yes, because you can build out solar, and then replace the use of a gas peaker by just allowing the solar to flow freely effectively (rarely). It's an alternative to having gas peakers, to just overbuild solar capacity and turn it on as needed. So even if it is only turned on intermittently, it is starting to become cheaper to just have solar that is unused the vast majority of the time, and only intermittently ""turned on"" vs a gas peaker plant, for day time use.

&gt;Capital cost (p10): Nuclear 6500$ to 12250$ per kW? Their own report from 2014 gave 5385 to 8200, and historically a nuclear PP was as low as 2000€ per kW (roughly 2 billions € for 1000MW)

Sure, and historically nuclear was viable. Renewables also used to be expensive, nuclear used to be a viable technology, But you know what? Things change. Nuclear got more expensive (your own link confirms this) and renewables got cheaper (by every study ever conducted).

  
**Let's take a look at some recent nuclear power plants.**

**Hinkley (UK)**: 31.15 billion for 2.66 GW(estimate, still rising): **11,710 USD per KW (so far). Start time? 2016. Estimated end time? 2027. 11 years.**

**Flamanville (France)**: 12.75 billion for 1.6GW (estimate, still rising): **7,970 USD per KW (so far). Start time? 2007. Estimated end time? 2020. 13 years.**

**Vogtle expansion (US)**: 27 billion for 2.2GW (estimate, still rising) **12,272 USD per KW. Start time? 2009. Estimated end time? 2022. 13 years.**

Alright, nice. So we can see that lazard is pretty spot on, **maybe a bit low on the estimates for construction costs, and definitely for construction time, which was just 5 years 9 months. I wonder how the estimated cost would shift if you plugged a real world 11 (or 13) years in?**

&gt;\- page 16, 55% capacity factor for wind? seriously? That's cherry picking the best case scenario, even offshore wind farm have a typical capacity factor of 40%, same thing for PV.

38% to 55% seems about right. Capacity keeps getting higher. The average for a new on-shore plant in the US in 2016 was 42%, and this is a few years later. The best case scenario for on-shore wind is a bit over 60% in nicaragua. The range is 29-56 USD per MWH (before subsidies). At the high end (38% capacity factor) it is still around 1/3 as much as nuclear. Similarly, their offshore estimates for wind are, if anything, conservative. Offshore wind farms are hitting 60-65% now.   [https://www.ge.com/renewableenergy/wind-energy/offshore-wind/haliade-x-offshore-turbine](https://www.ge.com/renewableenergy/wind-energy/offshore-wind/haliade-x-offshore-turbine). 55% (the highest capacity factor they assume) is, if anything, low.

&gt; Also I don't see the life expectancy of the power plants taken into account.  

That's primarily because you do a bad job of reading. They list ""facility life"" for every tech they compare. You couldn't do a levelized cost analysis without that (obviously). However they are pretty generous with their assumption that a nuclear power plant would be operational for 40 years. After all, many existing nuclear power plants are going out of business because their MARGINAL cost cannot compete with NEW renewable plants in 2019. In 8-13 years (when a new nuclear power plant actually starts producing power) renewables will have fallen \~50%.

&gt;And thank you but I'm familiar with Lazard, that doesn't mean I trust their ""estimates""

3939,"&gt; I'd say that revolutions are much better at bringing results than reformism.

Sure, but rarely the stated intentions of the original revolutionaries. 

&gt;What has reformism achieved lately on the EU level? 

Reformism created the European social security with incremental steps. Even if you consider it insufficient, it would simply be *unthinkable* without.

&gt; It has only managed to push working people to the far-right because ""reformist"" social democratic parties have abandoned their ties with the working class and are instead pushing for further liberalization of the economy.

So the revolution the discontented people support is a far right one. Doesn't sound wonderful.

&gt;Yes, because the EU is so much about dissolving borders. That's exactly why it has instituted the Schengen Zone 

Schengen is about reducing border friction, yes. Without Schengen, there would be much less movement for ordinary people, but still the same for capital fo course. Can it be better? Obviously.

&gt;and it has turned itself into a fortress.

Why do you think that countries would be more accepting of refugees without the EU?

I'd say that Europe is pretty supportive of refugees, anyway. There are more *UN-recognized* refugees elsewhere, but those often don't get support from the countries they are in.

And what makes you think that the people support a revolution to throw open the doors? Even if you would have a revolution to achieve that, why do you think you won't lose control of the revolution to the extreme right? Once you have established that it's okay to seize power by force, why would the extreme right not try their chance?

&gt;Yes, there is free movement of people between EU countries. What about the ones outside of the EU, though? What about the migrants that are dying in the Mediterranean trying to get in?

How would abolishing the EU make that better?

&gt;If one's goal is to dissolve borders then the EU isn't the way to do it. It isn't truly internationalist in its goals. The driving goal is profit and nothing else.

Not only that. He also claimed that the bottom 50% of Germans are getting poorer, which is clearly wrong. The statistics show that the share of the overall income earned by the bottom 50% went down. Additionally the statistic refers to gross wages, which is misleading, because the state does quite some bit of redistribution through taxation. 

His relative poverty statistic is misleading as well, because it is outdated, has a misleading axes interval and doesn't factor in migration, which according to the left-wing Böckler-Stiftung skews the number. 

He also manipulated a manipulated a graph showing the share of inherited wealth over time by cutting off the years, which showed a decline and by editing out the compared countries (they show that Germany isn't special in this regard).

This is all what they do. They *claim*. They hide behind this claim.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Idk where this woke idea that the far-right that claims to protect European civilization is literally the same as islamism comes from, but it makes no sense.   


They don't want to protect shit. Islam is just an excuse for them. I don't trust them. They don't do shit in good faith.  
They are anti-EU nationalists, against European integration, against liberal democracy, against the check and balances, against international institutions that enforce and guarantee liberal democracy and check and balances (that is why they are against the EU), they want dismantle the institutions of the liberal democracy and create their own Russia's everywhere. That is oikophobic as fuck. And far-right.   
See Bannon, see Orban, see Strache selling Austria to Russia. [Also read this](http://hungarianspectrum.org/2019/05/18/viktor-orban-the-role-model-for-would-be-dictators-the-case-of-heinz-christian-strache/).  


The promise / the pitch of the anti-EU nationalists is really similar to the one of the Muslim preacher at Mosque that are radicalizing. Come young men we will offer you a conservative paradise from the past.   
Videos of this [guy are far-right/islamic as fuck](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Black_Pigeon_Speaks). In one of them he claimed that women destroy civilization.  He also hides behind this ""saving European civilization"" meme.  Felix Lace is a far-right conservative nationalist (ehtno-nationalist event).   


Also see [this](https://youtu.be/2Cylm92TKNY).  


It is not literally the same, but a different/modified version of the same base far right and conservative value system. The value system of the anti-EU far-right conservative nationalism and far-right Muslims stems from the very same source.  
Everything that is wrong with Islam stems from the far right and conservative value system of the people who created it.  
The far right and conservative beliefs of the creators of Islam have been embedded into that religion, Islam is a vehicle for their enforcement and longevity.  This is also the case with other religions. Religious hypocrisy saves the world and becoming liberal / less far-right saves the world.  


The far-right are far-right anti-EU anti-liberal democracy people, not social conservatives.  


&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Are third world extremely conservative christians or hindus also far-right in this case?  

Yes.  
(although, I don't know much about religions in India).  
If they also want to do away with the separation of state and church and base the laws of the country on religion they are also nationalists. For example, in Poland the far right anti-EU nationalists say that being a Polish person equals being a catholic (how is this different than religion=identity / political religion in islam?).",European Union,/r/europe/comments/bswmhr/german_youtubers_dont_vote_cdu_or_spd_or_afd/eosbuc8/,Braindance_in_VR,1558820759

4127,"If you're giving back to your nation for giving to you, firstly that assumes a born-and-raised mentality of nationalism which excludes those who arrived in your country perhaps as adults, having never availed of your country's education and healthcare systems, who nevertheless wants to protect and secure the country. And if it's about future benefits- the immigrant's children might avail of the system- then I get to claim future benefits in protecting you as well: If I help you now, you will be able to help me later, if I should need it. And if there's a chance that altruism ends up being useful to you, or your nation, then surely you have to take the view that the fate of the French is important to Sweden?

Unless we take the ""shared values"" point as the basis for immigrant nationalism, in which case, you could make the case that, as members of the EU, or UN, or some international organisation that protects shared values, you actually do have a kinship with the likes of the French.

It would also mean that you would have no obligation to protect a part of Sweden that the majority in want to abolish some of those shared values. Or to make it clearer, I would have the obligation to protect a French person who believes in equality since that is my shared value, but not a Northern Irish person who does not.

Even setting all this aside, your own Government disagrees. And so do most Governments.

No? Come on dude. I didn't say Hitler's opponents were the Nazis. *Our* opponents are the Nazis. You were using Hitler's anti-free-speech laws as an example of why we shouldn't have them, but you accidentally made the opposite argument.

You showed us that free speech laws can be used to effectively limit political opposition. The problem with Hitler was his views, not the free speech laws themselves. Your example shows us that free speech laws could be used to limit Nazi ideology instead. That would be a good thing because Nazis suck.

&gt;Jesus fuck this is beyond a chore. You straight up can't even begin to parlay with this kind of ignorance.

Learn to read.

&gt;The Nazis restricted speech precisely because they DON'T have freedom of speech guaranteed to them.

No, the Nazis restricted freedom of speech for non-Nazis because the opponents of the Nazis were calling for an end to their oppressive régime. The left wing and the right wing are ultimately irreconcilable, so Hitler had to ban opposition. Unfortunately for everybody else, Hitler was on the Wrong Side of History, so his free speech laws were bad.

I'm not sure about that. I saw it on wiki (I'm assuming you saw it there too)

&gt; There, in Corfu, since 1809 he started learning [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language). 

but this sentence doesn't have a source and I can't find it anywhere else. And as you can see from this paragraph that the greek-arbanitic dictionary that Botsaris wrote is being mentioned this sentence can't be correct:

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markos\_Botsaris#The\_Greek%E2%80%93Arbanitic\_dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markos_Botsaris#The_Greek%E2%80%93Arbanitic_dictionary) 

&gt;  The original manuscript of the dictionary is at the National Library in Paris (Supplément Grec 251). **Botsaris titled his dictionary “*****Lexicon of the simple Romaic and Arbanitic language*****”** (Λεξικόν της Ρωμαϊκοις και Αρβανητηκής Απλής (*sic*)). The Greek terms are in columns on the left of the pages, not in alphabetical order, and the Albanian words on the right, written in Greek letters. Apart from single words, the dictionary includes complexes of words or short phrases. The Greek entries are in total 1701 and the Albanian 1494.   
On the first page there is a hand-written notice by Pouqueville: “*Ce lexique est écrit de la main de Marc Botzari à Corfou* ***1809*** *devant moi*.” This manuscript, which includes also a kind of Greek–Albanian self-teaching method with dialogues written by Ioannes Vilaras and a French-Albanian glossary by Pouqueville, was donated by the latter to the Library in 1819. **The dictionary was dictated to the young M. Botsaris by his father Kitsos (1754–1813), his uncle Notis (1759–1841) and his father-in-law Christakis Kalogerou from** [**Preveza**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preveza)**. Titos Yochalas, a Greek historian who studied and edited the manuscript, noticing that some Greek words are translated into Albanian in more than one way, believes that M. Botsaris was writing the Greek words and the elders were translating into Albanian.** As many of the entries seem unlikely to be useful either for the Suliots or the Albanians of that time and circumstances, Yochalas believes that the dictionary was composed after Pouqueville’s initiative, possibly as a source for a future French-Albanian dictionary. **He also observes that the Albanian phrases are syntaxed as if were Greek, concluding that either the mother tongue of the authors was the Greek or the Greek language had a very strong influence on the Albanian, if the latter was possibly spoken in Souli (Yochalas, p. 53). The Albanian idiom of the dictionary belongs to the Tosk dialect of south Albanian and retains many archaic elements, found also in the dialect spoken by the Greco-Albanian communities of South Italy and Sicily. In the Albanian entries there are many loans from Greek** (approx. 510), as well as from Turkish (approx. 190) and Italian (21).[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markos_Botsaris#cite_note-21)",Greece,/r/europe/comments/bst1bi/markos_botsaris_jeanléon_gérôme_1874/eorfu58/,noimira57,1558806339

Half answered by saying it's a portrayal problem:

&gt;The pipeline is just one example of how unfair it is to portray the Eastern European EU countries as worse Europeans.

The other half of the answer is missing - any class of member is not brought up by the article. The only word of the title to exist in the title reappears in ""Second World War""

* the article isn't related to its headline

* decides eastern Europe = Poland

* states a long list of Poland's physical and political qualities, to say they shouldn't be looked down upon because *they exist for a reason*

* decides Germany is not morally superior due to its citizens having an opinion poll for foreign policy to not defend Poland from a third party war

This means that there was enough german-speaking scientists who worked and publish in germanic states that they were able to ""force"" entire foreign community into using German.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;**Well only if you don't consider the Scientific progress made in India and the middle east. And even then I doubt that, so if you could provide a source that would be great.**

Middle East and India didn't progress too much. Their culture, religion was far-more science-unfriendly and more importantly their geography didn't threw at them need to find solutions which Europeans had to find in order to survive in much more harsh climate of Europe. This is why Europe conquered the world and we designed most of the important discoveries.

Neither India or Middle East participated in scientific progress after late bronze age or early middle ages.

&gt;**Are you saying we should all go back to hating each other?**

No. General hate of the past, was the result of uninformed population. Without modern means of communications people in state X didn't understand that those other people across the border are struggling with the same shitty life decisions and are not different than their neighbors.

Do not correlate hate with decentralization. This is common misconception against pro-unitary-state people.

Most Europeans live in liberal democracies that are committed to resolving their differences by all-night meetings in Brussels, not unilateral action, let alone armed force. This European Union may be short on mystique, on emotional appeal, but it is not lacking that entirely. The heart can lift to see European flags fluttering beside national ones, and certainly to the strains of the European anthem, Beethoven’s setting of the Ode to Joy.

&gt; For everyone who is a citizen of an EU member state, this is a continent where you can wake up on a Friday morning, decide to take a budget airline flight to the other end of the continent, meet someone you like, settle down to study, work and live there, all the time enjoying the rights of a European citizen in one and the same legal, economic and political community.

4365,"Well, if you put enough mass in one spot, you can get a *big* black hole forming.  But that'd require about 1.4 solar masses.  I guess the Sun's handy, and that's 1 solar mass.  But that's still short.

Setting aside the practical issues of getting enough juice to move that mass, even dropping the planets and the rest of the solar system into the Sun just isn't enough for a big black hole.

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General_Astronomy/The_Solar_System

&gt; The Sun makes up 99.8% of the mass of the Solar System.

The Alpha Centauri system is the closest other source of mass, and that'd contain enough:

&gt; Alpha Centauri A has 1.1 times the mass and 1.519 times the luminosity of the Sun, while Alpha Centauri B is smaller and cooler, at 0.907 times the Sun's mass and 0.445 times its luminosity.[16]

But unfortunately, the fastest we currently are able to travel with known physics is the speed of light.

&gt; Alpha Centauri (Latinized from α Centauri, abbreviated Alpha Cen or α Cen) is the closest star system and closest planetary system to the Solar System at 4.37 light-years (1.34 pc) from the Sun.

The BMW commentary was not the SPD, it was Kevin Kühnert. People on the outside may make fun of the statement, but a lot of people on the inside are really pissed off and rightfully so: His idiotic comment isn't his problem, but our problem because it hurts the whole party, as you just demonstrated, but there is little to no support for ideas like this. It also completely overshadows positive comments he made, like demands for a higher minimum wage and issues with temporary work, both of which are of concern to the people who may sympathize with the Yellow Vest movement in France. We haven't done enough for the working class lately, but a lot of the focus had to be on immigration and refugees, because it was the greatest challenge we were currently facing and I understand that people feel like they are being neglected and left out in favor for people who've just arrived here, but we've weathered that storm and you'll find that the focus will indeed slowly shift back on the working class and the socially disadvantaged. Personally I'm also a little upset that the Diesel scandal mainly rubbed off on Germany, because it weren't only German manufacturers who did shade things. It has been dealt with in any case, how ever good or poorly, but a bigger problem right now is that German car manufacturers sleep through the electric revolution. Part of fixing this, could indeed be sanctioning of Diesel vehicles, but everyone kinda gotten the wrong end of the issue, because this change has to begin with the manufacturer, rather than trying to make Diesel (or regular petrol) unattractive to the consumer or even telling them that they can't use those cars anymore. This is indeed a fault with our own politics, how ever, the the Green Party for example would do just the same, just worse and also on the back of the consumer. I talked to some FDP candidates who had some interesting approaches, but that would essentially mean to encourage the industry to make the switch with greater subsidies, but this would be so unpopular with the voters, I don't even want to start to imagine. And yes, it's really frustrating how slow our infrastructure is growing, especially concerning the internet in rural areas. You'll find that no matter what problem you have, people in politics will share your concerns, but when ever you do something, someone will say ""but what about XYZ"". I wish all of this were a little easier.

Well, this was a little long, but in short: Yes errors were made and more will be made in the future, it's unavoidable no matter who's in charge, but there are many people who try their best. It would be great if more people would start participating in politics themselves. Not every local association is great, but there are also work groups and what not.

Boris Johnson has adult children, was born into money, and has never had to honestly ""live"" off of his income as an MP or any other job he has had.

If Boris Johnson, with all adult children, millions of pounds in assets, and years worth of prior high income cannot support himself and organise his own finances within 140k a year for a 6 year stint as PM where everything under the sun will be provided for him, is he someone we want making financial decisions of the entire country?",,/r/europe/comments/bshjpt/theresa_may_resigning_2019/eoq55hu/,ReginaldIII,1558785209

So, you're strip mining A LOT of coal, meaning you also remove A LOT of other materials to get to said coal. You need to put it somewhere, so you pile it up. Bełchatów mine stripped so much earth and rock they made a mountain... well, OK: a hill. And on that hill a ski slope was made, around 800m in length and 180m in relative height from bottom to top. PGE, company that owns the power plant, invested in proper ski lifts, snowmaking machines, snowcat plus two restaurants on top and bottom so you can get authentic mountain experience out of it.

4631,"Also, Switzerland (and Canada) have described themselves as confederations for historical reasons even after they had converted to federations.  Canada eventually stopped.  Switzerland still does it:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland

&gt; Switzerland, officially the Swiss **Confederation**, is a sovereign state situated in the confluence of western, central, and southern Europe.[9][note 4] It is a **federal** republic composed of 26 cantons, with federal authorities seated in Bern.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland_as_a_federal_state

&gt; The rise of Switzerland as a federal state began on 12 September 1848, with the creation of a federal constitution in response to a 27-day civil war in Switzerland, the Sonderbundskrieg.

-

&gt;  The constitution represents the first time that the Swiss were governed by a strong central government instead of being simply a collection of independent cantons bound by treaties.

https://www.diffen.com/difference/Confederation_vs_Federation

&gt; By definition the difference between a confederation and a federation is that the membership of the member states in a confederation is voluntary, while the membership in a federation is not.
&gt;
&gt;Sometimes confederation is erroneously used in the place of federation. Some nations which started out as confederations retained the word in their titles after officially becoming federations, such as Switzerland. The United States of America was a confederation before it became a federation with the ratification of the current U.S. constitution in 1788.

4655,"To me this just sounds like a cop-out so other countries don't have to feel sorry about the things they have done. ""W-well, Britain was larger!"" - right, but (for instance) the areas of the Americas that Spain colonised and genocided were densely populated and held the largest cities in the world at the time, far more people were killed by the Spanish Empire than the British Empire over both of their durations.

I'd also say the number of genocides plays a big role in how evil a regime was. So for instance the Ottoman Empire's genocide and long-lasting slavery in East Africa and Eastern Europe was  despicable (of course, the British Empire also caused untold misery through harsh ruling and ignoring famines/creating a famine in Bengal). 

Finally I'd say the decolonisation of nations matters. Britain has decolonised all of the major places it mercilessly snatched from the previous inhabitants. Somewhere like Russia (for example) spread eastwards by wiping out peoples who resisted and transplanting Russian speakers there to crush their independence movements (sort of like how Scottish settlers in Ulster were intended to weaken their independence) and to this day the nation of Russia retains all of those places, committing countless genocides during its expansion. And yet Britain is still more evil, even though the empire is long dead?

""Britain/England"" just shows the ignorance here. Cornish, Scottish, Welsh and Anglo-Irish nobility were just as imperialist as the English - the UK wasn't just some ""English"" project of domination where the other British nationalities served as cannon fodder (the majority of soldiers forced into the navy+army on pain of death were English). Actually the nobilities in each of these countries were keen on expanding their wealth and power, Scotland for example had joined the UK because it was bankrupt after trying to colonise Panama. 

History isn't as black and white as you would believe. I'm a staunch believer in exposing the horrors of imperialism but simply using ""ThEy CoNqUeReD mOsT lAnD"" as the metric for evil committed is nonsensical.

4677,"Second-class members? In Eastern Europe's EU states, clocks tick differently in many ways than in the western old EU states. Among other things, more nationalism is the order of the day. But that is understandable for many reasons and should not be a reason to look down on Eastern Europeans in general, writes Florian Kellermann in his commentary. European elections The hurdles for European campaigners Croatia before the European elections Little enthusiasm, but many problems In February, the governments of Germany and France reached a compromise. It was about the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline, which will bring gas from Russia directly to Germany. The result: the pipeline can be built with somewhat stricter conditions. Germany was celebrating: ""Look, the EU is still working, they said! A mockery. The truth is that Germany has only succeeded in pushing through its position against the EU Parliament and the EU Commission. It has organised a blocking minority against a decision of the EU Commission. Solidarity with double standards It is therefore understandable that Poles should only shake their heads when they are more urged to show solidarity. Poland, like the Baltic States, has an aggressive Russia on its doorstep. The construction of Nordstream 2 only confirms this in its policy. The pipeline is just one example of how unfair it is to portray the Eastern European EU countries as worse Europeans. The truth is that they are other Europeans. And that is mainly due to history. For once, let us go back only to the end of the Second World War. These countries were forced behind the Iron Curtain. For decades they had to live under the thumb of Moscow. They have therefore developed less economically. They did not have the opportunity to travel all over the world. Their societies were closed, to the outside and inside. Criticize less, understand more, stay fair Of course, we must criticise the fact that some of them have refused to accept refugees distributed by the EU. But without forgetting that these people do not have decades of contact with immigrants from other cultures. And of course one can shake one's head at the fact that the Poles do not want to adopt the euro. But they see that they are still much poorer than Germany, for example. Although, as statistics show, they work much more. It's understandable that they don't want to become too dependent economically. It is all the more unfair to keep the Eastern European countries close to the USA. They remember that America has always been much more interested in their freedom than its European friends. And they take the polls seriously, according to which not even half of the Germans would want to defend Poland if the neighbouring country were attacked. Yes, many things are going wrong in Eastern Europe. Nationalist and right-wing populist governments are damaging these countries.

The implications of a global average warming beyond 1.5°C are catastrophic. Irreversible losses. The world hasn't seen an economic breakdown like this. The world hasn't seen a mass extinction event like this since the dinosaurs died out.

When we have to relocate metropolitan areas due to rising sea levels, that's an economic disaster.

When we're faced with droughts and famine, that's an economic disaster which likely increases the chance of war.

When whole regions become inhabitable, forcing hundreds of millions to become refugees without a chance to return to their countries ever, you'll have more people struggling economically *and worse* than if we stop right now.

It is a false dichotomy that you can have either environment or economy. We're at a tipping point, where we're about to risk and possibly lose everything, including the economy.

4684,"Assuming 3 trillion euros in a timeframe of over thirty years, that makes 100 billion a year. Yes. Not cheap in absolute terms, infrastructure never is.

But let's compare it to [previous energy subsidies](http://www.foes.de/themen/energie/stein-und-braunkohle/): between 1970 and 2016 hard coal got 337 billion, lignite 100 billion, nuclear 150 billion =&gt; 0.6 trillion all in all. That's less, but also not cheap, and that's just the direct cost. 


Adding CO2 to the atmosphere also leads to costs. Climate change will be insanely expensive, and even a small part of it is very large; open pit mining (for lignite in Germany) is hugely destructive to ecosystems (not only locally, but it changes the hydrology of everything downstream too); Coal contains mercury and other nice things you dont want to burn and get into the atmosphere, etc; 
a [Greenpeace funded study](http://www.foes.de/pdf/2018-06-25-GPE-Studie-Braunkohle.pdf) claims those costs to add up to about 30 billion _a year_ for lignite only. Which only accounts for a part of the electricity production (which in turn is iirc just a third of all energy consumption).

Yes, renewables are not cheap, but there's a lot of hidden cost to burning fossil fuels ... you kinow , screw that juggling with billions of euros.

4692,"I wouldn't say she did ""nothing wrong"" - even if we only focus on Brexit and ignore non-Brexit issues, she made several mistakes. As a Leaver, I think taking no-deal Brexit off the table was a catastrophic mistake. It meant the EU could effectively bully us in negotiations and ensure that the only deal we were offered was one that could never be supported by Leave supporters. I daresay Remainers might have other ideas about what her biggest mistakes were.

However, I think we can also recognise that the role was always a poisoned chalice. She faced the nigh-on-impossible task of uniting a very divided country. I really believe that she thought her compromise was the way to do this, but unfortunately parliament is roughly evenly split between ""hard"" Brexiters, ""soft"" Brexiters, and people who are Remain at all costs - and it's difficult to see any solution to this impasse. You can see it upset her to have to step down yesterday, as she's given everything to the job but will now ultimately be regarded as a failed PM.

&gt; ""The one common misconception about the small black holes that may form at the Large Hadron Collider is that they would swallow the Earth,"" Pretorius said. ""With about as much confidence as we can say anything in science, this is completely impossible.""
&gt;
&gt;To start with, theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking calculated all black holes should lose mass over time, giving it off as so-called Hawking radiation. Tiny black holes should shrink via such evaporation faster than they grow by gobbling up matter, dying within a fraction of a second, before they could engorge on any significant amount of matter.
&gt;
&gt;Even if one assumes Hawking is wrong and that black holes are more stable than that, the tiny black holes would pose no danger. Because the microscopic black holes would be created within a particle accelerator, they should keep enough speed to escape from Earth's gravity.

Also, that Africa thing isn't racism, it's the sad truth on how the continent was ripped straight into the modern world in the 19th century, and how that made it's peoples rather ""inexperienced"" to manage a modern society after the people who were accustomed to said society kinda just left. Of course, some areas are more developed than others and can rely on themselves, but the populous is still heavily agrarian and tribalistic. Thus they're dependent on aid and foreign institutions and this will become even more apparent with climate-change over the years accompanied with a population explosion (ironically near the desertifying regions).
Had Africa developed gradually, I think a plague similar to the one in the 14th and 15th century would've occured, forcing the continent to find solutions to combat the smaller population with technological advancement.

As for the 'race' one... That isn't even about race. And it is a provocation, an ironic statement toward people who use violence to get what they want. It even shows in the text.

I think you youself are making a provo and trying to paint the Finns in a bad light, so our fellow Europeans would think of them as yet another 'rednecked backwards far-right party'.

I'd like to add a thing on their climate change, as people accuse them of climate-denialism. This couldn't be further from the truth. Halla-Aho mentioned in a recent debate that while EU and Finland should continue on doing their own part, they both should stick to realistic goals, as both are the leading force in fighting climate change. Too much cockiness is going to drive industry away (happened to steel in the case of Finland) and make people unhappy and more sceptic toward climate policies (banning private cars would create bus lines that have a passanger maybe once a week, or even a month, and practically force people to centralize into bigger cities, accelerating regional inequality).",,/r/europe/comments/bse3k6/quotes_regarding_race_and_homosexuals_by_jussi/eophryx/,SlimeMan96,1558764513

&gt;Three propositions had to be passed by Alaskans in order for statehood to happen:
&gt;
&gt;* ""Shall Alaska immediately be admitted into the Union as a State?""
&gt;* ""The boundaries of the State of Alaska shall be as prescribed in the Act of Congress approved July 7, 1958 and all claims of this State to any areas of land or sea outside the boundaries so prescribed are hereby irrevocably relinquished to the United States.""
&gt;* ""All provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 7, 1958 reserving rights or powers to the United States, as well as those prescribing the terms or conditions of the grants of lands or other property therein made to the State of Alaska, are consented to fully by said State and its people.""[7]
&gt;
&gt;All three propositions were approved Alaskans in a special election held on August 26, 1958. Voter turnout was high.[7]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_Admission_Act

&gt; Out of a total population of 600,000 in the islands and 155,000 registered voters, 140,000 votes were cast, the highest turnout ever in Hawaii. The vote showed approval rates of at least 93% by voters on all major islands. Of the approximately 140,000 votes cast, fewer than 8,000 rejected the Admission Act of 1959.

This is an issue for the US, because when people move from state-to-state, having their marriage vanish and reform creates a hell of a lot of property and other issues, so in the US, all states are required to honor marriages granted by other states.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_Europe

&gt;In 2010, Romanian LGBT activist Adrian Coman and his American partner, Robert Claibourn Hamilton, married in Belgium, and subsequently attempted to relocate to Romania. Romanian authorities refused to recognise their marriage and the case progressed to the European Court of Justice.[5] On 11 January 2018, the ECJ’s advocate general, Melchior Wathelet, issued an official legal opinion stating that an EU member country cannot refuse residency rights to the same-sex spouse of an EU citizen on the grounds that it does not recognise same-sex marriage.[6]
&gt;
&gt;On 5 June 2018 the ECJ ruled in Coman's favour, stating the term ""spouse"" was gender-neutral, and member states are therefore obliged to recognise EU residency rights for partners of EU citizens. However, the court confirmed that it will still be up to member states whether to authorise same-sex marriage.[7][8]

So it looks like Romania didn't have to recognize the two, but did have to honor at least some EU rights (residency).

Sure. Here's an excerpt from [an article](https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/szansa-na-nowe-polaczenia-kolejowe-z-niemcami-91826.html) published two weeks ago:

&gt; Poland also pointed out the need for further steps to be taken by Germany with regard to the electrification of the cross-border section Zgorzelec - State border - Goerlitz - Dresden. - The project of electrification of the section State border PL/DE - Goerlitz - Dresden should be undertaken much faster than in 2029, because it determines the maintenance and development of transport between the two countries - adds Iwona Budych.

So not only the issues with electrification apparently persist on the German side, the time frame has actually been pushed by nearly a decade from 2020 to 2029.

The article is devoted to a Polish-German Rail Summit discussing the possibility of increased frequencies. Here's another excerpt:

&gt; \- **Cross-border offerings are still too poor in terms of frequencies.** In order for German-Polish rail transport to continue to develop in a sustainable way, it is necessary to develop a stable offer for passengers. Orderly arrangement, close cooperation in the creation of timetables between Polish and German carriers and the expansion of the offer, among others, between Berlin and Wrocław or Szczecin, **should not be treated as a distant vision**, but as a tangible and close future - comments Iwona Budych, President of the Polish-German Association of Passenger Railways.

As far as I remember, increased frequencies is something Polish side wants and German agrees, but does little to implement.

Neither the Democratic party or Republican party in the US really represents their stances from the past- I think the Democratic party took the first hit with the fall of JFK. Neo-conservatives are pretty much Dems now, and DJT supporters generally hate the Republican GOP.

(Jussie Smollett case will also stand as evidence of remaining corruption, as FBI is investigating why charges were dropped on clearly criminal behaviour.)

&gt; Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) wants to give security authorities access to standard end-to-end encrypted chats and telephone calls. Messenger services such as WhatsApp or Telegram should be obliged to record the communications of their customers and to send them to authorities - in a readable form, ie unencrypted. As the SPIEGEL reports in its current issue, providers who do not fulfill this obligation should be banned by order of the Federal Network Agency for Germany.
&gt;
&gt;The project is protesting at the companies concerned. Like WhatsApp , many offer their customers complete end-to-end encryption of all communications content, and so far have no access to such messages themselves. ""That would have catastrophic effects,"" says Alan Duric, co-founder of the Berlin-based messenger Wire. The project was dangerous, it would expose users to unacceptable risks.
&gt;
&gt;The makers of Threema also react reluctantly, of which around five million users live in the German-speaking countries more than 80 percent. ""Absolute confidentiality of communication"" was ""in the DNA of Threema,"" said a company spokesman. ""We are not ready to compromise."" You have no infrastructure in Germany, therefore do not fall under German law. If Germany wants to prevent the use of Threema, ""the country would seamlessly join the ranks of totalitarian states such as China or Iran .""
&gt;
&gt;""Undeniable needs of security authorities""
&gt;
&gt;The Federal Ministry of the Interior wants to push the project fast, because one already sees further dangers in the delay. The move to the next 5G mobile phone standard, it was feared, could complicate the work of the security authorities. As the ORF and the ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"" reported this week, EU counter-terrorism coordinator Gilles de Kerchove is calling on member states to intervene in the current process of 5G standardization, because there is end-to-end encryption as a Part of the 5G standard could be decided. Industry insiders, with whom SPIEGEL has spoken, consider this as good as impossible for technical as well as political reasons.
&gt;
&gt;Nevertheless, the topic will be discussed at the upcoming interior ministers' conference in Kiel in mid-June. According to a proposal for a resolution prepared for this, the round with ""new, fundamental considerations"" should tackle the problem. ""The freedom to use encryption"" must be ""reconciled with the unavoidable needs of security agencies."" According to the proposal, the network providers could set up ""encrypted communication as a rule"" - but, as far as technically feasible, they would have to ensure ""state-of-the-art access to the contents of communication as a legally regulated exemption for their users"".",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/bskkjv/german_minister_of_home_affairs_wants_to_enforce/eoolndt/,vokegaf,1558741650

Let's try to speak in a language that allows more people to follow that interesting conversation you just started:
Imho, the whole text is a huge misinterpretation of the second law of T - which btw is about entropy and not about heat. And more importantly, the second law talks about overall entropy of the universe, so a net lose in entropy is sometimes a valid move, if overall entropy still increases. Anyways, what Spencer missed to tell you is that the sun plays a role. It's a two step process: 1) sun's heating earth. That's energy flowing from a hot system to a colder one. Law 2 holds. Nice! 2) The ""hot"" earth is loosing energy to the surrounding via radiation. Now.. Since the earth is much hotter than the surrounding space, whatever amount of energy is emitted from it, second law holds. Therefore, second law is not in conflict with the theory of the atmosphere holding energy back and heating the system earth. 
Then there is kirchoffs law which syas that a gas emits the same amount of radiation it absorbs. However, the law does not tell anything at all about the direction of emission, which is random for a given molecule. Now this has been measured. And data clearly shows that the net amount of radiation coming back to earth from atmosphere is increasing (and no. That's not coming from the sun). And at the same rate, the amount of radiaton that goes to space is decreasing. The overall net flow into space is still positive however. Second law is happy. It's just less energy that's emitted into space than with less CO2. 
One final thought.what Spencer is failing to do here is to disprove experimental data with his theoretical theories. Doesnt that sound wrong? We KNOW the atmosphere is heating because we can measure it. WE know that CO2 is a greenhouse gas because it has been shown in empirical experiments that it is. Radiation backflow was proven emperically. Now you can come up with whatever theoretical explanation you want (and in this case it's even a wrong one) - you can't disprove the data. 

Im pretty sure whatever I tell you will not change your mind. You already decided that the 99.7% of climate researchers are wrong/bought/part of a conspiracy. Clearly the handful of scientists like Spencer (who is tied to and has been payed by the oil industry btw)  is more likely right.

5084,"Dude, you assume to much. I’m a liberal expat in Poland for over six years now. Not a fan of PiS. They were not in power when I came here. But I have eyes. Which see real life and not news articles. Avoid EU flags? They dropped them as background from some local interviews and statements, debates etc. But to levels common in many countries of the West. Poland was just one of those who went EU flag, maybe not overboard, but had a lot of them compared to others earlier. Under PiS they were NOT removed from official functions where they are required, from government and local offices, even from military parades like last May 3rd, which had a prominent one the same size as the Polish one. So on the streets you still see more EU flags in Poland than in many other EU countries. Don’t trust the media. Do fact checking yourself. Or at least on Street View (Most Polish imagery is updated and from PiS times now and the flags are still prominent in front of every city, regional and state institutions, while in some countries, not so much).

As for blaming everything on the EU, can’t argue with that one, but it’a not new in Poland. The green arrow thingies (which let you turn right on red after double checking) were beloved here and double articulated super long buses (present in the Benelux and other areas) as well as buses with passenger trailers (present in regions of German speaking countries) - both wanted by the public, due to Poland being not rich enough to build metro/s-bahn everywhere that is needed. Those two things, arrows and buses, were banned by the PREVIOUS liberal pro EU government. Also blamed on EU regulations. But what do you know, both things exist in many EU countries, so it was a lie. If there is any EU regulation on the topics, it has lots of exceptions. And Poles wanted one, but did not get it. Blamed on EU. Just two examples of many, from pre-PiS days. So blaming BS on supposed EU laws is nothing new. When every government since 2004 screws something up, makes a bad law, or wants to force something against the will of the people, they try blaming on the EU first.

Really dude. I’m not a fan of PiS, but this propaganda Western and some Polish opposition media is spewing is NOT helping (see polls). Bad tactic. There are many bad things about PiS (see for instance populism, which means they now pay a record high GDP percentage to social payouts to a limited group, which might ruin the economy and other issues). But being “anti-EU” is nit such an issue. And concentrating on it will just focus the eye of the public away from real problems, so help PiS in the end.",,/r/europe/comments/bskw2i/poland_support_for_remaining_in_the_european/eoomh6a/,JoseMikey,1558742259

5089,"&gt;They do. Lion cubs can't hunt without mother showing them how to hunt. And this goes pretty much to every animal. Their accumulated knowledge is just smaller than ours.

There is a biological limit to how much you can learn and understand, this is just a fact. Im sure Lions could be taught all sorts of things but they will never be able to perform, say, linear integration. Also, again, we dont tend to hold children and, idk, tribal people, to the same standards, precisely because they dont have this knowledge.

&gt;but it is something someone wants to eat. 

So? What if someone wants to brutally abuse an animal, should they be allowed?

&gt;Because we are humans and don't need to follow ethics we give ourself when it comes to our food ?

No more than we need to follow any other moral law we apply to ourselves. Morals are typically born out of a logical argument, which once we are convinced by, we find it extremely distasteful to break it; if the arguments for why we shouldnt murder end up applying to animals too, then the exact same limitation applies to us hunting animals.

&gt;Because there is power over us that disallows that. IF that power would be gone we would murder, steal, rape and cannibalize as much as other primates and history proves that with ample evidence. Yes even cannibalize. There are plenty of cases of tribes who didn't find it different than hunting for rabbits.

... what power... From the sounds of it, you think its ""fine"" to kill, rape, steal, ect. as long as you think you will get away with it?

On the basis of which law we can we make such distinction?

&gt;And for those restitution or reparation can then be determined and distributed equally amongst all Jewish Poles their descendands 

And that's because? Who gave you moral right to decide what should be done with property of deceased heirless people? And why it should be distributed equally - surely those who survived weren't equally rich and values of their properties they left behind differed greatly?

5147,"&gt; a new VP is selected and confirmed by the Senate

Slight correction--normally a new VP isn't selected, the post just remains vacant for the duration of the term. The line of succession is something like 30 people long at this point so it's never really a concern.

&gt; And it's afaik impossible to dissolve the House/Senate and have a new vote for all of them.

This is correct. House elections are every 2 years and 1/3 of the Senate is up for election every 2 years. Depending on the state, you might have special elections if a specific member resigns but the position might also be filled by an appointment by the state Governor.

&gt; in the US, (and this isn't about Trump at all), it's very hard to remove the president.

This is absolutely true, but I would argue it isn't that different from other western countries. Removing the President of France is no laughing matter, nor is the President of Germany so replaceable. The difference is principally that over the past 100 years or so, the US President has taken on a much more prominent role in policy-making than the office was originally meant to.",Paris 10eme | US Expat,/r/europe/comments/bsely6/theresa_may_to_resign_on_june_7/eoob047/,Gwenavere,1558734170

But if you imagine, for example, a roughly even three way split where no parties have a majority, but the two last place parties are willing to form a coalition with each other, not the party with the most constituencies, then I believe in this case a government could still be formed without the ""winning"" party coming into government.",Paris 10eme | US Expat,/r/europe/comments/bsely6/theresa_may_to_resign_on_june_7/eoob785/,Gwenavere,1558734312

He invades Crimea, he uses the fact that the Russian Empire and Soviet Union tried to ""Russify"" areas of Eastern Europe to claim that there is a Russian minority under threat and then invade. All while he represses people in his own nation. 

Russian oligarch money isn't going towards higher wages whatsoever - working hours in the UK are some of the longest in Europe and our wages in many jobs have been ""frozen"" - ie the government has stagnated them on purpose whilst the prices of everything goes up. In the UK we've been living under Austerity which means we do *not* have money for our public services. They've been gutted and sold to other nations, with the USA sweeping in to pick the carcass post-Brexit. In fact in the last decade we have lived under the largest transfer of wealth from the poorest to the richest in British history. People do hate the Russian Oligarchs, it has been the source of much controversy in the news here. People break into their empty homes and allow homeless people to stay there.

5345,"&gt; so saying that the environmental movement should've stayed ""apotlitical"" is utter nonsense.

I clearly meant apolitical as non-partisan. It's not a left wing issue, despite your premise. I reject your premise. Preservation of the environment is completely in line with a conservative worldview as well. After all, we want to preserve our way of life for future generations and that includes not destroying climate and the ecosystem.

Culture war has always been more important to most people than environmental issues, specially 50 years ago when we didn't understand the extent of our impact on environment. And once environmentalism became part of the culture war, conservatives who were/are in favor of environmental protection ended up not talking about it. Because of that, there is no vocal conservative environmentalist movement just like there isn't a vocal leftist pro-life / anti abortion movement; they don't want to catch flak from their own side and are willing to compromise some of their principles in order to secure victories in culture war. This is precisely why bringing environmentalism into culture war was a mistake; people who want to protect environment are a strong majority but are divided because one part of the majority is violating other part's core tenents (they're anti capitalist).

5472,"&gt;	New nuclear power plants cost 2.3 to 7.4 times those of onshore wind or utility solar PV per kWh, take 5 to 17 years longer between planning and operation, and produce 9 to 37 times the emissions per kWh as wind.
• As such, a fixed amount of money spent on a new nuclear plant means much less power generation, a much longer wait for power, and a much greater emission rate than the same money spent on WWS technologies.
• There is no such thing as a zero- or close-to-zero emission nuclear power plant. Even existing plants emit due to the continuous mining and refining of uranium needed for the plant. However, all plants also emit 4.4 g-CO2e/kWh from the water vapor and heat they release. This contrasts with solar panels and wind turbines, which reduce heat or water vapor fluxes to the air by about 2.2 g-CO2e/kWh for a net difference from this factor alone of 6.6 g-CO2e/kWh.
• On top of that, because all nuclear reactors take 10-19 years or more between planning and operation vs. 2-5 year for utility solar or wind, nuclear causes another 64-102 g-CO2/kWh over 100 years to be emitted from the background grid while consumers wait for it to come online or be refurbished, relative to wind or solar.
• Overall, emissions from new nuclear are 78 to 178 g-CO2/kWh, not close to 0.
• China’s investment in nuclear plants that take so long between planning and operation instead of wind or solar resulted in China’s CO2 emissions increasing 1.3 percent from 2016 to 2017 rather than declining by an estimated average of 3 percent. The resulting difference in air pollution emissions may have caused 69,000 additional air pollution deaths in China in 2016 alone, with additional deaths in years prior and since.

5488,"Easy. The nation state (in modern terms really ethnostate) was an idea prominent in the 19th (and 20th) centuries. The Habsburg realm was for most of its history a composite monarchy, different kingdoms, duchies and the like all under a single monarch. The various local nobles simply owed their allegiance to their king. No one cared about the peasants, and the aristocracy certainly didn't care about such frivolous things as being one ""nation"" with them. Even during the more centralized and (nation state-like) Austrian Empire the aristocracy would often enough side with their emperor, not their ""nation"" if they were to revolt. 

Prior to nationalism being pushed by nationalist intellectuals, people pretty much cared about their town and that was it. During the middle ages and even the early modern period it was pretty common for people's identities to be defined primarily by religion, not by ethnicity. Nationalist intellectuals eventually ""enlightened"" the people about belonging to a greater whole. Nations were built on propaganda and the spread of the idea of the ""sovereign people"" became perhaps the most defining aspect of the past two centuries, being central to more recent things like decolonization as well.

No, he was referring to cologne being the location where ""mass rape\*s\*"" happend. And that implies that these happen (or used to happen) regularely, which is a complete lie! Not even a single mass rape happend that night in cologne.

&amp;#x200B;

It is a known tactic from right wing media outlets to exaggerate events like this. I mean, let's do a reality check and look at what really happened in cologne that night:

*  19 attempted rapes and 8 rapes reported to the police in Cologne (not a single mass rape)
*  suspects mostly used [sexual assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault) (including [groping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groping)) to distract victims while robbing them of mobile phones and wallets. 
* At the same time there was a group of [Syrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_people) men who formed a ring around an american female tourist and then brought her to her boyfriend 

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_New_Year%27s_Eve_sexual_assaults_in_Germany#Cologne)

&amp;#x200B;

So, for people not familiar with the city and the situation that night DepressedPermaVirgin's statements sound like there are mass rapes by Muslims happening or have happened in cologne, which is false.

The ""both sides"" meme refers to the idea that both generic right and left have faults and misunderstanding and should meet in the middle, which has nothing to do with designating a party far left.

Supporters generally love to emphasize that modern tech is much more cleaner, safer, cheaper, and they don't notice everyone has been selling the same message for decades - much of the new generation won't be even build and well-tested for a decade. Sure, science is pretty solid on this and in theory the engineering solutions are also pretty advanced, but then you actually have to prove, test, finance, ensure, build, maintain, deconstruct, dispose all of it. 

That is, for instance, you need to prove to the public that the cement you're using will last twice or thrice the predicted lifetime, that it will be financially possible to maintain it for that period, that there is financial plan to dispose of the contaminated parts both during operation and after shutdown, and that responsibilities are clearly assigned for all emergency cases.

Yet, if you watch how in any country all operators deal with wear and tear, the waste disposal unless called out on, exploding transformers, overall transparency, how they try to squeeze the last breath out of every plant, and how horrendously a modern country like Japan dealt with an actual disaster, there is simply not a lot of earned here.",,/r/europe/comments/bsdwuj/student_climate_protests_are_still_going_were/eomjvsv/,c-dy,1558690612

5805,"&gt;But an attractive character doesn't need story justification? For them it's enough to be pretty?

Yes, because attractive characters are the default. Almost in all cases characters (especially the main ones) have to make players emphasize with them, and it's a lot easier to do when these characters are good-looking

&gt;I don't think you are aware of how you come across to others. When you complain that there are not enough pretty women in videogames, that you ""hate"" feminism and the left - those ideas are only attractive to people who already believe them, not everyone else. Everyone is put off.

As I understand it, the point of this internet rant is to recruit people who already have a mindset similar to yours, but who haven't been engaging in this rant before recruitment. Like it was with me. I've always had a certain mindset and all it took for me to start engaging in this rant is a few videos/articles on this topic, both leftist and rightist. So, the more people there are involved in the rant, the louder we become, the higher chances we have to be heard. Obviously there's almost no way to change one's mindset about these issues in a short perdiod of time

&gt;That's not a thing, sorry.

But it's literally their words. ""Change this character because she looks too sexy and there're no such women in real life, i.e. make her more fat""

&gt;You say something has been ruined but you never say how exactly it was ruined

Battlefield specifically was ruined by the desire to add tons of women in a game which they advertised as ""historically accurate"". The justification of this, as always, were some typical feminists' points. And the plot itself was shit because when developer's main goal is to be ""woke"" and not to create a decent game, the final product often tends to be shit

&gt;Says who?

Isn't it the place where all these ""social justice"" movements opriginated and evolved into what they are now?

&gt;You are factually wrong. First of all, obesity is not a problem specific to California as 35% of people in the US are obese.

I guess the situation is the same in all the other states then. Sad ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

&gt;Second, obesity has nothing to do with feminism: https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm#what_causes_obesity

Eating habits, diet, physical inactivity, etc. are listed as causes, but what are the reasons people stop caring about that? Doesn't the propaganda which says ""all of you are beautiful by default, plus-sized women are awesome, stop trying to please men with your appearance"" affect women in a way and make them stop caring about how they look like?

Everybody thinks work should pay off. But only the right claims to think thinks that in our present day society work already pays off and uses the ""hard work"" argument against welfare and minimum wage. As if the labour market isn't a thing and people don't simply get paid as little as their employer can get away with. As if there isn't plenty of socially necessary work that doesn't get compensated at all (raising kids, volunteer work, etc). As if having a lot of capital doesn't insulate you from the risks of starting a business.

Besides not everybody is capable of doing hard work, that's where our welfare system comes in, so people who can't work don't get completely shafted. Saying people should just work harder for increased welfare completely misses the point of the system.

Basically your entire comment reads as a defence of economic inequality, which is the opposite of left-wing.

You want a focus on grains for the next years - play a little with the amounts of subsidies and more people will cultivate grains. You want a focus on eco products in order to take care of the health of your population, that would still be cheap enough to compete with non-eco products - give some subsidies for eco products and voila.

(1, shoplifting, 2 pickpocketing, 3 simple mistreatment, 4 threatening  a person 5 property damage, 6 simple theft, 7 reselling stolen products, 8 qualified theft, 9 bicycle theft, 10 remaining)

that they were sorted under 'remaining'.  NO NUMBERS were falsified. The misunderstanding was resolved with 24 hours. There is was additional list that further qualifies the remaing category.
