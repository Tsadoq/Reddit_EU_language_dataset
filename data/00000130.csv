38,"Explain me in economic cycles why China which 30-40 years ago had barely any industry now is basically outdoing everyone else ?
They took 500mln people out of farms into factories.

They build more highways in year than whole EU and US combined in 10 years. They create one coal plant A DAY just to fill out their ever growing needs for energy.

I give you the answer: China after failure of socialism gave free way for 1978 economic reform which basically like in Poland in 89 introduced almost complete free market. You didn't need government ok to start company, taxes barely existed and so on. Instantly in less than 20 years they they build up from nothing into power.

Unfortunately nowdays socialists took over most of those companies boards and started to introduce new laws limiting economic freedoms which slows down their growth to measly 5% and with every new rule it slows down more.

If you would remove most of taxes in EU, EU economies would grow easily in 10-20% a year. People instead of paying ~1,5€ for fuel they would pay 0,5€ for fuel. Instead paying for electricity 15€ per 100kw they would pay 5€. Since fuel and electricity would be much cheaper and there would be no VAT tax instead of buying some food for 10€ people would be buying it for 5€. And this goes for everything.

IF most of rules would be removed then starting business would be as easy as starting doing something and finding people who want your stuff which would instantly move economy into stratosphere.
If patents would be only for 5 years then you would be able to buy medicine for peanuts without recipe. Naturally going to doctor also would cost you much less since everything would be cheaper.",,/r/europe/comments/dw68uq/germany_avoids_recession_with_surprise_return_of/f7h658v/,perkeljustshatonyou,1573733213

114,"&gt; It has a lot to do with whether or not I consider their predictions trustworthy and to what degree I value ""expert consensus"". 

Why do you not consider scientists trustworthy?

The people from 50 years ago are not the same as today. So there is no ""they"".

&gt; But it's not really important. What's important is, supposing what is said is true

It is important because climate change is real and you are still not trusting the people who say so. 

&gt; And throwing some random number of dollars at the problem is not a solution, and it's not even intended to be one. 

Random? Where did you get that idea? 

&gt; That in 12 years Vancouver will be underwater. 

What scientific publication made that claim? 

&gt; Yes, it is. Just like nearly everything else. 

You are seriously arguing that climate change is just a conspiracy to increase your taxes? You can't be serious.

&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK THE MONEY THAT ITALY OR ANY OTHER FIRST WORLD COUNTRY CAN PROVIDE WILL REALISTICALLY DO IN THE FACE OF MASSIVE DEVELOPMENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, 

Stop shouting.

Where did I say that Italy can do that? This is about Venice and Venice can very much do something to reduce the effects of climate change. And they already do.

In other words: Reducing the effects of climate change on Venice =/= Italy solving climate change.

&gt; AND DO YOU HONESTLY THINK WESTERN EUROPEANS/NORTH AMERICANS ARE GOING TO VOLUNTARILY ABDICATE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE IN SUPPORT OF THIS ISSUE?

Where did I say that? And what is your point? People don't like to give up conveniences. So? They either will have to because it just won't be possible anymore or we will find a way to transition to a more sustainable future without giving up hard-fought standards. You want to just give up?

&gt; If you can't address those two specific points with some realistic policy there is no reason to say, or do, anything about climate change.

It is totally absurd to argue that if I don't have the answers then we don't have to do anything. When did I become the leader of the whole world?

119,"&gt;So anything political a billionaire says is to be ignored because they're a billionaire?

No, it's on the basis that billionaires should not exist, let alone have a distorting role in democracy. Billionaires are billionaires because they have extracted inordinate amounts from society, parking it offshore or investing it in making politicians welcoming to their agenda. If they want to keep their billions they should stfu and not use their disproportionate might to interfere in the running of democratic systems. A true democracy wouldn't even allow for billionaires, as most people in a democracy are poor and would be best served by redistribution.

Top tip - next time you want to throw around accusations of someone resorting to an ad hominem (zzzzz by the way); think more.

You hit the nail on the head in your second remark: **Elon does indeed care seriously about making electric cars happen**. However electric cars (that is to say, private transportation) are not what we need for an environmentally friendly, post-colonial future. The resource consumption for individual vehicles is simply too great. **We ought to be focussing on public transport** but you can bet your bottom dollar that Elon will oppose that all the way, with all his money/might.

The fact we talk only of an electric car future and not of a public transport utopia is sign enough that certain interests are already too dominant.",,/r/europe/comments/dw63t3/elon_musk_says_brexit_made_him_decide_against/f7gzf32/,AbdicationOfDoody,1573725866

I'm perfectly all right with all members paying a proportional ammount - however we should look at how big the final pool of money is and how much we truly need and then accomodate the overall expense according to that. 

My above comment was just to give people a sense of how much 2 % of GDP really is. And this is just Germany. If we pool all of NATO together we get an absolutely enormous sum of money. Right now NATO members collectively spend 1 trillion USD yearly which is way up and beyond ANY other countries or bloqs military spending. The only thing remotely close is China which NATO outspends by a multiplies of more than 4. Any other entity is outspend at least 15 times.

296,"&gt;Thats the real problem, not the religion itself

It is the religion itself. The religion is far stronger weapon than any other ideology obtained later in life. Imposed at birth and fed through whole life. This is religion that allowed Jews to still exist despite being fought with for centuries. It is religion that made people fight the Jews in the first place and Judaism that made the Jews separate group of people. It is religion that is now being again used for malicious intent. 

And there are some religions that will make you more brutal towards nonbelievers than other religions. And Islam is that religion. Exactly like sects that would kill random people for the sake of fulfilling prophecy or other bullshit.

I.e. Manson's Family. If Charles Manson was preaching love and compassion like Jehovas Witnesses there wouldn't be any killing from his side. And due to that Jehovas Witness sect isn't taken as a threat for society and can operate while Manson was stentenced.

The same goes with Islam and other religions. If Islam did preach love and compassion or even predestination there would be little to no room for brutal extremism. Yet Islam teaches to kill nonbelievers, to kill apoststes, to fight with everyone with brutal force to impose their beliefs.

No mantras or chanting ""islam is peaceful"" or ""it is just radicals"" will change what Islam has written in its scripture. It is religion of brutal conquest and even in peaceful times the believers will try to conquer nonbelievers as we can see nowadays.

If there wouldn't be base for being brutal in Islam the ""actors"" wouldn't be able to act.",,/r/europe/comments/dvayoi/more_than_half_of_italians_in_poll_say_racism_is/f7gvh8v/,ozomidaf,1573719720

349,"&gt;""With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil—that takes religion.""

All religions are shit. But Islam, especially Wahhabi Islam promoted by rich Saudi Arabia is shit beyond measure. Islam is religion of conquest and its base with sharia law shows it.

And above that all religions are actually sects. All countries(maybe not USA) usually fight with sects that brainwash people so hard that when they do something sect disagrees with the family of offender will cut ties with one. Sectism is dangerous for government and society because it creates uncontrollable mass of people that can riot on a whim for reasons that can't be argued with.

And here we have Islam that works like sect and will not only cut ties with offender of sect, but will literally cut his head off. As they have it in scripture. We have Imams preaching whatever they like anti social and anti government (like Choudary in UK) and being under protection of said government and stupid people who preach ""tolerance for all"".

Somehow Islam doing all this shit is OK and recognized as religion. Other smaller sects are not. (I.e. in Poland Islam is recognized as official existing religion while Flying Spaghetti Monster can't be registered as official religion for 10years now).

In the end if Islam recognized European values it would cease to be Islam. And nobody would have real problem with Islam if it did recognize these fucking values. But life shows it doesn't do it. It is spreading by force and using stupid laws that protect religions to gain influence and momentum.

And lastly it is the mere believers, the ""not radical muslims"" that are also the problem, because as they are part of the sect they will never go against radicals and say that what they do is wrong and try to convince radicals to embrace European values. They just stay and watch the show with silent approval.

That is why Islam, especially Wahhabi is dangerous. Contrary to Hinduism, Sikhizm, Buddhism or Judaism that are somehow doing fine in Europe and Western world without threatening the society.",,/r/europe/comments/dvayoi/more_than_half_of_italians_in_poll_say_racism_is/f7gqie4/,ozomidaf,1573712930

360,"&gt; We need few generations of genuine care and trust among EU nations for Federation to become a real possibility democratic way. 

A ""few"" is usually three or four.

Say a generation is about thirty years.

You're talking ninety to a hundred-and-twenty years.

A hundred and twenty years ago was 1899.

Consider what has happened politically and technologically in Europe since 1899.  The radical transformation of societies, the political systems that fell and rose and fell.

[This is a map of Europe in 1900](https://www.euratlas.net/history/europe/1900/index.html).

And now remember that the EU didn't just spring into existence.

The [Treaty of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome) has been in effect since 1958, so it's been 61 years of gradual integration already.  So, think on the order of 181 years to create a federation.

181 years ago was 1838.

511,"&gt; You're once again believing that the US adopted European norms post WWII. They didn't, otherwise the world would have been completely nuked and, you know, not exist.

Uh huh. And what benefit would the US have from that? Europe did whatever was in its interests. It's the same thing the US is doing. Thing is, nuking the world doesn't benefit whomever is nuking it.

&gt;It's weird how on that map those places still exist. It's almost like the US....didn't do that. 

Weird how you shifted goal posts from threatening to nuke to actually nuking. The USSR nuked less countries than the US did, I guess they were the good guys after all, yes?

&gt;On the other hand, I can show you the places in the world Europeans decided to effectively colonize and enslave. They wound up...doing that. For hundreds of years.

Sure, cause it benefitted us. Nuking them and making their land utterly useless for anything on the other hand wouldn't have benefitted us at all.

Your argument is like saying ""China isn't nuking Hong Kong even though they could! Look how generous they are!""

&gt;Thank goodness the US wasn't like Europe.

Your entire country is founded on genocide, and you were intent on genociding Indians long after gaining independece. Surely you learn about things like the Trail of Tears in school? Yes, what an enlightened country you had. So enlightened that a black athlete at the 1936 Olympics said he was treated better in Nazi Germany than he was in the US: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens#1936_Berlin_Summer_Olympics

&gt;I'd say the public threat of nuking say, an unbelievably petulant post-war newly freed after they surrendered-due-to-lots-of-Anglo/Canadian/US/Austrailian-blood France would have been major news and taken very seriously. I mean, you guys right now think the US is the worst imperalist horrible Satan in history (from what I read) when the US sends mean tweets. A US with the sole nuke threatening someone, I'd have to guess, would make people do what the US wanted.

Don't shift goal posts again. You said if the US was like Europe they would have nuked France after the war. Tell me, what benefit would that have brought? Stop evading, lol.

&gt;Uh.....yeah. The US were victors in the war and could run rough shod over it with whatever the hell they wanted to do. 

They did, the US stole hundreds of thousands of European patents and tied the money from the Marshall Plan to conditions such as contracts going to US companies. This ensured the creation of a long-term export market for the US. You think nuking these markets and making their land unusable would be better?

&gt; Instead, they GAVE western europe over 100 billion dollars in today's money in 4 years (which is almost exactly the amount the EU is giving Poland over *more* time)

The EU has given Poland £116bn in 13 years, with agricultural subsidies around £176bn. The US gave the entirety of Europe £78bn.

Yes, how very gracious.

&gt;If you're European, the fact that you're minimizing the Marshall plan just demonstrates how horribly ungrateful you've become. You don't shit on someone who gives you a firehose when your house is on fire and you need it most. 

Do you feel gracious for France for fighting off the Brits when the US fought for independence? Do you wake up every morning saying ""Oh we should totally have French military bases in our country and buy their weapons instead of developing our own.""

Why would I want to limit Europe's power just because the US implemented the Marshall Plan?

&gt;No it really didn't. 

It did. Your own comment says that even if you exclude EU agriculture subisides to Poland, the US *almost* gave the entirety of Europe as much as the EU has given Poland (""almost"" apparently meaning £30bn less).

&gt;last I checked, Poland wasn't a flaming mess in 2007 with a superior power having the ability to basically take what it wanted

Poland would get even more money if it was a flaming mess, do you have any idea how the EU works lad?

&gt;Uh, the idea that East Timor is a US issue when it was literally colonized by....Portugal for almost 200 years, starting before the US was founded would be a classic case of that apologism. You're literally trying to shift a European centuries long created problem onto the US.

What does Europe have to do with the latest genocide in East Timor?

http://tech.mit.edu/V119/N53/col53boruc.53c.html

&gt;Numerous articles have recently been written pertaining to the crucial situation in East Timor. Major newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, and New York Times have reported that after 24 years of brutal Indonesian occupation, the people of East Timor were finally allowed to decide whether or not they wanted independence from Indonesia. A great deal of coverage was given to the retaliatory actions of the pro-Indonesian militias who wouldn’t accept a decision of independence. Even today, nearly two months after the vote, I can read about the peacekeeping mission in East Timor at the New York Times web site.

&gt;While I do appreciate the amount of attention this crisis is getting in the major media, a few questions still bother me. If Indonesia has been massacring the people of East Timor for 24 years, why is it only now that the American public is hearing about it, and why is it only now that the massacre is coming to an end?

&gt;One possible answer is that the media simply didn’t find East Timor newsworthy. Too many other more important stories may have edged out East Timor for the past two decades. It’s entirely possible. But to believe that the situation in East Timor wasn’t worthy enough to go to press seems hard to digest. Of the 700,000 people living in East Timor, 250,000 were tortured and murdered, thousands remain “missing”, and thousands more have been displaced from their homes. The massacre in East Timor is a genocide whose proportions have not been witnessed since the Holocaust. I don’t believe that the past twenty years have been exciting enough to warrant the complete dismissal of East Timor in the media, do you?

&gt;**A more plausible, yet more frightening, alternative explanation is that the media intentionally ignored the situation in East Timor, but what motives could the press possibly have for doing this? The answer, as I see it, is that the media didn’t want to highlight our government’s involvement in the massacre in East Timor. The military aid the United States has given Indonesia has never been concealed from the public, yet it has never been publicised to the extent that it should have been. If any other country had supplied Indonesia with the arsenal the United States had, rest assured that the response of the media would have been far different. Articles, editorials, and discussions of experts would have all been visible in the media. The media response would have been even more extensive if the United States had a vested interest in the victimised country. The fact is that the United States could benefit a great deal more if Indonesia had control over the natural resources of East Timor. And so it went.**

&gt;**When Indonesia invaded East Timor in the mid-70s, 90 percent of the weapons used were from the United States. Consequently, all media coverage of East Timor dropped to zero. When Indonesia was running out of weapons, President Carter stepped up to loan Indonesia the necessary supplies, and there was hardly a comment in the press. The massacre of the people of East Timor didn’t seem to matter to the American government, and so why should it matter to the American people?**",,/r/europe/comments/dvrnxs/europe_agrees_to_develop_more_weapons/f7g90xn/,Guffy1989,1573697637

""Almost a century later, the number of deaths they assert oscillates between 1.5-2 million.  But the best contemporary estimates by Armenians or their sympathizers were 300,000-750,000 (compared with 2.4 million Ottoman Muslim deaths in Anatolia).""

661,"&gt; Or the difference could be that Bosniaks are Muslims, which led to foreign Muslim volunteers coming to fight on their side, which probably wouldn't be the case for a conflict between Christians? Seriously, it's not that complex.

So in a ceteris paribus situation between Bosnia and Hungary a mere presence of Muslims results in a development of a global Islamic terrorist network? Yeah, I think I'm gonna go and keep attributing that to Islamism surrounding Izetbegovic.

&gt; No, one Bosnian tabloid reported it and it was later covered exclusively by Serbian websites. No one else, not the prosecutors involved nor anything relating to the case have reported this anywhere. Furthermore, there is not one single news outlet which reported that he was ""arrested in a mosque"", which is another piece of propaganda bullshit you are spewing.

Right, the article states that he was located in a mosque in Sarajevo before being arrested, not that he was arrested inside the mosque. It's not ""a piece of propaganda hurr durr durr"", I simply misremembered a sentence, which doesn't make much of a difference, relax. I never read anything about this in Serbian media. I simply googled his name when you mentioned him, which led me to an article written by a Bosniak, for a pro-Bosniak, most circulated daily newspaper in Bosnia. Your immediate reaction was that since it contradicts your claim then they surely must be lying about what the prosecutor said, unless the prosecutor personally issues a separate, official document affirming the suspect's current religious affiliation, 'cause that's what the prosecutor usually does, right? On the other hand, you require no evidence whatsoever for your belief that he is a Catholic, the reason you brought him up in the first place. Just oozing bias.

&gt; A ""major contributor"" is quite a hilarious claim. Find me any evidence that the Bosnian government or that a single Bosniak are involved. I'll wait.

You're again misrepresenting me. When foreign terrorists, for example, are traveling with official Bosnian passports because those of their country of origin are under increased scrutiny from the security agencies, then those passports count as ""a contribution from Bosnia"" - the term i used - even tho you can't name ""a single Bosniak"" who enabled them to get those passports. Why should i be following up a thread that's spun off by your fallacious reasoning?

When most of the major terrorists known to the West have connections to Bosnia, Macron's not gonna sit there hoping that the Bosnian government will investigate itself so that he could ""name a single Bosniak"", he's gonna block your EU accession path. And as i said earlier, whenever you reply to my claims about Bosnia that the whole phenomena is taking place unbeknownst to the government, that's no good either, cause Bosnia is still a security concern with its failed government. 

&gt; They are not ""Muslim areas"", they are French areas in Paris, Nice and Strasbourg. The aim of the article is quite clear and it makes a good point, but you are feigning ignorance on purpose.

I just keep repeating myself. He is not concerned about domestic attacks from Muslim areas in the Balkans, but about foreign attacks coming from those areas, yet that's what the article is rambling about as if it's relevant, as if one determines the other.

&gt; Bosniaks is the correct term for Bosnian Muslims. I know you have been using the deliberately provocative term and refusing to recognize our ethnicity as that aligns with your malicious trolling intent, but I didn't ""make anything up"".

No, it isn't the correct term. There are Bosnian Muslims who aren't Bosniaks. For example, the MENA Muslims that became Bosnian citizens. There is also the Muslim ethnicity which is 12000 members strong in Bosnia and 100000 members strong in the Balkans.

Where the states of the US have a mostly shared history, European countries have evolved more separately, with intense rivalries between them. Even though we are moving closer to each other, we are nowhere near an actual unified entity in the way that the US is.

There are significant linguistical, cultural and ethnic differences between them. Take a look at the proximity of Croatia and Italy on a map and then check out [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/Rza4VcB.jpg) of Croatian and Italian soldiers next to each other. In a similar manner, show me a collection of 9 French people and 1 Dutch person and I'll be able to pick out the Dutch person almost every time.

Another example: I can get in my car, drive for five minutes across the border to Belgium and end up with people who use words I've never heard of (even though we supposedly speak the same language). And should I choose to stay in my own country, I could drive for three hours to the northern part of it and end up with people who speak a completely different language alltogether. I'm not talking about immigrant communities either, but about native populations.

Finally, the EU for most people is nothing more than a collection of bureaucrats in Brussels. I'm pretty sure a minority of Europeans know the names of the presidents of the European Council and Commission. The EU is just not very significant compared to national politics.

684,"I think a mistake that people end up making is that they view the potential systems as either capitalism or everything else. The Nazis certainly did not engage in free market capitalism but that didn't make them socialist in any stretch of the imagination - nor even social democrats since that seems to be the connection that most ""nazis are socialists"" types want to make. They rather made their own thing. Filled with autarky, war economies, hegemonic redistribution based on racial pseudoscience. They certainly didn't engage in any kind of egalitarian stratification efforts

I think socialists (revolutionary socialists that is) sometimes are a bit too quick to jump the gun and say that the NSDAP were hyper capitalists just because capitalism has a hierarchical structure and so did the nazis. The thing was, the Nazis obviously enforced it along racial lines and in a much more brutal and repressive (overt) fashion than say the Americans did. Not to excuse American racism, I certainly wouldn't, but there were some quite brutal enforcement going on. 

On the other hand free market capitalists call the nazis socialists because... government spending means socialism? The Nazi government did massively increase the spending but their tax rates were way lower than other capitalist countries in the west at the time and they funded much of their work by selling bonds in government sectors... and by robbing the Jewish population. Free market capitalists who claim that there were any ounces of socialism in the Nazi party after the night of the long knives shows a real lack of understanding of what socialism is. Everything from the differences between how fascists and socialists view the human condition (Spiritualism with the fascists and material conditions with the socialists) down to, as you say, the goal of racially enforced hierarchy with the fascists and egalitarian equality with the socialists.

Poland's animosity towards Russia is a universal constant regardless of whether Russia has a million on zero tanks, because everything Russia touches turns to shit and we lived in that shit or the stink it leaves for the better part of the last 200 years.  

As for Russia invading Poland, you're right that's it's not the wisest strategic move in itself. But you have to remember a few things:  
a) Russia's governing body is not a fully rational actor. It is a criminal organization willing to go to great lengths to maintain their wealth and power and avoid prosecution for their crimes.  
b) Poland has its own strategic interests in the region. They are, of course, benign and based on willing cooperation of free nations, but wherever they collide with Russia's interests, Russia issues threats of violence. So preparing for violence from Russia is an essential part of conducting Polish foreign policy.  
c) Poland is a friend to all freedom-loving people in the region and a loyal ally to those it signed treaties with, so given Russia's predatory attitude to many of those, that comes with a great risk of being dragged into a war with Russia.

My personal opinion is that the benefits of those systems are obvious to us because we live with them daily. There is very little political will to remove those things, here.

If Denmark joins a republic it would have to e.g. adopt the minimum wage. Denmark currently has no minimum wage. That might not sound like a big deal to you but it actually is a very big deal. It would completely ruin the dynamics of how unions negotiate salaries and working conditions with employers. If Denmark joins a republic we (5 million Danes) would have to convince the rest of the republic that minimum wage is a bad idea and that our system is better. What do we get in return?

896,"~40m2 one bedroom apartments cost around 500-600€ where I live, and yes, the minimum for a family of 4 to live comfortably would be around 1000€. That's already half of the income - take into account that rent has gone up considerably during the last years -.

To that, you have to add between 350-400€/month just in food, assuming no one in the family has any special needs, and at least another 100 in house supplies (probably more because children outgrow or mess their clothes and shoes quickly).

In addition to that, you have to add electricity, heating, water and internet/phone bills. These could fluctuate a lot, but at least is going to be 100-150, a little more if you plan for annual expenses, like insurances.

At this point we've already spent 1550-1650 and we haven't event left the house. Let's assume both adults work in the city: that's currently 54,60€ for a monthly public transport pass for each them, and 20€ for each kid if they have to take the bus, totalling 149,20€. Way cheaper than buying and maintaining a car, by the way. In addition to that, elementary-aged kids would probably stay for lunch at school and do at least one extracurricular activity each (around 60€ per kid and month considering both) 

But that's not the end! Remember, come every September you'll need to spend anywhere between 200-400 in school supplies and textbooks per child. A minimum of 35€ per month for this! 

All of this leaves us with 45-145€ every month for the rest of non-basic expenses: family, work, and friends events: if you know any parent you've probably hear them complain about the miriad of *voluntary-but-actually-mandatory* things they've got to spend on (classmates birthdays every couple months, school trips), in addition to their own kids birthdays, holidays, etc. 

As you can see, we've just scratched the surface of what a reasonable ""more-than-enough"" lifestyle costs, and even then, we've eaten almost all of our budget.

At this point, any unexpected event will fuck up our budget, because we're saving AT MOST close to 50€ a month, which means that, if any appliance breaks, if one of the kids happens to need new glasses, if your third cousin gets married... is coming out of the savings. 

FYI: in this thought experiment, your 50€/month of saving aren't covering summer holidays for 4, I promise.",,/r/europe/comments/dutjco/hello_reddit_i_am_marta_rodríguez_a_spanish/f7fcil9/,ValeriaSimone,1573676546

Yes, we should try to understand why people have these crazy beliefs and how to deal with them.

&gt; So we should be accepting of their instincts and emotions as well?

Accepting of their instincts? I didn't say that.

Yeah, we can say that for millennia (just like religions are telling us not to kill) and yet it won't change a thing about why people do what they do. 

There are reasons for why people do what they do, and with the right incentives we can avoid many destructive behaviors.

&amp;#x200B;

*then the logical conclusion would be to suspend voters rights and errect a authorian regime.*..**IF** you actually treated the people the way you described as being easily manipulated and not knowing what they do. 

I do and did not propose that. I said we need to treat people ad self aware grown ups who know what they do. 

That also means treating people with authocratic and racist tendencies not as poor misunderstood victims, but people with concious ill intend towards others based on ideological grounds. 

&gt; Yes, we should try to understand why people have these crazy beliefs and how to deal with them. 

Understanding them is not the issue. I also do understand paedophiles, communists and Islamists. 

Understanding does not equal justification nor acceptance. 

&gt; Accepting of their instincts? I didn't say that. 

It is the logical conclusion to an objective observation. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Yeah, we can say that for millennia  (just like religions are telling us not to kill) and yet it won't change  a thing about why people do what they do.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are reasons for why people do what they do, and with the right incentives we can avoid many destructive behaviors.  
&gt;  
&gt;There's  no reason to believe in free will. We're living in a  quasi-deterministic universe. Our brain's current states are determined  by its previous states, and so on. Your intelligence, your genes, the  environment you was brought up in (the culture you live in, the friends  you happen to make), none of it is your choice.

Absolutely agreed. BUT....people are capable to make judgments even against their own instincts and biases. There are more then enough examples out there. The capacity for such is there. It is exactly this capacity that enables us to live relatively peaceful to begin with. The reapproachment between France and Germany afdter centuries of war would not have been possible if not a lot of people stuffed their prejudices and started to work together, just as an example. 

Though nobody ever said it is easy, it yet is one of those requirements absolutley mandatory in a democracy because to make it work people have to constantly readjust their own instincts and expecations coming from those. Free will or not, if you lack that capability, then you are not compatible with democracy.

\`now, once their economies are back on track\` refered to CEE countries. And it meant that their economies are (more) functional now as opposed to the past.

My train wreck in the making comment referred to the impact of bloated pension costs on Southern economies. Southern Europe has mostly unreformed pension systems, and the fastest ageing population in Europe.

Between 2008 and 2017, the share of pensions in the EU GDP grew slightly, from 11.6% to 12.5%. No biggie. In Southern Europe, however, this went from:

13.1% to 16.5% in Greece

14.3% to 16.5% (15.9% provisional) in Italy

12.7% to 14.3% in Portugal

9.2% to 12.4% in Spain

So all except Spain are above the EU average, with Spain surely crossing the barrier as its pension system is the least prone to reform with a PSOE government.

These numbers are likely to grow further due to the low fertility skewing the population pyramid.",,/r/europe/comments/dvnc22/people_work_more_years_before_retirement_in_2018/f7ed4rd/,Robi_damian,1573654473

1173,"&gt;poor France and Netherlands, too dumb to understand something they created in the first place and cut out for their wishes.

Loads of voters used that referendum to [express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Dutch_European_Constitution_referendum#Reasons_for_rejection) their discontent with the then sitting government and to express their concerns about the expansion of the EU, mainly regarding Turkey, as well as to express their concerns about the diminishing role of the Netherlands in the EU. For them, it wasn't so much about the Constitution itself.

The same happened with the [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Dutch_Ukraine%E2%80%93European_Union_Association_Agreement_referendum) on the EU-Ukraine Treaty, which voters in the Netherlands also rejected.

That, also, wasn't really about the Treaty itself, but about the EU in general. The initiators even stated it themselves [in public](https://nos.nl/artikel/2096268-initiatiefnemers-referendum-oekraine-kan-ons-niets-schelen.html) (Dutch article); they didn't care about the EU-Ukraine Treaty, instead, they wanted to express their discontent with the EU. Or to put it in their own words: ""Of course we don't care about the Treaty. Since we cannot have a referendum on Nexit itself, we will use anything else we can get our hands on to put pressure on the relationship between the Netherlands and the EU.""

Mind you, this was *before* the Brexit referendum. Things have changed now.

Of course, a substantial group *did* vote against the Constitution, but it's safe to say that the referendum was flawed, to say the least.

Which is not uncommon to happen with referendums, especially those regarding international treaties and constitutional changes. Those things go beyond most ordinary people's comprehension. That's why we elect people to get into the matter for us.

1226,"Stop getting triggered out of place. Before anything else, race is distinct from ethnicity and the topic here is racism. Ethnicity ignores appearance even though there can be an inconsistent correlation due to social constructs.

Race however includes appearance and social characteristics. Racism involves viewing people through the lens of race and believing one is better than another. *« Racial discrimination often coincides with racist mindsets, whereby the individuals and ideologies of one group come to perceive the members of an outgroup as both racially defined and morally inferior. »*

&amp;nbsp;

A definition of race for the record, with the social part of the notion highlighted since I believe is it not well known :

&gt; Modern scholarship views racial categories as *socially constructed*, that is, race is *not intrinsic to human beings but rather an identity created*, often by socially dominant groups, to establish meaning in a social context. *Different cultures define different racial groups*, often focused on the largest groups of social relevance, and these definitions can change over time. [...]

&gt; According to geneticist David Reich, ""while race may be a social construct, differences in genetic ancestry that happen to correlate to many of today’s racial constructs are real."" These biological differences in geographic ancestral populations are not consistent with zoological definitions of race, and *there are no ""sharp, categorical distinctions""*

&gt; Although commonalities in physical traits such as facial features, skin color, and hair texture comprise part of the race concept, *this linkage is a social distinction rather than an inherently biological one*. Other dimensions of racial groupings include *shared history, traditions and language*.

&gt; When people define and talk about a particular conception of race, they create a social reality through which social categorization is achieved. ^^[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)#Defining_race)

The latter bit raises the pertinence of thinking with the race lens, but right now we're limited to colour/appearance so let's leave it aside.

&amp;nbsp;

Americans do think in communities and colour/appearance and tend to assimilate both, potentially erroneously. For instance an African American like Trevor Noah may think that many French football players from the 2018 World Cup are of his race, when they are much more of mine, even though my skin is white. Their ancestry comes in part from North African countries, in part from France. His ancestry is South African. They share my history, traditions and language, not his. Culturally the way Noah's thoughts are structured is alien to them, while mine are very relatable. They are much more similar to me than they'll ever be to him.

Yet because their skin is black, he classifies them as belonging to his own community/identity, to their own stated displeasure. Through the way he thought, he denied their social reality and dragged them to his own racial group which to him is his community. (The French overwhelmingly reject communities as desirable social constructs, so he is even more alien to the football players.) 

And he did all of this just by looking at their skin colour. There's a reason I said *« the pertinence of thinking with the skin colour lens is a topic of its own but that's how it is in the US so we can only roll with it »*",,/r/europe/comments/dvayoi/more_than_half_of_italians_in_poll_say_racism_is/f7e514a/,_Handsome_Jack,1573646778

We can all agree that what many imams preach is bullshit (treatment of women, homosexuals, that there is only *one true* religion etc), but that doesnt give us the right to condemn *everybody* whos practicing islam. There are very good examples in western europe for well adjusted, integrated moslems, who do not believe in those interpretations, after all. And besides, idiots can be found in any religion, just look at the USA for christian idiots.

&gt;**Timely Warning and Interception with Space-based TheatER surveillance (TWISTER)** : The spectrum of threats on the European territory is evolving towards more complex and evolving air threats, notably in the missile domain. The project therefore aims at strengthening the ability of Europeans to better detect, track and counter these threats through a combination of enhanced capabilities for space-based early warning and endo-atmospheric interceptors.It promotes the European self-standing ability to contribute to NATO Ballistic-Missile Defence (BMD)

&gt;**Maritime Unmanned Anti-Submarine System (MUSAS)** : The Maritime Unmanned Anti-Submarine System (MUSAS) aims to develop and deliver an advanced command, control and communications (C3) service architecture, for anti-submarine warfare, taking advantage of cutting-edge technology and artificial intelligence, in order to counter area denial methods of adversaries. Moreover, it will enhance the protection of underwater high-value infrastructures as well as sea-based energy systems, providing quick response with appropriate levels of force to intrusion or threat to sea lines of communication

&gt;**Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA)** : This capability will allow European and NATO air forces to safely operate within EU territories and for the projection of force in other potential areas of operations. The system shall be interoperable with the existing and planned EU member states assets and in cross-domain operations. The project covers the design, development and testing of a multi-jamming capability (including stand-off, stand-in and scort jamming), that will be based in state-of-the-art existing technological cores at European industries level, including in particular Cyber Electro Magnetic Activities(CEMA). The system should follow a modular development approach, able to be integrated inside the aircraft or in a pod configuration, in order to be compatible with different aircrafts, manned and unmanned, of interest of the EU member states. The goal of the system is to enable a platform for Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) missions that could adapt to the latest in electronic warfare requirements, which include (soft) suppression of enemy air defences, escort/modified-escort role, non-traditional electronic attack, self-protected/time-critical strike support, and continuous capability enhancement

&gt;**Integrated European Joint Training and simulation Centre (EUROSIM)** : The objective is to establish a tactical training and simulation cloud based network which could connect and integrate the geographically spared simulation sites and training capacities into one real time, joint level simulation platform.

1707,"&gt;Yes you called me the same as the other side, which would be sensible if the other side had a plan, a clear ideology except for division and spreading it. 

Don't worry, read it again as many times as you need, you are not there yet but I think you can make it.

&gt;Except they don't. Everything Spanish, including their status as Spaniards is a perversion while being totally oblivious to the fact that recently you had a new constitution voted on in which 90 something percent voted for the constitution and look at the special status it has woven for itself since! 

You need to understand the idea that something being the law doesn't make the law legitimate and fair. Would you agree that a constitution is legitimate to the degree it conveys the will of the people it claims to represent? It's a very basic concept so I'm going to assume the answer is yes.

The spanish constitution has hugely important parts in it that are, as even admitted by the people in power during its creation, straight up not a reflection of the will of the people. I'm thinking for example of the monarchy, since Suarez [admitted that the original plan was to put the king to a referendum, but since it looked like they would lose, they just forced the monarchy into the hardest part to change of the constitution, no vote, appeals or alternatives allowed](https://www.lasexta.com/programas/sexta-columna/noticias/asi-confeso-adolfo-suarez-por-que-no-hubo-referendum-monarquia-o-republica-haciamos-encuestas-y-perdiamos_20161118582ef9fe0cf244336f09709f.html). He was dumb enough to ""admit"" this on this particular issue because he thought he wasn't being recorded, but the truth is that we can't know how much of the constitution follows the same principles, since its drafting was fully made by a very select few, it had literally no input from the people it claims to represent, at times, such as this one, going directly against what they would want.

90% of people who could vote didn't affirm the constitution, it was 58%. The referendum to approve it was also full of [irregularities](https://elpais.com/diario/1978/12/07/opinion/281833202_850215.html): the voter census was changed midway after the vote had been called, changing who could and couldn't vote midway, different governing bodies used different census to count the votes, thousands of people who could vote were not allowed to do it in the end, up to 30% voting irregularities were registered in some provinces, a million people where registered to vote twice due to the conflicting census, the night after the vote, the government wouldn't put out the information on the results and the ministry of interior ""era incapaz de ofrecer datos fiables sobre el porcentaje de votación en el referéndum y ofrecía informaciones obviamente mutiladas a través de televisión."", also [abstention was huge](https://elpais.com/diario/1978/12/07/portada/281833202_850215.html) and ""abstention"" here includes people who tried to vote but coudln't.

These are the legitimacy foundations of the constitution the paper you treat as the holy grail and on which the entire state is based on has. A constitution with absolutely no input from the people it claims to represent, going against their wishes in we can't know how few or many things, and a referendum full of irregularities. It's funny that you later write:

&gt;Referenda are not some holy grail of democracy

and yet the referendum, conducted under a still literal fascist dictatorship and approved by a shoddy, poorly made referendum is somehow the one thing we still shouldn't change and we should be basing our decisions around 50 years later.

&gt;You can wail all you want that your narrow definition of a real catalan (not a botifler ofcourse) stops simply because they live in one part of the country or because they sense this strong NATION of catalans running through their veins, but this doesn't make this more democratic as you want us to believe, especially since catalans are spaniards too and many consider themselves as such! In fact coupled with the propaganda spread about genetics make me think of other era's than you apparently.

&gt;Then you can double down and literally spew catalan nationalism, most of which is constructed by industrial elites, who ironically want independence for reasons terribly different than the average anarchist/communist/secessionist disrupting the border right now all flying your banner of democracy. Which apparently means you can disrupt society to the point where small minorities would be able to influence everybody just for the sake of having an opinion. 

The rest of your comment is, again, just you arguing against the version of your ""opponents"" you've created in your head. You are talking to me, not some made up person from twitter, so please answer what I'm saying and not some strawman or I'm just gonna be done with this. Everyone in catalonia is equally catalan, regardless where they come from or where their parents where born, which is why everyone agrees everyone there should be able to vote on the referendum and have their say on it. Noone is demanding restricting people's vote on ""genetics"" and so on (and no, if you can find some person or comment on twitter saying it, that is still not ""evidence"" of anything, the same way I have the decency of not trying to claim that the opinions of the many neonazis that are popping up lately in spain are not the representation of everyone there so I can have an easy ""bad enemy"" to take down).

&gt;You might be wholly unaware of how other countries solve this problem while still allowing protest but for example: in the netherlands there are designated zones, so that the average citizen can still peacefully live and work and function while others voice their concern peacefully. I dont see much of this any more.. Maintaining some level of mutual respect, not dropping down middle of the aisle crying like a child, ""this is how children voice their concerns bur hur!""

Ok? Not sure what this is supposed to prove or mean. [Civil disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience) is still a fundamental tennet of a healthy democracy and we would be a lot less advance than we are not if it weren't because of it.

&gt;Accepting the constitution at the time, as many catalans put it was necessary... necessary for what? An eventual divorce? So you can first push a culture of suspicion for other spaniards and general distaste for them through your own tv's and propaganda machines paid for by all Spaniard and influence as many people as possible to vote for independence later? Like where does this attitude remind of us? By all means necessary...? 

Mate you literally have all the journalists of spain's public tv denouncing how they are [forced to put out propaganda](https://www.infolibre.es/noticias/medios/2018/06/04/los_periodistas_tve_denuncian_mas_nuevos_casos_censura_manipulacion_entre_enero_marzo_83609_1027.html) to suit the government's needs. Maybe you don't need to look so far if you wanna find propaganda machines.

&gt;So then you've got your charade going on, so heavily invested at this point, that nobody actually stopped and wondered what would happen in case it became independent, suddenly the rightwing locos and the leftwing perraflautas will rejoice together and live happily ever after in the utopia of catalunya?

Yes, different people support independence for very different reasons, on that I agree with you 100%. That is, however, not an argument on why they should or shouldn't do it, it's just different political groups working together on a common goal, which is a normal thing.

&gt; For Europe to stumble from one shitshow to another, that's not what I would like for Europe and thats why I dont degrade myself to petty nationalism while stammering politically correct and politically two faced message. Yes I know democracy, I live in the same one as you do.

Nationalism is the main force behind spanish unity as well, engraved on the general mentality on the holy unity of spain, to the point in which people are happy to see their own political rights being taken away as long as it's used to deal with independentists. You can be absolutely against independence, and still oppose a police brutality response and respect that people should be able to have their say on it, like podemos in spain. And I agree that the situation can be difficult to manage for the eu, but again, something being hard to manage is not a reason why it should or shouldn't happen.",,/r/europe/comments/dv9li1/france_police_trying_to_unlock_the_blocked/f7d9vil/,Potato_Doto,1573611297

1720,"Angela Merkel has urged Europe to seize control of its data from Silicon Valley tech giants, in an intervention that highlights the EU’s growing willingness to challenge the US dominance of the digital economy.
The German chancellor said the EU should claim “digital sovereignty” by developing its own platform to manage data and reduce its reliance on the US-based cloud services run by Amazon, Microsoft and Google. 
“So many companies have just outsourced all their data to US companies,” Ms Merkel told German business leaders. 
“I’m not saying that’s bad in and of itself — I just mean that the value-added products that come out of that, with the help of artificial intelligence, will create dependencies that I’m not sure are a good thing.”
Her speech, at an employers’ conference in Berlin, shows the extent to which the information economy is emerging as a battleground in the EU-US trading relationship.
It also highlights the concern in European capitals that the EU could be weakened by the market dominance of the big US tech companies, particularly in the business of storing, processing and analysing data.
Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s powerful competition chief who is now also to oversee EU digital policy, last month told the Financial Times that she was examining whether large internet companies could be held to higher standards of proof in competition cases, as part of a tougher line on dominant companies, such as Google.
Ms Merkel was speaking just two weeks after Berlin unveiled plans for a European cloud computing initiative, dubbed Gaia-X, which it has described as a “competitive, safe and trustworthy data infrastructure for Europe”.
At the conference on Tuesday, Peter Altmaier, economy minister, said the data of companies such as Volkswagen, and that of the German interior ministry and social security system, were increasingly stored on the servers of Microsoft and Amazon. “And in this we are losing part of our sovereignty,” he added.
He said 40 companies had signed up for Gaia-X, including Deutsche Telekom, SAP and Bosch, and the new platform would be ready by the end of the year. “We want to be able to offer companies . . . ministries and governments the chance to store their data in Europe, according to transparent, clearly recognisable standards.”
But some business groups are sceptical of his plans. “While the intention to strengthen digital sovereignty is absolutely right, there are still big questions — such as how do you combine so many different players in an effective way?” said Susanne Dehmel of the digital lobby group Bitkom. 
“It’s also not completely clear to me what the attraction is for service providers to become part of this network, and whether it would really be able to offer customers a competitive alternative to existing suppliers.”
Mr Altmaier has become a figurehead for efforts to strengthen Europe’s defences against the encroachment of US and Asian tech giants. He recently wrote to Ms Vestager urging her to adopt a harder line on dominant online platforms such as Google and Facebook.
“In the light of current developments in the global data and digital economy, we require tougher oversight of abusive practices in order to maintain competition,” he wrote. “Specific rules of behaviour need to be imposed on market-dominating online platforms.”

Ms Merkel has also long been exercised by the question of digital sovereignty. In speeches over the past couple of years she has underscored the power of the US and China over data, contrasting the American approach — where big companies have come to dominate the business of storing and processing data — with the situation in China, where the state exercises its vast powers to access the data of its citizens. 
“Just as with the social market economy, which we in Europe are very proud of, it will probably be necessary for us to find our own path [when it comes to data],” she said in September.
But in Davos last year she complained that Europe was taking too long to find this unique path. “We Europeans have not really decided yet how we want to deal with our data,” she said. “[And] there is a great danger that we end up being too slow, that while we are still debating the philosophical question of data sovereignty, the world just rolls over us.”
Emmanuel Macron has expressed similar fears. In an interview with The Economist published last week, the French president said that in Europe it was companies that decided whether to co-operate with US and Chinese manufacturers on projects such as 5G. 
He said if governments allowed this to continue, “in 10 years’ time, no one will be able to guarantee the technological soundness of your cyber-systems, no one will be able to guarantee who processes the data, and how, of citizens or companies”.",Lake Bled connoisseur,/r/europe/comments/dvkw86/angela_merkel_urges_eu_to_seize_control_of_data/f7dak59/,MelodicBerries,1573611784

1792,"&gt;	Composed around 1638,[citation needed] Miserere was the last and most famous of twelve falsobordone settings used at the Sistine Chapel since 1514. At some point, it became forbidden to transcribe the music and it was allowed to be performed only at those particular services at the Sistine Chapel, thus adding to the mystery surrounding it.

&gt;	Three authorized copies of the work were distributed prior to 1770: to the Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I; to the King of Portugal; and to Padre (Giovanni Battista) Martini. However, none of them succeeded in capturing the beauty of the Miserere as performed annually in the Sistine Chapel. According to the popular story (backed up by family letters), fourteen-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was visiting Rome when he first heard the piece during the Wednesday service. Later that day, he wrote it down entirely from memory, returning to the Chapel that Friday to make minor corrections. Less than three months after hearing the song and transcribing it, Mozart had gained fame for the work and was summoned to Rome by Pope Clement XIV, who showered praise on him for his feat of musical genius and awarded him the Chivalric Order of the Golden Spur on July 4, 1770. 

&gt;	Some time during his travels, he met the British historian Charles Burney, who obtained the piece from him and took it to London, where it was published in 1771. The work was also transcribed by Felix Mendelssohn in 1831 and Franz Liszt, and various other 18th and 19th century sources survive. Since the lifting of the ban, Allegri's Miserere has become one of the most popular a cappella choral works now performed.[3]",Bavaria,/r/europe/comments/dvlpwt/miserere_mei_deus_one_of_the_most_holy_and_secret/f7dg8wu/,untergeher_muc,1573615982

1842,"So in the end it’s just three countries with earlier programs
extending into the 70s. The Finnish study you linked (picked
at random) found an overrepresentation of Gypsies relative to
total population in the eugenics orders during the 1950–60s
(not later, the program was terminated in 1970). While that
proves that Gypsies were targeted as an ethnic group, the
study also concludes

&gt; The emergence of Gypsies as targets of sterilization
&gt; policies was not part  of a nationwide, centralized Gypsy
&gt; policy however. […] It therefore seems obvious that in
&gt; terms of sterilization orders, the slight over-representation
&gt; of Gypsies resulted from clearly unintentional actions by
&gt; initiators of the policies. *All in all, it does not appear that
&gt; the Gypsies were deliberately subjected to a coercive
&gt; sterilization policy.*

(My emphasis. Note that the study makes an important
distinction between forced sterilization (orders) and voluntary
sterilization requested by the applicant.) Furthermore the
article estimates the share of Gypsies of the overall population
of Finland at 1/1000. Using the [numbers from Wikipedia]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Finland#Population_history)
that would have amounted to ~4600 during the 1960s.
With a total of 33 cases of *forced* sterilization up to 1970
(not including the 86 voluntary cases which you conveniently
counted), that is a little less than 1/100 of Gypsies affected –
a far cry from the systematic and complete forced sterilization.
Frankly, your own source contradicts your claim.

That’s quite a different picture than your sensationalist claim
that *eight* “countries sterilized them all in the 70s”. That is
simply untrue as confirmed by your own sources.

1859,"&gt; All in all, I'd say it's more of a socio-environmental thing than a race thing. 

Of course, but the thing is that races (and other types of dividing people into groups) aren't equally represented in various socio-whatever classes, and since you have those over-/under-representations, you can draw conclusions like 'chance that given person of race X living in given area being a criminal is higher than for race Y' and they're not false.

Let's assume for a moment that the only source of criminality is being brought up in poverty. Let's assume you have blue and pink people. 10% of blue people are poor, whereas 80% of pink people are poor, while blue people make up 70% of the population. Of course, from the national point of view the best way to fight the criminality is to pump money into areas inhabited by the pink people and encourage interaction between those two groups, so that poverty (and thus criminality) can be lowered. But from the point of view of a fair person (no matter whether you are blue or pink) it just doesn't make sense to engage into any kind of interaction with pink people (80% chance of being a victim of criminal activity), let alone pump money in there (if someone is blue and their family is blue and so all the neighbours why would they give any money to pink people? Both blue and pink people deal with difficulties in everyday life, so if blue can be rich then pink can be rich too! Moreover a rich pink person will be able to use services provided by blue people, instead of seeing the money being eaten by his poor family), so they gather in blue areas of wealth, leaving pink areas of poverty behind.

Those two points of view are totally valid, but they differ by the definition of 'the group I belong to'. If primarily you feel a citizen (you speak the same language and observe the same customs as both blue and pink people), then secondary a blue person, then a pink person is, in certain way, a member of your group that is in deep shit and needs help. If primarily you are a blue person, then secondary a citizen (blue people have existed millions of years, whereas countries rise and fall in the blink of an eye), then pink people are invaders living off your wealth.

Through the history nations that did not defend their identity lost it and got incorporated into more powerful cultures. On the other hand internal divisions led to civil wars that, again, end in being conquered by a third party.

1902,"&gt;Dude I called them selfish because all I ask is to share the territory as everyone in the rest of the autonomous communities already does.
Again with the non existent right for self determination, it originally was a right for old European colonies and later was extended to add territories with heavy oppression like Kosovo. It was not made with rich communities in mind.

It is not selfish to seek the right of self determination it's a human right for FFS, It applies to everyone not just poor states. You can't just push it aside because you think Spain is somehow exempt from it because It's ''rich''. Fact is Catalonia is culturally,politically even it's language is  different from the rest the Spain and wish to have the chance to choose to leave it. The right to self determination covers that. 


&gt;Are you a troll? It literally is a right and a real one with legal ramifications.

No are you? show me where it says its a human right to live and work anywhere you please? Or that Catalonia wishes to restrict immigration? Or leave the EU? 


&gt;I'm getting tired of spoonfeeding you everything, you literally said ""it's other parts of spain that doesnt"" and I mentioned Madrid, a rich community that pays its fair share and doesn't pull this kind of stunt. Solidarity is the basis of social democracies deal with it.

Then say what you mean instead of being obtuse. You literally said Catalonia wishes to leave because ''doesn't want to pay it's fair share'' implying it's a drain on resources when it's clearly not you response was Madrid? They don't wish to be apart of your social democracy.
 or at least enough don't that's it's a problem.

In fact, they supported the no confidence vote as much as PSOE supported that government you said was a deal between the three parties, since PSOE also implicitly supported that government by abstaining from voting against it. 

With that said, one might argue it was a good thing what Ciudadanos did by abstaining there since the party in government was riddled with corruption and also seemingly incapable of dealing with the problems they faced. 

But it is easy to see they didn't do it out of their sense of responsibility for their country, but for two reasons. First, because they would face backlash in the polls if they supported the PP at a time when the party as a whole was being sentenced for corruption. And second, because they interpreted this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get rid of the PP and substitute them in the center-right political space.

If you look at their actions from then until the April elections through that lens, you'll see Ciudadanos were very constant in trying to achieve this goal. Move their ideology ever-so-slightly to the right, oppose PSOE as a radicalized left wing party to show their own position to the right, claim the leadership of the opposition even when by definition they were not it...

There is a little bit more than where someone is born in how they are defined.

On the other side, poor immigrants generally think it's a really good opportunity for them to get better jobs and integrate. Note how I say generally in both cases? There are thousands upon thousands of people in both groups who don't conform to that, and it's stupid to tar them with the same brush. 

Now, if you look at comparable groups of native born and foreign born people, the crime statistics are actually very similar. But you don't care about that, because you just don't like foreign people.

&gt; Would you support the US military marching into Washington DC because of reports of faulty elections in the US?

Depends on how faulty and if every other avenue of law has been exhausted.

...

Did you even read either report?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Because he tried to pacify the country and stick out an olive branch to the right-wing opposition?

Which is why he resigned, after losing support of the military, the police, &amp; no obvious avenue to quell protests. Him claiming he was forced out is political posturing.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; The military forcing the president to leave office (""losing support"") is a coup.

How exactly did the military force Morales to do anything? 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Do even realise what you are a saying here?

Most definitely. You jump to conclusions, assume the positions I hold, and commit logical fallacies; I understand what you are saying as well.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; What this confirms is that Chavez did nothing wrong by replacing the white officer corps of Venezuela who are the descendants of the old colonial landed gentry with indigenous, brown and working class people. There you have a loyal military and not a rogue one.

Yes, it's very loyal to Maduro when it should be loyal to the Venezuelan people instead.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Maybe this is because the US never ever supports a left-wing leader. Except maybe Rojava, but that has ended now too.

The U.S. recognizes elections where left-wing leaders come into power quite often. See AMLO for one example (though with the recent narco violence, who knows if he has the support of the people for much longer).",,/r/europe/comments/dv44a6/why_bolivian_politics_suddenly_matters_to_putin/f7ccr3t/,form_d_k,1573589413

I'm guessing that a number of those are companies that aim to leverage low labor costs...but China no longer has the lowest labor costs out there.  So they're off to the next country with low wages.

It is in response to this that China, backed by billions of dollars in investment from its government, has vigorously moved into higher value manufacturing.

2114,"1. There are also similar and detailed criticisms of Peterson in psychology publications that are *not* primarily focused on his politics (here's a detailed one from [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hot-thought/201803/jordan-petersons-murky-maps-meaning)). 


2. Rational Wiki may be biased and sometimes over-the-top, but this section sources its quotes and they are *from Peterson himself*, with links to the specific times in his Youtube lectures. So, this time, for this specific collection - unironically.

3. If your problem is believing anything from left-leaning sources even if it is fact-based, you can also find similar criticisms of Peterson from center-right. I had a [decent one from Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/04/god-is-ted-jordan-peterson-self-help-men/) written by two psychology professors, but the site keeps throwing up a paywall recently.

4. I linked /r/askpsychology because (like much of Reddit), it still can be used to establish collective positions - both in terms of agreement and disagreement - *after proper filtering*. First you have to dismiss all highly biased or non-nuanced posts (like ""X is entirely bad"" or ""X is entirely great"", or with visible namecalling) and non-argued posts (""X is Y but I won't tell you why""). Then you can apply ""what opponents agree with and adherents disagree with"" to the remaining nuanced posts. Most remaining reasonable responses in the thread (much like detailed professional critiques outside) seem to agree that Peterson is one of the top few specialists in his narrow area - the theory of personality, and his basic psychological advice is solid. Then most also say that extending limited experience of psychology with a lot of unknowns into the realm of philosophy is very questionable, and that the originality of his solid ideas is not necessarily high. It is valuable that some detailed responses agree and some disagree with his politics (dominance of the left-wing discourse in arts/humanities is acknowledged as a problem), so there is at least some balance in the remaining set of responses.",⚑ For the glory of Chaos ⚑,/r/europe/comments/dv8936/wolfgang_streeck_one_of_germanys_most_important/f7c0zzm/,Idiocracy_Cometh,1573582024

2168,"&gt;It's not just the hijackers that were Bosnian mujahideen. All levels of Al-Qaeda were present in Bosnia where they could run planning, funding, training and recruitment of operatives among thousands of mujahideen with impunity.

No evidence at all that suggests that, nor were there ""thousands of mujahideen"" present in Bosnia - the only sources that claim this are biased Serb war-crime apologist sources like Blic. 

&gt; Is your claim that they could do that in Bosnia and not in Hungary simply because Bosnian government was unaware that it was happening?

The reason they were present in Bosnia was because Serb forces were implementing a campaign of genocide, ethnic cleansing, mass murder, cultural destruction, mass rape and forced deportation against the Bosniak population, not the Hungarian one, which led to the presence of Islamic humanitarian organizations and of foreign volunteers in BiH. Not very complicated to understand.

You additionally conveniently ignored my question - the Benevolence International Foundation was present in Georgia, Russia, China, Croatia, Azerbaijan United Kingdom, United States and others, and its terrorist operations were not discovered until 2002. Does this mean that the aforementioned countries were also ""responsible for 9/11"", or does that not fit your despicable propaganda narrative?

&gt;The Croat was arrested in a mosque in Sarajevo and told the investigators that he had converted to Islam and that he came to Bosnia to study Islam. The two of them would thus be connected to two Islamic terrorist attacks.

Another tabloid lie. He was not ""arrested in a mosque"", nor did he ""convert to Islam"". The only sources which have reported this are click-bait newspapers and Serbian tabloids, it hasn't been verified anywhere. The only official document from Belgian prosecutors accuses him of being part of an organized criminal network focusing on prostitution, drug dealing and arms smuggling. Nothing  to do with 'Islamic terrorist attacks'. But, your original point was to try and claim that Bosniaks had widespread involvement in the Bataclan attacks which is also complete bullshit, although your aim is to deliberately mislead people anyway.

&gt; The author of the article brought it up to prove how France has a terrorist underground and Bosnia doesn't.

The author of the article made a very clear point which is that hundreds of French civilians have been killed in terrorist attacks in the last decade while not a single Bosnian has. Macron claims that Bosnia has a problem with jihadists while there are hundreds of terror cells operating in France who have led to synagogues needing armed security and churches are being burned or desecrated on a daily basis. You took the opportunity to burst in with Serb propaganda mythology about how Bosniaks are ""*responsible for 9/11*"" which has nothing to do with the article at all.",Bosnia and Herzegovina,/r/europe/comments/dutg94/france_is_the_ticking_time_bomb_not_bosnia/f7c273o/,baci_napolje,1573582779
2169,"&gt; but that project was not clear at all

To the contrary, it was very clear. Schuman, Adenauer, Monnet &amp; co were all extremely transparent in what they envisioned for the EU. The Treaty of Rome explicitly establishes the primacy of European Law, QMV, FoM —and importantly— introduced the principle of the ""ever closer union"". That was almost 2 decades before the referendum. I can't recall if the monetary union was mentioned in Rome but it was certainly on the EEC's agenda by the 1970s, as was enlargemement. So from the European end, there was certainly no deception.

As for British politicians and media, there is no evidence that either groups misled the public or tried to obscure the reality of the EEC. Before the referendum, PM Heath even co-signed a joint statement at a European Summit calling for a transformation into a ""European Union"" and establishing an Economic and Monetary Union. Here's Heath in 1972:

&gt; [*The community which we are joining is far more than a common market. It is a community in the true sense of that term. It is concerned not only with the establishment of free trade, economic and monetary union and other major economic issues, important though these are — but also as the Paris Summit Meeting has demonstrated, with social issues which affect us all — environmental questions, working conditions in industry, consumer protection, aid to development areas and vocational training.*](http://blogs.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/161/2013/01/1973Jan01-2-.jpg)

That's not to say the EU hasn't changed since then, but Maastricht, Amsterdam and Lisbon did not fundamentally change the nature of the project in the way Brexiteers insist, nor should their provisions come as a surprise to anyone paying attention in the previous decades.  

The British changed their mind between 1975 and 2016, it's as simple as that.

2184,"The one deluding themselves by treating their and other similarly bitter people's rage-filled hatred as indisputable facts generally come from the fringes of the right. 

Crime in Italy has been dropping altogether, and [the criminality rate among foreigners living in Italy has dropped 65% from 2007 to 2016](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2018/03/03/has-immigration-really-led-to-an-increase-in-crime-in-italy/). 

The Italian statistical office even publishes data on [persons sentenced by geographic origin](http://dati.istat.it/Index.aspx?lang=en&amp;SubSessionId=6b126385-8043-405c-980b-1c2917ecca06). The site is messy to use, you have to switch between 'All countries of the world' and 'Foreign countries' filters, the difference between the two will be the number of Italian citizens sentenced by type of crime. 

If you do that, you get: 

Offences against life

 * All countries: 2930  
 * Foreign countries: 515  
 * Italian: 2930 - 515 = 2415  

Offences of sexual violence

 * All countries: 1693  
 * Foreign countries: 702  
 * Italian: 1693 - 702 = 991 

Elsewhere you can learn that [2/3 of prisoners in Italy are Italian](http://dati.istat.it/Index.aspx?lang=en&amp;SubSessionId=96c1f706-c500-4585-b375-987c44a814ac) (39.400 persons), a third are not (20.255).

2218,"The Spanish political system is one of the few remaining parliamentary monarchies in Europe, but the king does not have executive powers. The Parliament is bicameral and like many other countries in Europe such as Germany, Italy or France, there is a great preponderance of the Lower Chamber (Congreso de los Diputados) over the Upper Chamber (Senate).

On the electoral system, Spain applies the D'Hondt method that allocates seats through a proportional calculation that divides the total number of votes received by each party for the elected seats in each constituency. This system is also used in countries such as Austria or Belgium and favours the biggest parties and the less populated provinces, as fewer votes are needed in the calculation to win a seat.

Since this is not a direct attribution, the calculation is that to achieve a deputy in Soria (89,738 inhabitants) around 13,000 votes are enough, while the ""cheapest"" seat in Madrid (6.55 million inhabitants) requires 88,400 votes.

Overall, the 26 provinces with the fewest inhabitants have approximately 17.2% of the Spanish population but elect 29% of the deputies.

2261,"Racism is such a faulty means of evaluating the world.  Old school conservatism didn't even use it, having instead a concept of ""three generation influences"" that accounted for most racial differences in a manner prescient to modern science: what science now knows of as ""epigenetics"" was already a functioning part of conservative thought back in Ye Good Olde Days before people became so impatient that they started abandoning the contemplation of multigenerational influence models.

Many differences ascribed to race are the product of life stresses that replicate from one generation to the next.  The ill-favored races are *not coincidentally* born of societies that treat children poorly.  Of all the data that floats around the internet justifying racial hostilities, far and away the most honorable I have seen is a graph of child abuse rates as separated by race.  That graph illustrates what I believe is most central to the problem.  Well-treated children grow into adults who treat their children well, but humanity has hurried through a harrowing history of horrible hardships, and many are the generational traumas that afflict human epigenetics!  The ""better"" races are nothing less than the societies farther away from wretched, violent ancestries.  I use the phrase ""nothing less"" because that is wonderful itself, but I could just as well have said ""nothing more"", for it is a gain that can be replicated to the benefit of all.  Such a reconcilable problem justifies not racial supremacy, but only patience*.*

For you see, where our wisest ancestors would have spoken of the shadow cast upon a lineage by the sins of their ancestors, our current more scientific generation can use instead the model of epigenetics to explain why one generation of good treatment does not instantly resolve issues.  Instead, with *three* generations of good treatment, epigenetic damages should recede entirely, resulting in peaceful people who integrate well with modern societies.

Nor indeed have we need of abandoning all hope of swifter response by using this information; I intend no pure condemnation of impatience.  (Too many of the problems of humanity demand swift responses!)  For if people of this impatient generation preserve in mind not merely the facts of racial differences, but also the *causes of* the facts of racial differences, science will likely advance in ways that resolve those differences favorably.  As we master our biology epigenetic injuries may eventually be healable more swiftly.  We have begun to identify and resolve the genetic causes of suffering.  How long until we resolve also the injuries that may apply to the epigenome, and begin to craft therapies targeting those as well?",,/r/europe/comments/dvayoi/more_than_half_of_italians_in_poll_say_racism_is/f7bqbvl/,ShengjiYay,1573575197

Why do people who have limited understanding of something always boil things down to the lowest common denominator and do so with assumed authority? This isn't an insult. I am not insulting you.  I am pointing out that you do not have an understanding of plastic and what they are used for and simply made a nefarious assumption.

That said, no bag of peanuts has two different types of plastic on it, that would be cost prohibitive and silly.

&gt;Are we willing to invest in research and regulation and all that jazz or are we going to chase after the cheapest profits.

The company that produces and sells nuts does not develop plastics. Their business is nuts, not plastics. They buy (usually preprinted) rolls of plastic packaging from a company that produces said plastics like Coveris or an offshoot of BASF.  Plastics come in a variety of use cases. Strength, permeability, durability and more, each one with a specific use case. They need to have packaging that keeps their product fresh and protected and that is easily formed into the shapes and specifications they need. Not all plastics are the same. ""plastic"" is a generic term for 1000's of different chemical combinations that form everything from hair brushes to packaging. Plastics are in virtually everything you own.

Yes, the nut company buys the least expensive (of the limited) version of whatever fits their need. If they didn't, the other company selling peanuts would put them out of business because ""we"" are not willing to pay an extra dollar for that same package of nuts.  Its ""us"", not ""them"". In fact both companies will buy whatever is cheapest just so they can make sure that YOU do not buy the other guys peanuts.

The onus is on the plastics development and manufacturing companies to develop better and cheaper plastics, not the peanut seller.

As far as that greed and profit factor... This is what gets me annoyed the most.  There are way too many people who do not have a clue about the economy of scale when it comes to businesses. Apple makes 100's of dollars per phone, but that peanut company makes pennies per package (if that much). They do not buy the super duper biodegradable fungi packaging because each package would add 50 cents to the price and YOU wouldn't buy it anymore.

&gt;I've also heard about fungi based plastic alternatives

""fungi based plastic alternatives"" as a sweeping alternative is a misunderstanding of plastics.  As mentioned above (and something you can easily research) plastic is not a static thing, it is a chemical combination/soup that meets use case needs.   There are 1000's of varieties of plastic, unfortunately most do not have the right properties for a particular use case.

You can't just point a finger and say ""why aren't they using this fungi plastic?"" because it doesn't work that way.

Companies like Coveris and BASF are constantly researching and developing new packaging and plastics with a focus on sustainability.  The issue here is that you can't just throw money at something to solve a problem, it doesn't work like that. They have been developing new plastics for decades. ""We"" also have universities developing plastics, we are not living in a vacuum and that peanut maker would certainly use the plastic that is better for the environment so long as they can stay in business.

I guess it easier to just lump everything together and dissolve any personal responsibility to learn about the things one might be passionate or upset about, it makes us feel smarter, be able to slide the blame to the faceless and sleep better at night.

The next time you open a bag of peanuts, remember...you bought that bag of peanuts.",,/r/europe/comments/dv6ygy/some_drugstores_in_the_czech_republic_introduced/f7bfk2c/,ObiWanCanShowMe,1573567483

2326,"\&gt; I know that study that you tankies keep quoting read it more closely and see that soviet diet lacked quality and variety of the US and was primary based on more potatoes and cabbage than US it is obvious for anyone that knew what east block was.Tsarist Russia was rapidly industrializing before WW1 and it did that without murdering millions of its own people.

This is such a stupid counter-argument, now that you can't argue that the Soviets weren't starving, and at well, you want to criticize the Soviet government for not providing a diversified diet? How can you be this fucking stupid? And to say Tsarist Russia wasn't killing millions of its fucking people is absurd, the fucking Tsar engulfed the country into one of the brutal World Wars in modern history, killing over 40 million people.  How can you even make such a dumb ass statement?

\&gt; 90s were hars for Russia but they have surpassed soviet standard of life ages ago and nations occupied by the USSR are now at 3-5x the gdp/c of what they used to have in 1980s and the level of prosperity was unimaginable back in the old system.

Another dumbass argument - the USSR was dissolved, so there's no way to prove that the USSR would not provided a better quality of life than post capitalist Russia, and top of that, the majority of Russians want the USSR back. I would say that they would spit on your face for suggesting such a thing.

\&gt; USSR had plenty of unemployment it was hidden 

No, it wasn't? Unemployment, in the USSR, wasn't structural - it more so had to do with the fact that there simply people who couldn't work, people who had temporary switch jobs etc. That's not unemployment, in the traditional sense, because labor power was not a commodity in the USSR. People were guaranteed a job - something that isn't possible in capitalist societies because the bourgeois need an industrial reserve of labor to keep wages low as possible.

\&gt; .Homelessness was solved by sub diving apartments into smaller ones and mixing of all kinds of people together to ""promote worker unity""  

No, dude, a better solution would be having people be homeless, and clogging the streets up like they do in your shitty country.  You're absolutely right.

Russia also doesn't recognise its imperial genocides but I fail to see France recognising those genocides. It's less of a democratic regime as well. Same for the US and their crimes in Guatemala.

It has great universities that have done a lot of good for science, a working law and so on. Loosing Israel is loosing another part of this civilization. That's in general terms. If you argue with that then we have nothing to talk about and I'm leaving.

More strictly, in geopolitical terms, Israel for Europe is what the crusade kingdoms were for Europe in medieval times, it's blocking local empires from expanding to Europe. Now look what happened when the crusades failed. The Ottomans stopped long way ahead, by the Vienna walls. Yes, today it would strengthen Turkey a really lot which would enable Turkey to hold grip on south-eastern countries of Europe, Balkans, Greece, Bulgaria and maybe even Hungary. Turkey is aggressively expanding economically in that region right now, this process would only fastened if there was nobody to balance Turkey from the south.

Another reason is that US isn't interested in keeping the Hormuz strait at peace anymore. Since 2017 they're self-reliant when it comes to oil/gas use, even more, they've become an exporter. What that means is that US will gradually withdraw from ME because the reason why US was present there isn't 'lobbying' but securing and stabilizing oil prices. There's no reason to do that anymore. What that means for Europe is that it will need to start taking responsibility for the ME region for it's own sake.

&gt;	Yes. Do you even fathom how much land they owned? That land had been forcefully taken from Estonians and Latvians after the crusades when the entire native population was forced into centuries of serfdom.

Yes, there were large estates that were mostly revoked and destroyed in Latvia during 1917 &amp; 1918, which left only either Germans without land or those who owned smaller plots, those were revoked too. And this “forced centuries of serfdom” is classic and always makes me cringe, one peek at the history of Baltic region will show you this is hardly the case, maybe only after 17th century when Russian empire really implemented a real serfrom but them that has nothing to do with the Crusades.

If that would be the case the rest doesn't matter anyway. 

But as Always some anti-German hate is Always good. Especially People that didn't read or know of the German Weißbuch (White book a book About the Outlook on foreign Policy and armed Forces) or anything About German politics.

The only Argument is probably NS2 which isn't even a German Project or has Government Money in it, or Schröder which is a persona non Grata in Germany and his Party is going below 10% probably. And probably Ukraine, which is a Country, we don't border, isn't in EU or NATO and don't even have any remarkable ties, other than being on the same continent. We also didn't Moldavia/Transnistiren, Georgia conflict.

Germany didn't just add Poland annuly defense Budget on top of theirs the last 5 years for shit and giggles. We not increasing our to tanks to ca 320 and maybe 400(80 for reserve purposes to have 100% availbility, been through the defense commity, but must also go through other commities), because Switzerland seems threating.

And the deepening cooperation between Poland and Germany, are because of the common enemy czechia or what.

But whoever read into it properly knows that Norway was taken quite easily and with fairly minor losses except the sinking of Blücher. We put alot of pride in how many people was part of the resistance (while it was a fair amount of the ''resistance fighters'' who just told people they were.) And we kind of ignored how terribly we treated our fellow Norwegians after the war. (Especially the women who fraternized with germans, and their children. It's quite a horrible story honestly.) Lastly we had a large part of our population fighting in the war against the soviets on the side of the Germans. When the survivors came back home they were mostly ignored, and they just denied doing any warcrime. Solidifying the ''clean'' part of Norway in the world war.

That's quite xenophobic.

What you may take into account that there exists a rather strong stereotype in Estonia that Latvian education system barely mentions the Estonian forces activities during the Latvian War of Independence. Hence their arguments here, which have not been correct. I however have been correct throughout this topic and I don't take lightly your ethnic based biases.

&gt;Just because you have an Estonian flair doesn’t make the best source of information.

Yet it more or less does on our own history at least.

&gt;And this “forced centuries of serfdom” is classic and always makes me cringe

Honestly, I have never felt so sick before talking with anyone from the Baltics. Your twisted perception of our history is honestly revolting.

&gt;maybe only after 17th century when Russian empire really implemented a real serfrom but them that has nothing to do with the Crusades.

2776,"&gt; Lol, Turkey also said they were **sorry.**

No it absolutely didn’t. Don’t promote misinformation. 

Again you are completely missing the point, the debate here which the article brings to light is about degrees of facing history and not only about full on recognitions:

&gt; Turkey’s rejection of the genocide label is only part of the problem. A bigger worry is its refusal to accept any responsibility for what happened. For successive governments, condemnation of the events of 1915, whether as genocide, a war crime or ethnic cleansing, has been out of the question. The past has been sanitised.

Most of those states you mention have either done *something*, no matter how limited with respect to their own internal history, but more importantly they do not engage in such a monumental state denial as the Turkish making it part and parcel of the state ideology traditionally rooted in attempting to tie the Turkish identity to said denial. Unlike the rest, the Turkish state neurotically exerts tight control of the narrative of this history in Turkey and exerts all its efforts to export it. Turkey doesn’t thane free press and it’s liberal academic inteligencia has recently either fled the country or is suppressed.

No, Russians are not worse. These issues are not politicized identities of the people, nor that there is any homogeneity in Russian identity to begin with. Same applies for Americans. Europeans and others. Moreover Russia has recognized that at least the Soviet Union has committed genocide. Equally the US is not even comparable to Turkey on this. 

The Genocide itself was a political tool, the reason, justifications and motives behind the Genocide were political, it’s denial since day 1 itself was a political tool, the backing Turkey got to deny and hide it was a political tool itself, hell everything about the genocide was political from the Turkish side, and yet for some reason all of that is not deemed to be a political matter by the deniers.

Around 14th century German Teutonic knights conquered it by trick and began germanazing the city, then Poland took it back and lost it again to Prussia during partitions in 18th century and then full blown germanization started. After end of ww1 Gdańsk was given status of free city. It population was around 90% German then, but strategically and economically it was very important to Poland, so Poland was given economical control over the city port.

&gt; A natural monopoly is a monopoly in an industry in which high infrastructural costs and other barriers to entry relative to the size of the market give the largest supplier in an industry, often the first supplier in a market, an overwhelming advantage over potential competitors. This frequently occurs in industries where capital costs predominate, creating economies of scale that are large in relation to the size of the market; examples include public utilities such as water services and electricity.[1] Natural monopolies were recognized as potential sources of market failure early as the 19th century; John Stuart Mill advocated government regulation to make them serve the public good.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dupdvw/xi_jinping_visits_greece_eyeing_deeper_ties/f7ao74k/,duisThias,1573534553

2845,"Maybe, but you'll thus have the current situation where Eastern Europe is extremely Pro-American and distrustful of the West at the same time that the opposite is occuring in the West. I'm not exactly sure if that's a good long-term strategy for your country.

First, I hope you understand that the current world order more or less favours you Americans, right? You are in a less secure position than two decades ago, the pivot to use NATO in the Middle East has failed, but still.

Taking the view of someone who hypothetically only cares for the US, let me explain:

The simplest problem is that the West may just decide the US will take care of the East anyway, so why even bother with NATO and leave, which means the US will have to defend all the same, except with more difficulties and carrying even more of a burden. Because, to get into the mindset of the completely callous (which I disagree with), the Russians have to go through the East anyway to get to the West (which many doubt they will). The US encouraged the Eastern Enlargement for a reason, remember that.

First, let me make it clear I'm against the normalization of relations with Russia, I am well aware of how they treated the Crimean Tatar. However, some Europeans feel that they've been driven into conflict with Russia and one of the only things that keeps the West committed against Russia is values (which increasingly mean nothing in politics, we're seeing a return of a certain political nihilism with the popularization of lies and importance of ruthless self-interest. America first, France first, Britain first and ectera. Seems there's still some capacity for you lot to propagate your ideas) and Eastern Europe. I don't agree with it, but the ties between the East and the West (or at least Hungary and Poland) are becoming increasingly frayed. 

Obama was against Brexit for a good reason, the UK kept things at a status quo and gave the US leverage in the EU. Trump actively attacking the EU seems to have awoken some urgency in policy makers and all these events happening at once means that the EU will either start to unify in a course which is quite likely to not be too close to the US, splinter apart with in spectacular fashion (in which case I don't relish how vultures will react), or have both happen at once with a West unifying on it's own and an abandoned East.

With the UK leaving, American influence receding and Germany defensive and confused, there are no pro-expansion forces in the EU. Do you understand?Without the values and the East, there's no obstacles to normalize relations.

That's a worst case scenario. If the West doesn't succeed in their European project, and they feel letdown they may turn elsewhere, which reading some state department papers biggest fears are either China or Russia. Despite some American threats that the US will just leave and let the ""Europeans get invaded"", your involvement isn't charity. A Russia that manages to get an entente with Western Europe is a threat. In what is likely to be the economic confusion following Brexit the situation might degenerate and it's quite possible the US will ""lose"" the continent in the worst case scenario.

It's why the report from the State department a few weeks ago was for reversing Trumpism to reassert the US in the West (to the protest of some who saw US meddling to protect it's interests, which I believe is true). Trump does press some wants such as ""reasserting control"", but he misses the forest for the trees. He's not only a corrupt, repulsive, scumbag, he actively seems to sabotage the US's own long-term interests and method of control.

Merkel with all her faults understand how this little project of decoupling from the US could go horribly wrong, which is why the German strategy seems to be to do nothing and hope that the Anglophone countries return to their senses.
It's a shame you Americans and Brits targeted the Germans. 

I don't want the EU to be a puppet, but it's either unify, hope Trump doesn't get a second term and that no one who's worse gets elected, or accept being a pawn for less friendly regimes.",France,/r/europe/comments/duz6l8/poland_says_frances_macron_comments_on_nato/f7aoutx/,frissio,1573535089

2969,"The percentages of this particular poll seem odd in a number of ways, even though there's a grain of truth to some of the results from my perspective, such as that many Israelis see the European Union ( Note, not necessarily specific member states ) in a negative light due to the fact it has been at the forefront of criticism and BDS support ( In countries like Ireland, UK, Sweden, etc. ) and certain UN votes lately, in addition to clashes on unrelated topics with countries like Poland and so forth.

Things then start getting a bit peculiar though - most Israelis wanting to improve relations with Turkey, while Erdogan's leadership is one of the most despised by Israelis and Turkey being one of the greatest adversaries in rhetoric to Israel? Maybe they meant with the Turkish people specifically, but this question isn't clarified even in the [original document](https://www.mitvim.org.il/images/English_Report_-_The_2019_Israeli_Foreign_Policy_Index_of_the_Mitvim_Institute.docx.pdf).

Then we have the figure that 27% of Israelis thinks Israel belongs to Europe versus the 'Mediterranean basin' or the Middle-east. What the hell does that mean? I'm sure most outsiders will think ""Oh, a portion of Israelis are just ignorant dumbasses like that"", but anyone who is more familiar with the situation knows that it almost never manifests *that way*. Most Israelis are not even Ashkenazi Jews, and geographical knowledge is obtained just from the fact that newspaper and broadcasts show regional threats like every single Thursday, all the wars, etc. There are pretty much 0 Israelis who don't know which continent they're in, so I can only imagine that they were asking culturally perhaps. But the poll never says 'culturally', in fact it makes it sound very much like a geographical question.

Russia and the US followed by Germany and Britain being the most important ( as individual states ) makes more sense, but there are some oddities. The number of respondents is 700, which is okay, but there's always a self-selection bias which makes me think that percentages could potentially shift somewhat, just as a minor quip.

Lastly, the poll was, according to the paper - ""carried out by the Rafi Smith Institute and in cooperation with Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung,among a representative sample of Israel’s adult population (700men and women, Jews and Arabs)"", which means that up to 20% of respondents could be Israeli-Arabs for a representative sample of the population, so a lot of people might want to take that into account before going on rants related to gripes they exclusive have with Israeli Jews in regards to what influences percentages.",Israel,/r/europe/comments/dusy3e/almost_45_of_israelis_consider_eu_as_opponent/f7aen8f/,Pingerim,1573527353

&gt;The GOP’s plan: prevent voters from voting
By Michael A. Cohen Columnist,April 26, 2019, 5:04 p.m
LAST NOVEMBER, REPUBLICANS lost 40 seats in the House of Representatives, nearly 300 seats in state legislatures, seven governorships, and suffered the worst defeat in the congressional popular vote since 1974.
Now the GOP has come up with a strategy to reverse these losses: change the rules. Five months after being trounced at the polls, Republican legislators across the country are not trying to convince voters to support them; rather, they’re passing legislation that will make it more difficult to unseat them.
In Tennessee, the Republican-controlled legislature will soon vote on a bill that would impose civil penalties for sending in incomplete registration forms, and criminal penalties for voter-drive organizations that fail to turn in voter registration forms within 10 days or have its volunteers attend mandatory training sessions. Tennessee already has one of the lowest voting participation rates in the country, so why make it more difficult to register new voters? In 2018, nearly 90,000 new black voters — who primarily vote Democratic — registered in the state. Even though Republicans won big in Tennessee last November, they aren’t taking any chances.
In Texas, where Democrats in 2018 picked up a dozen seats in the House, flipped two congressional seats, and almost won a Senate race for the first time in three decades, Republicans are following the same course. A bill recently approved by the State Senate would make it a felony to provide false information on a voter registration form. This means that a typo could, in effect, result in jail time. The legislation in Texas would even make it a crime to use a provisional ballot, which is typically done in situations when voters aren’t sure they are eligible to vote.
In Arizona, a bill is being considered that would make it more difficult for state residents to vote early.
Some Republican legislators are even undoing the will of their own citizens. Last November in Florida, voters overwhelmingly supported an amendment to the state constitution that would re-enfranchise convicted felons. Now Republicans in the state legislature are working on bills requiring convicted felons pay off their financial obligations to regain their right to vote. Critics have called this legislation the modern equivalent of a poll tax because it is aimed at restricting the right to vote for predominately minority black voters. 

This is an American newspaper anyway and New York Times and Washington Post seem to have similar articles, especially about the ""2020 Trump Census Question"". It's the American left that says this, so it's not just foreigners.

Whether it's a problem? That's for the American experts and citizens to decide.",France,/r/europe/comments/dusy3e/almost_45_of_israelis_consider_eu_as_opponent/f7ags5c/,frissio,1573528893

Unfortunately, it works very well with the so-called boomer generation, which constitutes a huge share of the national electorate in Poland.

3028,"&gt; You claimed in your original post that 9/11 ""came out of Bosnia"" and the only evidence of it is that certain Al-Qaeda operatives were present in Bosnia years before the attack.

It's not just the hijackers that were Bosnian mujahideen. All levels of Al-Qaeda were present in Bosnia where they could run planning, funding, training and recruitment of operatives among thousands of mujahideen with impunity. Is your claim that they could do that in Bosnia and not in Hungary simply because Bosnian government was unaware that it was happening? How is that supposed to soothe the security concerns over Bosnia becoming an EU member, the very point that Macron made?

&gt;Also arrested as part of the criminal ring was a Catholic Croat called Nikola Grubesa but I don't see you, or anyone for that matter, claiming that Croatia and Croats were 'involved in the Bataclan attack'.

His arrest wasn't related to the Bataclan attack. Avaz's DNA was found on the weapons in the Bataclan attack.

&gt;The man is a drug dealer and arms trafficker who simply happens to be of Bosnian descent, nothing else. So I have no idea why you're even bringing it up or what relevance it has to this topic

3112,"&gt;He's a Bosnian national from Zenica who was arrested in Germany. How does the fact the he was in Germany for a while imply that his situation has ""nothing to do with living in Bosnia""?

You claimed that 'Bosnian Muslims' took part in the Bataclan attack. First of all, that quantifier implies that numerous Bosnian Muslim individuals took part in the terrorist attack, which is false and deliberately misleading Serbian propaganda. One man, who is a member of an organized criminal ring, is **suspected** of selling a weapon, as an arms dealer, which was later used in the attack. He did not personally take part in the attack and he is not a foreign ISIL fighter. So for you to claim that Bosnian Muslims were part of the Bataclan attack is false and also malicious, but that is your intent in the first place anyway.

&gt;And you need to follow the conversation better. I never claimed that he was a returning jihadi. Islamic terrorism is not limited to returning jihadis, they are just a small part of it, so that's another spurious qualifier that we needn't apply.

Macron was personally talking about returning Islamist fighters. Perhaps you should read the context of his statements before jumping on the first opportunity to spew nationalist lies.

&gt;The Izetbegović dynasty has very deep ties with both the perpetrators and planners of 9/11 attacks, going to the highest level. 

That has never been proven on any level, mostly a narrative pushed by Serbian tabloid newspapers and their followers. 

The 600-page 9/11 Commission Report prepared by the U. S. government does not implicate or blame Bosnia or Bosnian Muslims at any single point, no Bosnian took part in the 9/11 attacks. Judging by your ridiculous comment an innocent observer could assume that Bosnians were flying the planes used in the attacks.",Bosnia and Herzegovina,/r/europe/comments/dutg94/france_is_the_ticking_time_bomb_not_bosnia/f79mx4z/,baci_napolje,1573510004

3116,"&gt; Scores of protesters cut off a major highway at the French-Spanish border on Monday, stopping traffic moving in both directions.

&gt; Some 80 people blocked the road at La Jonquera on both the French and Spanish sides — after a call to gather there by campaign group Democratic Tsunami. 

&gt; The group said it was seeking to bring an international focus to cause of Catalan independence.

&gt; ""Today we start a new way of protest, using technology to defend rights and collective freedom, instead of repression and control,"" said one tweet, posted in English.

&gt; Democratic Tsunami was responsible for several protests last month, including one that caused disruption to road and air traffic at Barcelona airport.

&gt; That protest followed the jailing of several Catalan politicians for their part in an effort to declare independence from the Spanish state.

&gt; The latest protest came a day after Spain held a general election that saw Pedro Sanchez's Socialists emerge as the biggest party — on 120 seats — but short of a majority and struggling to make up the numbers with a progressive coalition.

&gt; The big winner on the day was the far-right Vox party, which became the third largest force in parliament winning five seats.

3320,"""A trained economist, Salazar entered public life with the support of President Óscar Carmona after the Portuguese coup d'état of 28 May 1926, initially as finance minister and later as prime minister. Opposed to democracy, communism, socialism, anarchism and liberalism, Salazar's rule was conservative and nationalist in nature. Salazar distanced himself from fascism and Nazism, which he criticized as a ""pagan Caesarism"" that recognised neither legal nor moral limits.[1] Salazar promoted Catholicism, but argued that the role of the Church was social, not political, and negotiated the Concordat of 1940. One of the mottos of the Salazar regime was ""Deus, Pátria e Família"" (meaning ""God, Fatherland, and Family"").[2]""

""The Estado Novo has been described by the American socialist author David L. Raby as a far-right leaning regime of para-fascist inspiration, although general labeling of Portugal as fascist declined after the defeat of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in World War II.[46] The corporatist state had some similarities to Benito Mussolini's Italian fascism, but considerable differences in its moral approach to governing.[47] Although Salazar admired Mussolini and was influenced by his Labour Charter of 1927,[32] he distanced himself from fascist dictatorship, which he considered a pagan Caesarist political system that recognised neither legal nor moral limits. Salazar also viewed German Nazism as espousing pagan elements that he considered repugnant. ""

3338,"&gt; Obviously every single country is trying to arrest and prosecute the jihadists,

As I can see in the media, a lot of European countries would like to just leave them in Syrian prisons and not deal with them in their countries.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the question is how many sneak through?

None. As I said there wasn't a single incident with any of the ISIS returnees in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Adding to that - there was never an ISIS related terrorist attack in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are warrants issued for everyone who went to fight in Syria, and those warrants are handled through Interpol. When they are found, they are extradited to our country, arrested, they have a trial and go to prison.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; and I'm still not sure what Macron was referring to. 

He was pretty clear: ""If you’re concerned about this region, the first question is neither  North Macedonia nor Albania, it’s Bosnia-Herzegovina, the time-bomb  that’s ticking right next to Croatia, and which faces the problem of returning jihadists"".

And that's the topic I'm talking about.

3342,"&gt; Prewar evils such as irredentism and anti-Semitism are alive in mainstream politics to a degree they are not on the other side of the former Iron Curtain. Just ask emigre Hungarian Jewish financier George Soros, whom Orban cast as his leading opponent in the last national election. 

Sorry friend, but times have changed and roles have reversed. For example from last years [European Jewish Community Leaders survey](http://www.jdc-iccd.org/publications/fourth-european-jewish-leaders-survey-2018/):

&gt;""almost one in four in the West (24%) felt unsafe in their city in contrast to only 4% of those in the East. This regional variation is noteworthy and has historical significance for Jews in Europe. It is a reversal of the situation whereby over the past two centuries the “West” was regarded as more welcoming and safer for Jews than the “East.” ""

Its not in EE, where synagogues are getting firebombed or Jews are warned its dangerous to wear a kippah in public. 

Its ridiculous how Soros always is brought up as an example of anti-Semitism. Is Orban criticizing him for being a Jew or for what Soros does (supposedly does)/says?

&gt; Poland moved to make its government-owned network independent, similar to the BBC. That abruptly ended when the right-wing Law and Justice party came to power in 2015.  

This perfectly shows that the author is either dishonest or simply has no clue what they are talking about... Public media have always had a pro-gov bias, PiS did dial up the propaganda to 11, but that doesnt change the simple fact that they never were independent.

&gt;Poland’s passage of a law criminalizing accounts of the Holocaust that hold Poles accountable is the quintessential example.

3362,"&gt;It's the people like you going around spreading propaganda about how Serbia is a genocidal country

To be fair, how many countries got their president dragged to the Hague for war crimes in the past 50 years?

&gt;when Serbia never committed genocide. 

Even if you use the phrase ""ethnic cleansing"" that still won't make it better. Genocide or ethnic cleansing are both equally bad. In fact, ethnic cleansing preceedes genocides, so we could argue that the only reason why Serbs didn't upgrade their ethnic cleansing to genocides is because they run out of time due to the war ending without them achieving their objective of ""Greater Serbia"". I think it's undeniable that the creation of ""Greater Serbia"" would be achieved only through genocide.

&gt;Not in Kosovo

Again, the ICTY ruled that Serbia committed mass rapes and massacres, along with the systematic destruction of mosques and other Albanian architecture. Just because you were stopped by NATO bombing doesn't mean that the Serbs weren't in the process of starting a genocide of Albanians.

&gt;not in Srebrenica (Bosnian Serbs, not Serbia, before you get upset, there's a court decision so there's that).

Yeah, but The International Court of Justice also concluded that Serbia failed to prevent genocide committed by Bosnian Serb forces and failed to punish those responsible, and bring them to justice. Serbia could have stopped the Bosnian Serbs at any time, but instead chose to look the other way.

3499,"While it's true the growth of Madrid and Barcelona has been massive, has it been cause or effect? Its actually been a cause of multinationals settling onto a country, which happened to choose its capital, and then brought value onto there. This caused a massive wealth and job creation, which in turn reinforced the immigration to Madrid.

Its a wheel, influenced by globalisation, but as time goes on, it's proven again that complete centralisation is an error of caps, invisible walls that reduce growth or simply generate problems.

I'm reality, massive centralisation is good for a kick-start, but decentralisation is promptly needed to evade problems of scale, but can't be fully achieved without prior centralisation.

And the wheel goes on. Think of a funny metaphor, systems of all kinds usually follow a pattern found in biology, and cell reproduction via mitothis mitosis. 

Cells feed and grow until they are big enough to split, and from one system two emerge. The same has happened with civilizations, we have grown tall until there's been trouble associated with lack of space, and then settled new lands.

While it's true that technology has morphed some biological concepts, nature is wise and the mitosis of cells have occurred for millenia.",Andalusia (Spain),/r/europe/comments/duejfh/spanish_general_elections_megathread/f78acvw/,Alxe,1573489112

If way more women are open about their non-heterosexual sexuality, that'll obviously lead to the impression that way more women are gay/bi, regardless of the facts.

That's why I wonder what's actually fact and what's just impressions caused by societal pressures and acceptance. It *could* obviously be a biological difference, it *could* be societal pressures leading to most men hiding it *or* it could be a mix of both. I'm not sure how you'd ever find out though, as you'd always rely on self-reporting which would obviously always be impacted by societal acceptance.

The GUI is fine. Standard users are fine if they do ordinary stuff, power users are fine since they can figure things out themselves. It's the intermediate use where you occasionally end up googling the right fix for an hour where the problem lies. Then again, some of these things plainly aren't possible in Windows, or behind mile high paywalls.

3590,"Douaumont ossuary (French: L'ossuaire de Douaumont) is a memorial containing the skeletal remains of soldiers who died on the battlefield during the Battle of Verdun in World War I. It is located in Douaumont, France, within the Verdun battlefield.

During the 300 days of the Battle of Verdun (21 February 1916 – 19 December 1916) approximately 230,000 men died out of a total of 700,000 casualties (dead, wounded and missing). The battle became known in German as Die Hölle von Verdun (English: The Hell of Verdun), or in French as L'Enfer de Verdun, and was conducted on a battlefield covering less than 20 square kilometers (7.7 sq mi). 

The battle lasted for 303 days, the longest and one of the most costly in human history. In 2000, Hannes Heer and K. Naumann calculated that the French suffered 377,231 casualties and the Germans 337,000, a total of 714,231 and an average of 70,000 a month. In 2014, William Philpott wrote of 976,000 casualties in 1916 and 1,250,000 suffered around the city during the war. In France, the battle came to symbolise the determination of the French Army and the destructiveness of the war.",,/r/europe/comments/dusyab/the_douaumont_ossuary_in_memory_of_the_soldiers/f780w2j/,Ceredigiondragon,1573482198

I'm not saying it didn't happen - but even if it did, it doesnt really say that they weren't prepared to shift off the military solution. If you look at the closest comparison - the peace process in northern Ireland, the IRA was almost certainly ding exactly the same thing. Preparing to be able to fight is not the same as being determined to fight. 

It's also important to realize that both sides had a spread of opinions they were having to deal with. Just as Erdogan had to keep his own hawks somewhat onboard, the Kurdish leadership had to deal with those on their side who didn't trust Turkey to follow through.

It was the best chance for a real peace in decades - and without the syrian civil war and ISIS might well have actually worked. Erdogna worked damn hard to push the peace deal as far as it got and the PKK ceasefire was a huge result. The problem was that there was too much outside pressure on the fragile peace and not enough time for much trust to have built up. It wasn't really either Turkey or the PKK's fault it broke down.

Some people blame Erdogan for not supporting the Kurds when the battle of Kobane was happening but personally I think he would probably have lost power to more hawkish elements of the Turkish government if he had done so.

3823,"“**What is 11 November in Latvia?**

The Lāčplēsis Day is marked on the calendar as a commemoration day when tribute is paid to those who fought for Latvia’s freedom. Lāčplēsis (Bearslayer), a legendary character from the Latvian national epic, has been depicted in literary works and films, and symbolises the greatness of the nation. His heroic deeds symbolise human bravery in defending one’s homeland from the aggressor.

The state of Latvia was proclaimed on 18 November 1918. Its existence, however, had to be defended against the supporters of former German and Russian empires and the Red Army of the Soviet Russia. This military conflict was later named the Latvian War of Independence.

On 11 November 1919 in Riga, the Latvian Army overwhelmed the German and Russian White Guard troops under Bermont’s command and freed the left bank of the River Daugava. The victory over the Bermontian army made it possible for Latvia’s newly established independence and statehood to take root and survive. This is a symbolic date reminiscent of people who stood united as they fiercely engaged with a well-armed enemy which had advantage in numbers – and won against the odds. On 11 November, Latvia honours those who, in a crucial moment, selflessly gave their lives so that the Latvian state can live.

Therefore, this day has become the epitome of Latvian soldiers’ victory in the War of Independence and presents a suitable occasion when to commemorate all Latvian freedom fighters who fought in all wars.

Other Western countries also mark 11 November, but in relation to another event a year earlier – the signing of the Armistice of Compiègne on 11 November 1918, which meant the end of World War I.

**Outline of the historic events of 11 November**

After defeat in the Battle of Cēsis in June 1919, in accordance with the Ceasefire of Strazdumuiža signed on 3 July, German troops were ordered to leave Latvia in the shortest time possible. Nevertheless, German general Rüdiger von der Goltz had no intention to abide by this demand. His German troops merged with the forces led by a Russian general Pavel Bermont-Avalov to form the West Russian Volunteer Army, which launched an attack on Riga on 8 October at dawn.   

Three army corps under Bermont’s leadership advanced rapidly on the Latvian capital. Despite resistance put up by the Latvian troops, the assaults of the West Russian Volunteer Army forced Latvians to retreat across the River Daugava. A stream of refugees flowed towards Jugla in the outskirts of Riga. On 10 October the fate of Riga and that of entire Latvia “hang by a thread”, as the papers wrote at the time. Still, the Latvian army fought back fiercely that day, and managed to halt the enemy’s advances by the bridges over the Daugava.

On 15 October in the morning, a group of about 100 volunteers launched a mock attack from the right bank of the Daugava across the Iron Bridge to Pārdaugava. Their mission was to divert the adversary’s attention from Daugavgrīva – the direction of the main attack. Earlier, as they were marching through the streets of Riga to the bankside, the troops sang Div’dūjiņas (Two Doves Soared High), a folksong about soldiers bidding farewell to their loved ones before going to battle. They felt that many of them will never return. This episode – the attack across the Iron Bridge – was later immortalised by sculptor Kārlis Zāle in a bas-relief on the Freedom Monument.

The same day saw the main offensive of the Latvian Army, supported by gunfire from British and French warships. The ships of these Entente powers were intensively shelling the districts of Daugavgrīva and Bolderāja and the rear of the Bermontian positions.  The allies came to Latvia’s assistance at the moment when they had made sure that the Latvian army will be able to put up and continue a successful defence.  Bolderāja had to be retaken by sending a landing force across the Daugava so that the attack could be continued from that location. Sustaining insignificant losses, Latvian troops captured targets of strategic importance – the Daugavgrīva Fortress and Bolderāja. The Latvian Army seized the initiative, and the whole Latgale Division moved to the left bank of the Daugava on 16 October.

On 11 November 1919 in Riga, the Latvian army defeated the German and Russian White Guard troops under Bermont’s command. Up till the end of November – beginning of December, Latvian troops were driving the enemy out of Latvia.  The victory over the Bermontian army made it possible for Latvia’s newly established independence and statehood to take root and survive. The defeat of Bermont’s troops enabled the Latvian government in 1920 to focus on fighting against the Red Army in the eastern front and successfully complete the liberation of Latvia’s entire territory from foreign invaders.

In the wake of the victory, 11 November was named “The Lāčplēsis Day”. In 1920, the Lāčplēsis Military Order was established, to be awarded for valour in combat during the Latvian War of Independence. Following Latvia’s occupation and the loss of its national independence in 1940, the celebration of the Lāčplēsis Day was banned. After Latvia’s statehood was re-established, the Lāčplēsis Day was declared a commemoration day by a law of 3 October 1990.

Also, considering Russia invaded and violated Ukrainian borders in Crimea, wouldn't you say it's not unreasonable to restrict access lest another incursion would this time happen from Crimea? In addition to all the resenment that the annexation has caused creating turmoil in the area.

Interesting that Russia did not make a concerted effort to make Ukraine cede Crimea when they had a pro-Russian government in Ukraine that would've been far more receptive.

“But it was. It was you Germans who did the holocaust, it was you who murdered the Jews and it was you who pushed them.”
I did jack shit i wasn’t even born but yeah our forefathers murdered several million people using everything from language to gaschambers, since then we kinda know exactly what qualifies as nazi propaganda but hey sure i should ask other people from foreign countries on the meaning of our words and how they have benn used and how they still are used, makes sense.

I brought up Estonia because that's where I live and it serves as an illustration on how Russia consistently treats Russians abroad. But I guess I'm just butthurt because I'm concerned with how Russians are doing in my country and other countries.

I'm sure the people living in Eastern Ukraine are sleeping soundly now that they're living in dictatorships run by run-of-the-mill goons. Russians living elsewhere in Ukraine must be terrified that they're not afforded that privilege. Also, while Russia loves to fearmonger on behalf of the monsters it has created or empowered, I'm feeling rather underwhelmed by what those monsters have achieved.

3963,"&gt;In 2018, employment rates for men and women aged 55 to 64 years were higher, at 65% for men and 52% for women, than the average rates for all adult men and women (60% and 48%) in the  European Union (EU).  
&gt;  
&gt;The most striking aspect is the rapid pace at which employment rates for people aged 55 to 64 years increased between 2003 and 2018 (with little or no  impact from the global financial and economic crisis). This was particularly notable in relation to the growing proportion of women in  work.   
&gt;  
&gt;Between 2003 and 2018, the employment  rates for this age group increased in all EU Member States except Greece. In Slovenia and Bulgaria, the employment rate for people aged 55 to 64 years doubled in this period, and it rose at an even faster pace  in Slovakia (2.2 times as high).  
&gt;  
&gt;In  2018, employment rates among people aged 55 to 64 years were more than  70% in Sweden, Germany and Denmark. In contrast, there were seven EU Member States — Malta, Poland, Slovenia, Romania, Croatia, Greece and  Luxembourg — where rates for this age group were less than 50%.   
&gt;  
&gt;One way to try to increase financial security in old-age is to work longer. Older people who delay their  retirement earn more money, accumulate additional pension rights and may  be able to save some of the earnings or divert them to a private pension plan.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although low, a growing share of the EU‑28 population aged 65 to 74 years continued to  work. In 2018, more than one quarter (26%) of this age group in Estonia were employed, while rates above 15% were recorded in Romania, Lithuania, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden and Latvia.",,/r/europe/comments/duol4p/people_work_more_years_before_retirement_eu/f77g4mc/,Jarijari7,1573455138

4021,"It’s not really about the candidates themselves, but the parties that support them. Both are very sinister IMO. 

**Dan Barna** - completely unremarkable character who became leader of the USR party after an electronic vote conducted using software that was developed for the greek elections and then abandoned after the Greek parliament decided it was too insecure. That software hasn’t been updated in years when the USR used it for their internal elections and could have easily been hacked by even a mediocre hacker. 

Nevertheless, the USR (Save Romania Union) is a relatively new party that started off on an anticorruption platform back in 2014-2015 when the DNA was purging corrupt officials and desperate scumbag MPs from the mainstream parties (mostly PSD) were trying to pass laws to disband or at least castrate the DNA (which they eventually managed to do). However, as soon as the party started to gain popularity and spotlight from the media, it became more and more clear that its members, especially those in leadership roles, weren’t as clean as they like people to think. For example, one prominent USR MP is Claudiu Nasui, a spoiled kid whose family became rich after embezzling the Romanian state of around $6 million together with the infamous general and defense minister Victor Atanasie Stanculescu who was convicted in 2008 for giving the order to shoot protesters during the 1989 revolution. Roxana Wring, who was recently found to have colaborated with the secret police early in her career is another example. Dan Barna himself is another good example of a si sinister background - he is fairly wealthy (over €1 million) and describes himself as an “entrepreneur” despite his portfolio consisting almost exclusively of failed businesses financed with state or EU money. How one becomes a millionaire by starting businesses with public funds and driving them into the ground is a secret that I’d very much like to know too. 

Mircea Diaconu - former actor that got involved with politics later in life. He is even more sinister than Barna. Not as a person, he is nothing but a puppet for those who stand behind him, but as a candidate. He is supported by PRO Romania and ALDE. PRO Romania is a party formed by a group of PSD members who got kicked out of the party after Liviu Dragnea aka “Daddy” decided he wanted to become the Erdogan of Romania (fortunately his evil plan didn’t work out that well and ended up with him in a smelly prison cell). The leader of the party is Victor Ponta aka “Mickey Mouse”. Just like Daddy, Mickey Mouse had dictatorial tendencies, inherited from his mentor Adrian Nastase aka “Candy boy” and showed off during his term as PM between 2012 and 2015, so that’s why he quickly got booted shortly after his government collapsed and Daddy took on the opportunity to take over. ALDE is the other party, led by Calin Popescu Tariceanu, another sinister character. Romanian PM between 2005 and 2008, is among the top 500 richest Romanians, supposedly earning his fortune by selling imported cars and Harley Davidson motorcycles, is one of the prime examples of corrupt politicians being shielded from justice by parliament. His party was in an alliance with the PSD for a long time but jumped ship soon after Daddy went to prison. At this point, I would say Tariceanu’s main priority is to stay out of prison, which makes him extremely dangerous as a politician, in case he gets any sort of power, as Daddy previously proved, that he was ready to fuck up the country by releasing murderers and rapists just so that he can avoid going to prison.",,/r/europe/comments/du0i14/romanian_presidential_elections_first_round/f77841f/,crocodilau,1573446663

A devolved unitary country happens whenever a national parliament or government decide that some powers are better exercised at a more local level, and therefore enable some lower entity (region, district, whatever) to make their own laws on some specific topics. In this second case the national legislature has the exclusive power to rule on everything else, and above all still retains the power to withdraw whatever power they devolved to any subnational entities.

4077,"On the night after the Berlin Wall fell, as I watched crowds of delirious East Germans surge down West Berlin’s broad Kurfürstendamm street, it didn’t occur to me that history was ending. On the contrary, it seemed that in the former captive nations of Eastern Europe, history was making a comeback.

Soviet-imposed communism, I wrote that night in an article for The Post, had suppressed the politics that drove events in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and other East Bloc states before World War II. As the wall fell, those currents were suddenly reappearing, as if awakened from a long sleep. Poland’s Solidarity movement was splintering into liberal and nationalist factions that resembled prewar parties. In Yugoslavia, ethnic animosities between Serbs and Croats were resurfacing. Hungary had rediscovered its prewar nationalism in a feud with Romania.

Thirty years later, the politics of the 1930s are still playing out in the former Eastern Bloc. Poland is governed by an authoritarian-minded right-wing government closely aligned with a reactionary Catholic Church. An uneasy peace prevails in the splintered remains of Yugoslavia after a devastating ethnic war. Hungary, which was ruled by a right-wing authoritarian government before World War II, is now dominated by the proudly “illiberal” Viktor Orban, who has tried to rehabilitate former strongman Miklos Horthy.

Though these political movements are sometimes lumped in with the modern-day populists of Western Europe, they are, in key respects, more like their 20th-century predecessors. They are authoritarian and socially reactionary — anti-LGBTQ rhetoric is a favorite theme of Poland’s ruling party. Prewar evils such as irredentism and anti-Semitism are alive in mainstream politics to a degree they are not on the other side of the former Iron Curtain. Just ask emigre Hungarian Jewish financier George Soros, whom Orban cast as his leading opponent in the last national election.

What’s surprising to me is the extent to which communist-era politics have also survived. My assumption in 1989 was that Soviet-syle totalitarianism was an alien implant that would vanish from countries closer to Berlin than Moscow. Yet some legacies of communist rule have proved enduring, perhaps because they are all too compatible with the resurgent illiberal movements.

One is the use of state-run national television for political propaganda. After the establishment of democracy, Poland moved to make its government-owned network independent, similar to the BBC. That abruptly ended when the right-wing Law and Justice party came to power in 2015. Now state television glorifies the ruling party and slimes its opponents in a fashion eerily reminiscent of communist times. In Hungary, Orban has gone a step further, using state resources and friendly businessmen to all but eliminate independent media.

A second legacy is pervasive official corruption. In the morally nihilistic world of Eastern Bloc communism, everyone from traffic cops to Communist Party secretaries felt free to exploit the system for private profit. To a disturbing extent, that has not changed. Only a few months ago was Liviu Dragnea, Romania’s most powerful politician through the 2010s, finally imprisoned for abuse of power. As the New York Times recently documented, European Union subsidies have enriched Orban’s relatives and old friends.

In 1989, I predicted that Czechoslovakia would revert to the model of democratic pluralism it had under Thomas Masaryk, its president from 1918 to 1935. It did at first, thanks to Velvet Revolution leader Vaclav Havel. But the president of the Czech Republic today, Milos Zeman, is a sleazy tool of Russian interests; Prime Minister Andrej Babis was until recently under criminal investigation for fraud. Slovakia’s shady prime minister, Robert Fico, was forced to step down last year after the gangland-style murder of a journalist investigating corruption.

The most insidious communist legacy may be ahistoricism. After the war, while West Germany de-Nazified, East Germans, Hungarians and Poles were told they bore no responsibility for fascism or the Holocaust, which were portrayed as capitalist crimes. Today’s governments follow suit: Poland’s passage of a law criminalizing accounts of the Holocaust that hold Poles accountable is the quintessential example.

It’s hardly surprising that it is in the former East Germany that fascist-friendly movements such as the Alternative for Germany (AfD) have gained the most traction. In last month’s state election in the eastern state of Thuringia, the AfD won 23 percent of the vote and finished ahead of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats. Its local leader, Bjorn Hocke, has denounced the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin and called for an end to Germany’s “culture of remembrance.”

In many ways, of course, Eastern Europe is far better off than in 1989. Its people are vastly richer and, in spite of creeping authoritarianism, far freer. But the euphoria I saw and shared in that momentous weekend in Berlin seems a little naive 30 years later. We underestimated the tenacity of the culture created by Soviet communism — and the perils of a return to history.",,/r/europe/comments/dunvtk/the_politics_of_the_1930s_are_still_playing_out/f77c3is/,iberjamonico,1573450430

I'm all for other countries who has been courageux enough to recognise Armenian Genocide to also recognise these genocides for showing that it wasn't for political reasons or free moral points, but for something.

4103,"&gt;Haha no you don't, did you even consider how much Polish has changed since 1000 years ago? Look at english, it had heaps of literature even from the 14th century and it's almost unreadable to an English speaker today. Poland has been under all sorts of leadership and people. It's changed way more than English due to influence and lack of literature. I'm 100% certain about this.

Polish language didn't change a bit through ages, we read the oldest polish written texts on Polish Lessons in schools in original, without any help or ""translation"", we sign at curches religious songs as they were originally written centuries ago, becuase they are 100% compatibile with current Polish, nothing has changed. I even pasted one text to google translate and it translated it to english even better than modern texts.

But it doesn't matter, polish is still polish, we speak the same language, doesn't matter how much it envolved (close to zero). Ancient Romans were speaking latin, not itialian, and Ancient Egypatians were speaking ancient egyptian, not arabic.

4226,"&gt; Why is it shoved down everyone's throats.

Displays of straight relationships and culture are shoved down our throats the entire time. Most Hollywood scripts won't get approved if there's not a flat (straight) romance forced into it, and it's seemingly impossible for any product to not feature the implication that buying the product will have the opposite sex all over you. I'd ask if you're complaining about that as well, but I get the suspicion you want ""the good old days"" of religiously motivated puritanism. 

&gt;""Celebrating"" sexuality is a very weird concept I really do not get. 

Yes, you completely lack any basic historical perspective apparently. Homophobia is still very much alive and well, and is still fueled by people like you that want LGBT groups to *hide away* and be *ashamed* of who they are. Few things are as easy to make shameful as something to be hidden away.

Thank goodness for gay pride, because it has completely opened up what used to be taboo in *extremely recent* history. Just the idea of *being gay* was the ultimate punchline growing up, yet there's been a whole cultural awakening in the span of barely a generation, and it's a wonderful thing because where I grew up used to have a *vicious* country bumpkin attitude that made being gay a total nightmare for people, but that has changed with increased visibility and awareness.

If you're angry about pride marches then be angry at the bigoted dipshits that it was and *still is* necessary to fight against, because you're marching in tandem with them when you babble about ""fighting"" the pride movement, whether you realize it or not.

&gt; as long as they are not hurting others or themselves. Let people be happy.

Follow your own words. Pride movements *aren't hurting you*, and they're helping make a lot of people happy. So why would you be so concerned with crushing it other than ""i don't like it even though it doesn't hurt me.""",Norway,/r/europe/comments/dud4bh/reykjavik_today_from_a_friends_instagram/f76nfag/,BrainBlowX,1573430922

Even after partition Poles lobbied the Austrias not to recognize the Ukrainians language and were successful to a degree. Even after WW1 the poles annexed the region again and banned the Ukrainian language as well as Eastern Orthodox. 

The context is that Poland is not the eternal victim they portray themselves to be, they have to a large extent historically oppressed Ukrainians and Belorussians as well as some of their other minorities.

4539,"BERLIN—Thirty years after the Berlin Wall fell, ending the Cold War in Europe, new political divisions are rising between East and West.

Despite the economic success of German reunification and the triumph of democracy across Eastern Europe, the two regions are drifting apart again in a clash of values that is threatening the cohesion of the Western alliance and the European Union.

In most of the West, mainstream parties, while increasingly challenged by insurgent politicians, are largely sticking to a postwar consensus forged around liberal values, the rule of law, fundamental human rights and time-tested institutions.

Much of the East is a mirror image, where nativist parties that favor more authoritarian rule and reject immigration, ethnic and religious diversity, gay rights and feminism as signs of weakness and moral decadence are either in power or on the ascent.

Some Eastern European countries that once fought against Soviet oppression, such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, are now ruled by governments that vehemently reject some liberal Western values.

Even some former East German democracy activists are now marching against the establishment with far-left or far-right movements, including the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party or AfD, now among the country’s largest.

Vera Lengsfeld, a German author, academic and former legislator, received the Federal Cross of Merit, Germany’s highest peacetime honor, for battling the totalitarian regime of the former communist east. She was imprisoned after her husband, a poet, informed on her to the secret police.

But three decades after she watched the Berlin Wall crumble, Ms. Lengsfeld is unsheathing her quill for a new fight: against the liberal government of Chancellor Angela Merkel that she once supported.

Ms. Lengsfeld says she rejects the AfD, but she shares their criticism of Ms. Merkel’s generous asylum policy, and has campaigned against mass immigration. She says political correctness is threatening free speech, leading to her views being dismissed as extremist.

“I think the West has forgotten what democracy means,” she said. “The gap between the governments and the governed is widening, and the former despise the latter.”

In a series of interviews last week in German media, Ms. Merkel said such claims made in a free democracy like Germany were strange, and warned that freedom of expression doesn’t constitute the right to have one’s opinion unchallenged.

To be sure, the divides in Europe aren’t clear-cut. Some parties in Italy, France and Austria have rejected immigration and Islam, while eastern countries like Slovakia have chosen liberal governments. Recent elections ushered in a crop of liberal mayors to countries run by nativist parties, including Hungary and Poland.


Border Break
Citizens of the former East Germany say they are still less satisfied than their countrymen in the West. The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party is most popular in the former East Germany.

In his recent book, “The Light That Failed,” Ivan Krastev, a Vienna-based Bulgarian academic, explores how the two parts of Europe embraced each other, only to diverge again. Mr. Krastev cites studies about how despite the East’s economic surge, majorities who say they are satisfied with their lives still vote for antiestablishment nativists such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

Mr. Krastev said Mr. Orban and other self-proclaimed illiberal leaders pander to voters who rebel against what the academic calls the “replacement of communist orthodoxy with a liberal orthodoxy.”

In Mr. Krastev’s view, the dictate of communist apparatchiks in the East was replaced by the patronage of the EU and other international organizations who presided over painful economic overhauls.

Millions of people have left Eastern Europe for the West since 1989, robbing entire regions of their educated elites. In the former East Germany, which has lost nearly four million people since reunification, the AfD is particularly strong in places where more people have left.

The view of emigration as a threat to fragile communities also in part explains widespread opposition to immigration in the region, say some experts, Mr. Krastev says.

Eastern Europe, once among the world’s most diverse regions, was carved up by the Ottoman, Habsburg, Russian and German empires until those multinational states perished in the wars of the 20th century. The forced exchange of populations that followed yielded homogenous societies.

Branko Milanovic, a New York-based economist from Serbia, said the revolutions of 1989 were struggles of national emancipation more than a broad democratic uprising. Even as 1989 offered democracy followed by EU membership and rapid economic growth, Eastern nations never embraced ethnic diversity, Mr. Milanovic said.

Ironically for a region where citizens were banned from freely traveling during the Cold War, a study by Mr. Krastev for the European Council of Foreign Relations found that 50% of Poles and 49% of Hungarians favored making it illegal for their own citizens to leave for long periods as a policy response to migration.

Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland’s ruling party, has asked the U.S. to abandon the process of lifting visa requirements for Polish citizens for fear it could further fan emigration, according to two officials. Aides eventually persuaded him to give up his resistance to the visa waiver, which was then seen a diplomatic coup of his administration.

The Polish and Hungarian governments have both been accused in the West of curtailing freedom of the press and capturing the courts and other institutions of state. Both have been remarkably successful at the polls.

In the Czech Republic, Prime Minister Andrej Babis has stoked similar controversies. Pavel Telicka, a former ally of Mr. Babis who left the prime minister to form his own, liberal party, said he became disillusioned by the populism of his old ally. But he admits that politicians like Mr. Babis have successfully tapped into economic angst and frustration.

Despite strong growth, the former communist regions—including east Germany—haven't caught up with Western income levels. And the cradle-to-grave state support of the Soviet era is gone.

“The inability of traditional political parties to provide solutions to people’s problems has maybe helped the rise of populism,” said Czech Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek. He cited the EU’s failure to resolve the eurozone and refugee crises as a cause for disillusionment in his country.

Witold Waszczykowski, Poland’s former foreign minister, said the definition of liberalism changed within the West itself, expanding to include values such as ethnic diversity and LGBT rights after politicians embraced what he calls left-liberal democracy.

Helmut Kohl, the late German chancellor and architect of German and European reunification, foresaw the current backlash, according to Daniel Biskup, a photojournalist who documented the fall of the Wall and its aftermath in three books.

Mr. Biskup took a now iconic photograph of Mr. Kohl as he promised 100,000 people in the eastern state of Thuringia in 1990 to turn the impoverished land into “blooming landscapes.”

“He knew there could be trouble. He told me the blooming landscapes would only come if everyone—especially the West and its industry—pulled together,” Mr. Biskup said. “But that didn’t happen. We left market forces do their work.”

In October this year, the AfD won nearly 24% of the vote in Thuringia and became the second-biggest party, behind the radical left.

Back in East Berlin, Ms. Lengsfeld, the former dissident, said the social change that she herself helped bring about has now made her think about emigrating.

“If I were younger, I would emigrate myself. Maybe not to Prague, it’s overrun by tourists, but perhaps somewhere further East,” she said.",,/r/europe/comments/duex8e/the_iron_curtain_is_gone_but_europes_east_and/f74xo5w/,appa_ratus,1573409546

4542,"&gt; U.S. Congress is ready to impose sanctions on Turkey unless it abandons its Russian S-400 air missile defence systems, the Hill quoted the U.S. National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien as saying on Sunday.

&gt; There is no place in NATO for the S-400 system and U.S. President Donald Trump will deliver that message to his Turkish counterpart when Erdoğan visits Washington, O’Brien said during an interview with CBS.

&gt; Ankara and Moscow in Sept. 2017 signed a loan agreement for the supply of Russian S-400 air defence systems to Turkey. The United States and its NATO allies see the Russian system as incompatible with NATO systems and posing a security threat to the F-35 stealth fighter. Turkey began to take delivery of S-400 components  in late July, prompting Washington to remove Turkey from the F-35 fighter jets programme. 

&gt; “We’re very upset about that,” O’Brien said referring to Turkey’s procurement of the S-400 sytem, adding that “there will likely be sanctions” if Turkey does not “get rid of” the weapons. 

&gt; O’Brien also said Washington was  “very concerned” about possible Turkish war crimes in northern Syria, where Turkey has launched an offensive targeting U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.

&gt; “Some of the things that we’ve seen are very disturbing… we’re very concerned about the war crimes issues, we’re watching them, we’re monitoring them very closely,” the U.S. national Security advisor said. 

&gt; Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is scheduled to meet with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump in Washington this week amid soaring tensions over the Turkish offensive in Syria and the House of Representatives passing a resolution recognising the mass killings of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire in 1915 as genocide, a claim Turkey officially denies.",,/r/europe/comments/duey0d/sanctions_likely_unless_turkey_abandons_s400_says/f74xqi3/,bataneyelid,1573409576

4586,"&gt;This early Russia was at very unprotected and vunerable.

Yes.

&gt; There’s one major flaw to Russia’s geographical defense system--the northern European plain.
&gt;
&gt;Whereas every other border has a geographical defense preventing easy invasion from a foreign army, this completely flat plain just acts as a funnel easily bringing an army from Western Europe right up to Moscow . 

No.  You can't jump back to Napoleon and then roll forward to this.

I claim that Russia cannot win an air war against NATO.  Having lost an air war, it cannot win a land war, regardless of terrain.

Yes, Napoleon or Hitler tried quick land thrusts to knock out Russia.  But those were in technologically-different eras.

Look at recent US conflicts: they involve destroying air defenses, then heavy use of airpower.

&gt; A Ukraine that was friendlier to the west likely would have ended Russia’s lease on the port so in Putin’s mind, he needed to invade Crimea in order to prevent a crippling blow to Russia’s ocean access.

Sevastopol is not the only warm-water Black Sea port.  Russia has her own warm-water ports, most-notably at [Novorossiysk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Novorossiysk).

&gt; Some countries such as Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland are almost fully dependent on Russia for their natural gas . This gas dependency is a major reason why Germany, for example, a country with high Russian oil dependency, is much less likely to criticize Russia than a country like the UK, which has virtually zero Russian gas dependency. 

Oil and gas pipeline dependencies are not quite the same thing.  The percentage cost increase in transporting gas via ship is significantly higher than in moving oil via ship, and more-elaborate infrastructure at each end is required.

Also, while this is no doubt an *input*, I do not believe that it is nearly as dominant in simply public stances that countries take as the author seems to feel.  While Russia certainly can use the threat of gas cuts as leverage in serious matters, I think that she would be very, very, very unlikely to care much one way or another over simply whether a country criticized her or not.

Hell, Poland uses a good deal of natural gas from Russia, I doubt has the capacity to replace it via another pipeline or LNG on short notice, and Poland is quite critical of Russia.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/du8j9u/russias_geography_problem/f74zn3s/,duisThias,1573410232

4631,"&gt;And what drove the Arabs to an even bigger slave trade than the West

This is either false or very badly worded. The Atlantic Slave Trade at its height dwarfed in scale any slave trading operation in history. It is only surpassed when measuring cumulatively, comparing the relatively brief experience of colonialism with centuries, millennia of slave trading. I do not know what geographic region of the world has seen the most slavery and trade of slaves overall but a fair comparison would require adding the Roman slave trade to the Atlantic slave trade for example.

&gt;The West just excelled in it because it was so much more advanced than all the other parts of the world it sailed to. Which also contributed to the scale of things.

The main difference is that (radically) colonialism enabled the creation of an alternative to typical peasant-taxing, agrarian empire. Depending on your viewpoint, capitalism or industrialism or colonial imperialism or whatever. The focus on natural resources and goods drove a mentality that sought better control over the natural world for the purposes of exploitation, on top of social innovations to control/stabilize imperial subjects.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/du9lav/rest_in_peace_the_founder_of_the_republic_of/f74h2us/,_Whoop,1573402273

As it stands now Ireland,Sweden,Finland,Austria, and for that matter anyone who has signed the treaties needed for EU membership do not agree to mutual defence. So yes I can say categorically that NATO is far more robust guarantee of defense then the hand shack deal the EU currently has with it's own member states.

Secondly I'm talking about the general conduct of the western allies towards eastern europe in the second world war specifically, and its conduct throughout history in general. Between the Munich agreement and the Franco-Polish alliance I would not trust western Europe which on many occasion has thrown eastern Europe under the bus for it's own security, even well before the turn of the 20th century. WW2 was not the first time western Europe has let eastern europe fall for it's own security. Whether it be to the Prussian's, Russian's, Ottoman's,or Mongol's and anyone else.there is a limit to how often you trust the same actors over and over again.let us not forget that the US had no deal with Poland at the start of the second world war. We didn't break our word because we weren't stupid enough to promise to defend Poland, a task the French army in its defensive doctrine of the war could not actually accomplish.

Finally if western Europe wants to prove it can get the job done it has to prove it is willing to do it. Given current lack of military capacity, need for Russian raw resources, and a history of broken promises...I wouldn't trust western Europe to show. It's more likely to cut a deal with Russia then defend or counter-attack to liberate little old Latvia.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dtsw9y/russia_lauds_macrons_golden_words_about_brain/f74i33a/,vmedhe2,1573402718

&gt; The issue was in fact a major point of contention during the international negotiations regarding Germany's reunification. 

It was not contentious at all. Absolutely nobody in Germany with any kind of political power had any interest in reopening the issue.

4759,"Despite the efforts at reform, however, increases in tax revenue did not match the growing expenditure, so that the government more and more had to rely on foreign loans. Also, the rural population had to suffer a high tax burden as the government was trying to reduce the budget deficit. Among the taxes levied were property and military service exemption taxes as well as tithes. The latter were usually collected by private persons who were authorized by the government to do so.[32] This often lead to conflicts as, according to contemporary reports, the tax collectors abused their powers and exerted violence on the population.[33] In addition, an excise tax (Müskirat resmi) was charged on the manufacture of wine and spirits.[34] This affected only non-Muslim groups, as Muslims were not allowed to consume and produce alcohol. Another problem that came up with the reforms was that of double taxation. For instance, Armenians in the Anatolian provinces traditionally paid protection taxes to local notables and tribesmen, most of them Kurds. This practice did not vanish as the government extended its fiscal reach into the provinces. As a consequence, the Armenians suffered from a double tax burden, as well as from forceful tax collection practices and other acts of violence.[35]

On paper, that is what was supposed to happen, but as my reply before this one noted, the Armenians were being attacked by Muslim gangs and tribalists. 

They were not allowed to defend themselves and were expected to roll over and die compared to a Muslim(despite being a minority population). This is the reason why I noted that Allies consistently called for protection of the Armenians but the Ottomans failed to answer to their calls.",,/r/europe/comments/du3pvp/istanbul_technical_university_built_in_1861_by/f73v35i/,SandersIsAOldHack,1573395426

Wut? Young Turks had nothing to do with Ataturk. I don't understand how hard is it to just google it. 


&gt;Despite working with Young Ottomans to promulgate a constitution, Abdul Hamid II had dissolved the parliament by 1878 and returned to an absolutist regime, marked by extensive use of secret police to silence dissent, and by massacres committed against minorities. Constitutionalist opponents of his regime, most prominently Prince Sabahaddin and Ahmet Rıza, among other intellectuals, came to be known as Young Turks.[3] Despite the name, Young Turks included many Arabs, Albanians, Jews, and initially, Armenians and Greeks.[4] To organize the opposition, progressive medical students Ibrahim Temo, Abdullah Cevdet and others formed a secret organization named the Committee of Ottoman Union (later Committee of Union and Progress - CUP), which grew in size and included exiles, civil servants, and army officers. Finally, in 1908, pro-CUP officers marched the army to Istanbul, forcing Abdul Hamid to restore the constitution, and later deposing him.

&gt;“Good example” my ass, this guy is burning in hell with hitler.


Aaan there it is,the Hitler.


&gt;Turkey was never and will never be secular. They are borderline jihadist state right now, let alone anywhere near secular, and they never were close.


Turkey were secular and still is secular. I know you guys want to see us implement sharia law but it is too late now, sorry. It is clear, from the polls and votes, that Turkish population are highly supportive of secularism. The only issue people had was the headscarf/hijab ban, which was stupid anyway.


The recent polls made by KONDA, who literally predicted the recent elections by pinpoint accuracy, stated that %90 of population is in favor in secularism being in the constitution. The only difference being %50.6 saying it should stay the same and %40.7 saying it should be updated to make state treat all religion fairly and lastly %8.7 said it shouldn't be in the constitution.


Many may argue the secularism in Turkey is damaged due to state allowing hijab in universities and institutions. Hijab ban for universities were beyond retarded in the first place. It was preventing millions of girls from getting education. Now that the ban is over we see those same girls getting education and even leaving hijab behind.


Who would have guessed huh? Letting people into universities and letting them get education makes them more open-minded and progressive...",,/r/europe/comments/du9lav/rest_in_peace_the_founder_of_the_republic_of/f734bju/,ExtensionBee,1573387548

4903,"The Netherlands:

* Ongoing debate about the nitrogen-crisis. A couple of months ago a Dutch court ruled that the government's plans to reduce nitrogen-emissions were insufficient (the plans were basically 'emit as much as you want now if you promise to lower emissions in the future') and since then there have been major restrictions on new building projects and expansion/rebuilding permits. There have been major protests from farmers (they smashed the door of a governmental building) and builders. This week specifically, the Prime-Minister Mark Rutte stepped in and promised to deal with the crisis. In addition, the debate has been going on further on how emissions may be structurally lowered while projects can go through again. Possible solutions that have been offered are lowering (or even halfing) the amount of cattle in the Netherlands, lowering the speed limit on highways and cancelling certain projects like new airports or the growth of Schiphol. The Netherlands is a country with great nitrogen-pollution, which harms both nature and people's health.

* On wednesday there was a major education-strike. 80% of primary and high schools were closed as teachers all over the country went on strike for structural improvements of salary and lower working pressure. There is a great shortage in many parts of the country, especially in the big cities, and high work pressure leads to burn-outs and thus a bigger shortage. Friday last week the minister of education promised to invest €460 million, but this would be one time only and not structural, so the biggest teacher's union, while first seeming to accept it, went on with the strike after pressure from its members. The government says it is not possible to structurally improve teacher's salaries and alleviate work pressure because of budgetary restrictions and rules, and that they would need to wait for a new cabinet in about one and a half years. The teacher's union has said that as long as there would be no structural investments, they would strike structurally.

* Major debate about civilian deaths in Iraq as a result of Dutch bombings. A couple of weeks ago Dutch journalists uncovered that in 2015, Dutch troops were involved in a bombing on a bomb-factory in Iraq in 2015 that, because of the resulting explosions, killed at least 70 civilians. It seems now that after three days this was known at the Dutch ministry of Defence, but they did not inform parliament. The then minister of defence twice said that there had been no civilian deaths because of Dutch actions. Not informing or misinforming parliament is something many ministers have quit for in the last years. For this, the current minister of defence had to defend the actions of her predecessor this week. In doing so, she said that the current prime-minister also knew of this in 2015 but had not said so. A Vote of No Confidence was voted on, but it had 72 out of 150 votes and was thus rejected. The prime-minister now gets a lot of questions about what he knew and why he had not said so, but he denies any wrong doings and refuses to answer any questions for the time being.",Europe <3,/r/europe/comments/du98t4/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20191110/f72ufsp/,surpator,1573380259

4966,"That's not exactly true. In general, what you states is not related with the status of federation but with the way the legislature is built. In unicameral legislatures, the single house is often (but not always) in a way that gives more relative importance to smaller constituencies to avoid those being ignored. This system is used in the current Parliament and the unicameral aspect is reflected in the name ""Parliament"" which is the name of a legislature, implying Parliament is the only one responsible with the voting of bills.

It's not however. The EU actually has a form of bicameralism. In such system, the two houses have different role. In general the lower house represents the people and the seats are apportioned between constituencies to ensure they approximately have the same weight in the house as their demographic weight in the country (or in this case Union). That's the way the Bundestag or the Belgian Chamber of Representatives are built. The upper house can serve a variety of purposes depending on the place but often, in federal systems, it represents the states more (US Senate) or (German Bundesrat) less equally. In the EU, that would be the role of the Council of the EU...

So currently, we have a legislature with a lower house that is built to balance representation of the people and the states and an upper house that is built to represent the states.

A simple reform of Parliament could change that radically without interfering on anything, the only problem being that the member-states have to accept it...","Belgium, Benelux, EU",/r/europe/comments/du8ca0/number_of_members_of_the_european_parliament_by/f72v2fs/,loicvanderwiel,1573381293

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_Castle

&gt;Cinderella Castle is Cinderella's home fairy tale castle and the icon at the center of two Disney theme parks: the Magic Kingdom at the Walt Disney World Resort, and Tokyo Disneyland at the Tokyo Disney Resort. Both serve as the flagship attraction for their respective theme parks. Along with Sleeping Beauty Castle, the Castle is a symbol of The Walt Disney Company. 

-

&gt; Cinderella Castle was inspired by a variety of real and fictional palaces. These included Château d'Ussé, Fontainebleau, Versailles and the châteaux of Chenonceau, Pierrefonds, Chambord, Chaumont and the Alcázar of Segovia but primarily and most obviously Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria.

The two do have association, though I'd say that it'd be more-reasonable to call Disney's castle Neuschwansteinesque than the other way around.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dtuyli/neuschwansteindisney_castle_germanyoc/f72kcsj/,duisThias,1573366330

And don't believe that these people were praised. Maurice Bavaud was treated like shit in his homecountry. 

Many countries refused to take jewish refugees in the 1930s and 1940s. They didn't give a damn about them. They were unfamous in Russia, USA and many other european countries.

5205,"\&gt;The 1938 piece is obviously a reference to France's betrayal of Czechoslovakia, not Poland.

Fair enough, however still not exactly relevant. Nazi Germany is not comparable to Russia, and France and Great Britain are not comparable to the way they were in the interwar period. The policy of appeasement is not something anyone in France or Britain would ever repeat, it's seen as the greatest political failure of the interwar period, of which there were many.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; The US actually has significant numbers of troops in EE, has shown a high willingness to use military force in the past, AND IS NOT WORKING TO CURRENTLY NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. 

The USA has not normalized their relations with Russia ? You honestly, from the bottom of your heart, think that France is normalizing its relation with Russia more so than the USA is ? Forget the past, are you even aware of who is currently leading your country ? Speaking of showing high willingness to use military force, let's be clear they never have in EE. And again, it's ridiculous to insinuate that the USA would be more willing to fight for EU member states more than EU member states themselves. We are in the scenario that we are currently in because there are few EU militaries that have recovered from the second world war (and arguably the cold war), an EU army would obviously need greater military investment from the EU member states, Macron himself said this.

\&gt; De Gaulism may do well in France, but surely the French understand it comes with a trade off? If you are going to be strong and independent, dont be surprised when your 'allies' no longer trust you and see you more as a foe. 

Well first of all, the USA's current foreign policy is ""American First"", which is a sort of understatement. Also, France is already, largely, strong an independent. The European army would try to protect the strength and independence of the entire EU, it's not a French army you do realize ? Macron is not asking the EU to give him their men and military materials so he can play the role of European emperor. What Macron is advocating is not 'De Gaullism', however you have decided to define that, I'm not sure what is making you think this. Please explain.

\&gt; dont be surprised when your 'allies' no longer trust you and see you more as a foe. 

You think trust in France is falling ? More than trust in say, the USA, or Turkey ? It seems you are not aware of the way Europeans feel about the USA, especially since 2016. Look at German satisfaction of their relationship with France vs UK or USA, for example. No one in Europe who sees France as a 'foe' does not also see the USA as a 'foe'. But to be clear, no government that is part of the EU sees either as a foe, it seems you are over dramatizing the situation a little.",France,/r/europe/comments/dtsw9y/russia_lauds_macrons_golden_words_about_brain/f72d6x1/,Gosu-No-Pico,1573359164

5372,"&gt;How would a common European army, which would be much larger than Russia's, 'appease' them.

Putin has implied many times he [likes the idea of an EU army.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ww1-century-europe-putin/natural-that-europe-should-want-an-army-says-russias-putin-idUSKCN1NG0KY)

It's not surprising when you think about it.

NATO as a whole has 6 million soldiers.  Turkey, the US, and UK, make up about half that number.   Granted you would gain Sweden, and Finland, however somehow that doesn't sound as good.  

Also an EU Army would not be ""much larger"" than the Russia Army.  It would actually only be slightly larger, as The Russian Military has 3.5 Million soldiers, and the EU would have about 4 million.  

Note: Significant numbers of both would be conscripts, as Finland alone has just under a million conscripts, and Russia has even more.  Quality of soldiers is not taken into account here

However, I'm sure you can understand why Russia would prefer an EU Army to NATO.  From the Russian perspective they can either fight the US/UK/Turkey/Canada/Norway or they can fight Sweden and Finland.  No offense to Sweden, and Finland but somehow NATO just sounds tougher.

5415,"I can see why that would be the Canadian perspective - I'm trying to put myself in ya shoes and I can certainly see why your opinion would be as such. But consider it from a UK perspective: although the ex-colonies (excluding the US, I do think they are culturally very much their own thing) do share a root culture and recent history with us here in the UK, for a UK citizen our focus is very much on our own little group of countries. England, Scotland and Wales have been interacting with eachother for over 1000 years and we are an unhappy little family of sorts. Our cultural interactions and political focus are mostly between these countries. At least from my perspective they will be the ""family of nations"" for almost all Brits, even nationalists who want to break up the UK in all three mainland British nations will probably say the closest cultural nations are the other UK nations.

 But outside of that, we also have close history with our European neighbours that perhaps isn't shared in the wider commonwealth. Take Denmark - we have over 1000 years of shared history too, and there are many parts of England where Danish historical influence was strong (compare Danish town names Brondby and Visby with English towns Oadby, Corby or Buckby), god knows we have history with the French as well! Despite recent politics we (well, at least 48% of us, maybe more) feel we belong to the European family as *well* as the UK family and a wider English speaking culture.

Certainly, that linguistic barrier you were talking about is a real thing, and nations that share a language have an easier time with cultural exchange and interchange, and to an extent I agree that our media culture is swamped by Americanisms, we all probably become more American every day as we consume it. But there are other aspects of daily life that differ - for instance my friends and family who have been to Australia and Canada were stunned by how large houses are and how far apart they often are - the sheer distances between places and the wildernesses inbetween etc. This ""frontier"" culture has no doubt had a big influence on Canada and Australia (albeit in very different ways due to the landscapes being so different) but when I travelled to the Netherlands I was struck by how similar the architecture was and the feeling of people living on top of each-other in dense cities.  I think there is more to culture than *just* a language - but again, I do completely see your point. I wouldn't say ""I'm culturally *NOT* similar at all to the other English speaking nations outside of Europe"" because it wouldn't be true at all, there is certainly a shared culture there. But I do think in the UK we also have that relationship with Europe (which although it is politically strained, has existed for thousands of years simply because we exist 20 miles off the mainland) which is different from New Zealand or English-speaking South Africa. 

I think all Commonwealth nations will share some things and have a surface level ease-of-access for each-others cultures, but I also think they each have a deep individuality that would take much learning to really understand - for us in the UK our historical sites like Stonehenge, Hadrian's Wall, Sutton Hoo, Dover Castle or Canterbury Cathedral are very much a part of our culture and heritage, and I often don't think that is understood outside of the ""chips, tea and the queen"" image of the nation portrayed abroad.",I DEMAND A MERCIA FLAIR,/r/europe/comments/dtsl69/my_grandparents_neighbour_has_the_old_imperial/f71o0ga/,MercianSupremacy,1573344423

5427,"&gt; This is not due to radiation or anything from the nuclear power plant necessarily, way more likely that it is due to other things in the areas where nuclear power plants are placed, that also makes them good candidates for power plants.

And you base your assumption on ... what? Your own link *confirms* the study's findings and admits increased risks in the proximity of nuclear power plants, but then goes on to state that they cannot prove a link to said plants. They do so without offering any other possibility, effectively ending with ""we have no clue"".

Now, in a way this is merely good science: the authors simply lack the necessary data to definitely prove these conditions were caused by the power plants. Why you take this as evidence that the plants have no effect is beyond me, though. If you eliminate nuclear power plants as the *one* factor that all these locations have in common, you merely see what you want to see.

[Here](https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanhae/PIIS2352-3026\(15\)00094-0.pdf) is a more recent (2018) international study regarding the health of employees working inside nuclear power plants. As it turns out, their risk to suffer leukemia is four times as high as that of other workers.

[As per a WHO report](https://www.iarc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pr235_E.pdf), even very low doses of radiation increase the risk of cancer if the exposure persists over a longer period of time, challenging the widespread belief that small doses are harmless. As it turns out, what matters is the grand total you accumulate.

Which might explain the fate of the children mentioned earlier, and why the German Doctors Association in 2008 could not fathom the connection even when it appeared obvious.

&gt; People die in the construction and maintenance of solar and wind.

People also die in the construction and maintenance of nuclear. We should differentiate accidents from tolerated cost. It's no different than looking at how many people suffer from the results of climate change.

&gt; The inverse, nuclear has had massive lobbying against it for decades, that's why economical stuff like reprocessing and stuff is banned.

Are you for real? [Reprocessing isn't banned](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/fuel-recycling/processing-of-used-nuclear-fuel.aspx), it's just more expensive, which is why the industry tends to shun it in favor of cheaper mining. Get your facts together.

I would also say there is also a notable difference between wealthy, profit-oriented megacorporations with direct access to politicians lobbying, and citizens who are concerned about their own safety and parties utilizing normal politics in a democracy. Maybe in the future there will be a ""renewables lobby"", but arguably so far it does not have nearly as much influence as its nuclear relative, potentially because the renewable sector tends to feature more and smaller companies, whereas by comparison nuclear is the territory of a few giants.

In France it was so bad that the government had to dismantle its own safety regulator as it was found to have been infiltrated by the industry. Its successor, the ASN, promptly released a long list of shortcomings where French power plants did not meet existing standards, shutting down 20 of France's 58 reactors. Yet even the new and improved ASN [attempts to conceal the extent of accidents](https://www.dw.com/en/reports-fessenheim-nuclear-accident-played-down-by-authorities/a-19093477).

&gt; And stricter than necessary safety procedures have been forced upon the industry.

Seems to have worked nicely in Fukushima.

&gt; although i guess leftist mostly deny economics, but i'm not sure what your stance is on that

Insulting my intelligence in lieu of arguments, I see. Let me try: does your brain not compute the fact that economy of scale also works for renewables?

&gt; Solar energy is massively subsidised. If Germany had spent the money they spent on subsidising solar on nuclear, they would have close to a 100% green energy today

Hah, that's rich. Just cleaning up the Asse II underground waste repository is going to cost the German taxpayer six billion Euros. I also find the claim that nuclear energy is ""green"" amusing.

&gt; Just like every single construction accident in a solar plant and wind plant. Planes are safer than cars, but you don't hear about every car accident .

I'm fairly sure accidents in solar and wind don't get actively concealed, at least. :)

&gt; ??? So what, do you know how many incidents happen across 701 wind mills, and the backup coal or biomass required.

Can *you* tell *me*, or are you just spouting hot air because you can't think of a better retort? At the very least I am reasonably certain that you don't suffer an increased risk of cancer just from working at a wind mill or living in its vicinity.

&gt; Chernobyl is a super green area, fokushima area is mostly fine. The problem was government overreaction, ofc the accident was also really bad but nowhere near what the media makes it out to be, no one died.

[You are either lying or you are just misinformed](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45423575). It's funny how you claim government ""overreaction"" when the Japanese government kept pretending everything was gravy for several days. You also seem to be unaware of the [serious mutations](https://www.businessinsider.com/birth-defects-related-to-chernobyl-2016-4?r=US&amp;IR=T) in your ""green"" Chernobyl.

&gt; And newer plants are also way safer so not really comparable

[Suuure](https://www.neimagazine.com/news/newshot-testing-of-mohovce-3-revealed-the-need-for-further-modifications-7413902).

Money will always play a role. I don't know where you get the idea that for-profit companies won't attempt to save as many bucks as they can get away with. You must really trust these companies a lot, in spite of everything that happened so far, all the accidents, and all the attempts at concealing them (and who knows what actually has successfully been kept under wraps).

&gt; here is a study showing solar and wind is more dangerous

Oh, from the **International Atomic Energy Agency**, a lobby group. What unbiased sources you rely on. Do you know how many seconds it would take me to find a counter-study from an anti-nuclear website?

Are you sure about that ?  See, the way I see it it looks like certain elements in the EU are not happy without ""projecting power / influence"" outside of Europe, without even asking first if such a thing s welcome by the natives .


You can cloak such intervention in the guise of benevolence -- but you do so without looking at your previous ""benevolent""  attempts at playing ""white mans burden"" .



Right now the EU is caught between telling itself that it's in competition with China over Africa , but also that it better ""elevate"" Africa soon , or the projected 3-4 Billion population explosion that the UN predicts for Africa (and the subsequent migration explosion to Europe) will sink Europe and Africa at the same time .


But hey, if you think that this is all safe and you are now not the conquistadors of yesteryear and won't interfere with the natural development of the locals -- be my guest .

5725,"I mean, sure it's a point, and it's a very good one at that.

It's easy for ethnically and culturally homogenous, say, Switzerland to have low rates on income inequality and high rates of quality of life within its system precisely because their share of both poor people historically that they've taken in is low and their cultural and ethnic homogeneity precludes some of the problems you get with completely disparate ethnically separate groups of people on top of one another.  Along with being small enough that these programs that are ""national"" in origin are actually ""local"" in nature, relative to the US.

For the most part, the US does pretty well with high levels of heterogenity - take a place like Queens and Brooklyn (two contiguous boroughs of NYC), which are together the same population size as Switzerland/Slovakia/Denmark, yet 108 different languages are spoken on a SINGLE BLOCK of a particular street, which makes things like delivery of medical care and access to any sort of social service far harder than the comparator in those countries.  And what's telling is that you see the same problems in places like Switzerland or Denmark that the US faces when you start having even relatively small groups of poor ethnically heterogenous people start settling in them en masse.

But if you're arguing that the US ""could do better"" with its homeless (which is disproportionately those of minorities) vis a vis SPECIFICALLY the EU as if it were a country, I won't dispute that -- I just think it's a harder problem because the EU doesn't have nearly the heterogeneity overall that the US has, and when it does, it runs into these problems as well.  The US also has a ton of self-made formerly poor, now rich people as compared to the EU, so things like the Gini coefficient (higher in the US than EU) are affected on both ends of the scale.",,/r/europe/comments/dtpnh4/american_values_vs_western_european_values/f700d1q/,VisionGuard,1573322967

There were also some issues at Schiphol Airport because a pilot accidentally pressed the emergency button. He wanted to show it to a pilot in training. Lots of police were called because they thought it might be a potential hijacking.

Reddit pushes the narrative that poor people make bad choices because they are spending all their time working three jobs to survive, but in reality the poor have more leisure time than any other income quintile and higher living standards than the bottom quintile of most of the western world. Until you reach the super rich, the more money you make, the less free time you have.

5805,"&gt;**In the meantime, police and districts are organizing joint operations against clann criminality every week. Shisha bars and cafes are searched. Is this the right approach?**
You have to do that. One should not leave the groups alone. What holds the group together is profit. As long as it pays to be criminal, they will remain criminal. The action of the police is not enough on its own. More decisive is the action of the judiciary. Since 2017, she has an instrument, the Asset Extraction Act. But the law, which is actually the implementation of an EU directive, has been watered down in Germany. There is no significant reversal of the burden of proof in the law. Therefore, it is feared that the 77 confiscated property of the family Remmo can not be confiscated and that the state must eventually return them, because he still has to prove that they are stolen property. The Remmos claim the money comes from Lebanon and from legal businesses,

However, the presumption of innocence, which is regulated in the Basic Law, also applies.
Yes, but that must not lead to dumbing down. If someone has never worked their entire life and possesses huge property, you have to have the right to ask where it comes from. Italy has done that and has recruited over 3 000 mafia companies.

&gt;**The Bundestag MP Ulla Jelpke recently called the clan's persecution ""racist"" and called for an end to the ""dirty campaign"". What do you think?**
This is a good example of an irresponsible attitude caused by ideological glasses. What bothers me most of all is that it happens at a time when the local authorities, the mayor of Neukölln, Mr Hikel and his deputy, Mr Liecke, are very much pulling together to solve the district's problems. The intervention of Mrs. Jelpke is an act of sabotage.

&gt;**In your book, you write that you can only get to the clans through the women. Can you explain that?**
In Lebanon, the extended family has a protective function. Here in the welfare state, all these tasks are taken over by the state. Actually, the clan should dissolve. But solidarity is maintained by endogamy. It is one hundred percent higher in Berlin than in Lebanon. This can only be achieved through forced marriages, by marrying minors. These are both offenses. It is common practice among Islamists. The oppression of women is crucial to the cohesion of the group. This happens in collaboration with some mosques that conduct such religious marriages and family counseling. For years I speak of dropouts. They are for boys, but there is nothing for the girls. When women rebel, the clan structure breaks down and integration becomes possible.

For instance, if you like opera or medieval castles, then Savonlinna is certainly a place to go.
If you like museums then almost every town in Saimaa has some, but Mikkeli has the most. If local nature is your thing then for instance Imatra could be nice as near it there's an island filled with these formations knows as hiidenkirnu (devil's churn (?)) which are somewhat rare elsewhere as they were created during the ice age, Imatra also boasts an absolutely gorgeous hotel known as the Valtionhotelli (state's hotel) which is of this funny castle/manor hybrid building style. Joensuu and one other place which's name I have forgotten has got some amusement parks. For trecking you'd like to visit Puumala as just last year they opened a new 60km route which was voted very highly among the best new sights last year along with a shorter 13km route as well. Lastly if boats and water is your thing then then Sulkava has an annual boat race and presumably some possibilities in other times as well.

And yeah, that was only like half the results of my quick google-fu (sadly most results were only in Finnish so admittedly searching for info would be harder for others).

If the US was not here, Putin might be even more bold and that is not something I would like to see. In that respect, the US remains kind of a necessary evil.

Most importantly, we would need to fill the void with someone else. We would need to strengthen our ties with other countries. What are our alternatives? China is worse.

5994,"Yeah, the truth is often between two extremes. Countries that are not directly affected don't feel stressed to make it a priority, whereas countries that do have populists that exaggerate the issue. Just politics, I suppose, but as a bloc we should work to improve this disconnect between domestic and international debate.

I try to look at it from what I'd call rationally: a few countries suffer undue pressure purely because their geographic position in the bloc makes them entry points, and the Dublin Regulation thus renders them solely responsible (unless another country volunteers to shoulder part of the burden, like Germany did for Syrian refugees). This is bad for the Member States in question, it's bad for asylum applicants, and it's bad for the EU as a whole as it provides fuel to euroskeptic populists.

It's an unfair system that I think needs to be reformed, also for the simple reason that geographic position should not be a disadvantage for membership, not to mention that the European Union also exists to help tackle individual Member States' problems as a group. Apart from the issues we see today, the status quo also creates a weird incentive to extend the EU's borders just to push the Old Maid onto the next newly accepted Member State.

Burden Sharing, a bigger European support budget and better coordination/oversight, even the idea of offshore reception centers are all mechanics that need to be considered. We've got some breathing room now, and in spite of some national politicians still trying to stir the flames it's no longer a crisis .. but in the current geopolitical climate (and expected environmental changes) it's only a matter of time until we face similar troubles again.
