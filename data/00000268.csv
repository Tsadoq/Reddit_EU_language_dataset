	Across the road from Viktor Orban’s modest farmhouse in his childhood village of Felcsut stands a temple to the Hungarian prime minister’s passion: football. With a slate roof and wooden supports evoking illustrations from Hungarian folklore, the Pancho Arena — from the nickname of Ferenc Puskas, widely regarded as the country’s greatest footballer — seats 3,800. The population of Felcsut, about 45km west of Budapest, is little more than 1,600.

At the end of the road runs a narrow-gauge railway along which, three times a day, a little red tourist train chugs 6km to an even smaller village, Alcsutdoboz, where Mr Orban lived until he was 10. The train, closed in the 1970s but reopened last year with €2m EU funding, is largely empty most days.

The railway and stadium have been pilloried by the prime minister’s critics as vanity projects. But they have something else in common. Both were built, in part, by Felcsut’s mayor, and a childhood friend of Mr Orban, Lorinc Meszaros. Until a few years ago, Mr Meszaros was a gas fitter. Thanks to winning state contracts, he jumped to number five in this year’s list of the wealthiest Hungarians compiled by website Napi.hu. In a year, his fortune soared from Ft23bn (€73m) to Ft120bn.

Asked by reporters how he had grown his business faster than Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook, Mr Meszaros quipped, “Maybe I’m smarter.”

Mr Meszaros is just one of several businessmen with close links to Mr Orban and his ruling Fidesz party whose wealth has surged since it came to power in 2010. Foreign scrutiny has largely focused on how Hungary’s government has dismantled democratic checks and balances, created what Mr Orban calls an “illiberal democracy” and embraced a hardline nationalist, anti-immigrant ideology. Yet as Fidesz has entrenched its control, a circle of wealthy businesspeople has arisen around the party and the prime minister — in essence, a group of loyalist “oligarchs”.

	Anti-corruption campaigners, bankers and opposition politicians say Hungary has shifted to a form of “crony capitalism”, increasingly resembling models found farther east in ex-Soviet republics, where business success is intertwined with political power. Hungary’s government-favoured tycoons may be worth only hundreds of millions, not the billions of dollars of, say, Russia’s oligarch class. But critics say its economic structure is becoming a miniature version of Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

The difference is that Hungary has built this system within the EU — in part, using EU funds. Much of the new Fidesz-linked business elite has achieved its success primarily through state contracts, about 60 per cent of which are funded by the EU.

“Since 2010, going along with the distortion of the whole institutional system, basically Fidesz and oligarchs close to Fidesz have captured the state,” says Jozsef Peter Martin, executive director of Transparency International, the anti-corruption group, in Budapest. “The most worrying thing about Hungary’s development today is cronyism.”

Until a few years ago, most Hungarians were aware of only one Fidesz oligarch, the publicity-shy Lajos Simicska. Mr Simicska went through school, army service and university with Mr Orban, then helped him build Fidesz from a 1980s pro-democracy youth movement into the party that now rules Hungary.

	https://www.ft.com/content/ecf6fb4e-d900-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482

	From the early 1990s, Mr Simicska used party money to create business ventures to fund Fidesz. He assembled a loyal media empire and, thanks largely to state contracts, a sprawling construction business. But after the two men fell out in 2015 — in part over attempts by Mr Orban to clip the wings of his ally — Mr Simicska was squeezed out of some media assets and stopped winning contracts. Opportunities opened for new, loyal businessmen.

“Orban apparently doesn’t want another Simicska, someone as powerful as him,” says Andras Petho, editor of investigative website Direkt36. “So what we are seeing now is several little Simicskas.”

Not so little. While the upper echelons of Hungary’s rich list remain dominated by business people who emerged in the 1990s, there have been several striking rises apart from Mr Meszaros. At 14th in Napi’s list this year with estimated wealth of €192m was Andy Vajna, a Hungarian-American who made some of his fortune as a Hollywood producer of films including Rambo and Total Recall. Mr Orban stayed with him as a young Fidesz MP on a US trip in the 1990s. Mr Vajna was appointed Hungary’s film commissioner by Mr Orban in 2011 and, having returned to Hungary, has replaced Mr Simicska as a leading pro-Fidesz media baron.

At 23rd was Istvan Garancsi, another friend of Mr Orban and owner of his second-favourite football club, Videoton, with an €80m fortune — three times his worth when the prime minister came to power in 2010. Despite Mr Simicska’s fall from grace, he is Hungary’s 11th-richest man, worth €256m. A wealth list in last month’s Forbes Hungary magazine, with marginally different estimates, put all four men among Hungary’s top 21 richest.

Fidesz’s large parliamentary majority and dominance of national and many regional institutions gives it several ways of helping favoured business people. Everything from lucrative state advertising to business licences can be channelled to friendly entrepreneurs. A study by two Hungarian academics this year found that state-owned companies account for 26 per cent of print advertising, 15 per cent of online advertising, and 7 per cent of TV ad revenues.

101,"You forgot the main headline of this past week:

- **The suspect in the kidnapping of a little girl this summer has been indicted for the murder of a man.... he may be a serial killer**.

I mentioned in previous weekly threads that in late August, 9-year-old Maëlys disappeared from a wedding party.  Her body still hasn't been found but the police have identified  a suspect: 34 year-old Nordahl Lelandais. (He was a guest at the wedding but denies any involvement in Maëlys's disappearance despite several pieces of evidence pointing towards him). He was indicted in this case two weeks ago or so.

Well this week there was a dramatic new development: this suspect was indicted in another case, and investigators announced they will be looking into other ""cold cases"" because they think he might be a serial killer. (He may be involved in the famous Alps shooting of the British Al-Hilli family, but that's just an hypothesis as of now so let's not get carried away).


*Here are some more details, if you are fascinated by mysterious criminal cases*:

-On top of being indicted in Maëlys' s disappearance/murder case, he now is also indicted in the murder of Arthur Noyer, a 23 years old soldier who disappeared in the same region in mid April: Investigators were unable to find a lead until a skull was discovered at the beginning of September. 3 months later, the DNA exam concluded it belonged to him (no idea why it took as long as 3 months to perform this DNA analysis). They also connected the 2 cases (Arthur Noyer's and Maëlys') because Nodahl Lelandais's car was spotted near the place where Arthur Noyer disappeared, as well as his mobile phone. And about two weeks after Noyer's disappearance, Nordahl Lelandais googled ""decomposition of a human body"": investigators in Maëlys's case were shocked because it was too early to be connected to her disappearance, hence why they started to suspect he may be linked to another case. 

So now the police is going to examine several other unsolved disapareance cases that occurred in that same region quite recently:

-Adrien Mourialmé, a 24 year-old Belgian chef was working in the Savoie region and disappeared in July of this year.

-Jean-Christophe Morin, 23 years old, disappeared as he left an electro festival in September 2011, still in the same region.

-Ahmed Hamadou, 45 years old, disappeared one year after Morin, on the 8th of September 2012, near the same music festival.

-Adrien Fiorello, 22 years old, disappeared in October 2010. The data of his cell phone places him in Chambéry before he vanished. (It's an older case but the location is again very close to Lelandais's wearabouts and to the other disappearances).

-Then there's the famous Al-Hilli shootings, which occurred on the 5th of September 2012 near the Annecy lake. ( Remember this story? 3 members of a British family were killed in the French Alps, back in 2012, their two young daughters had survived and it remained a very mysterious case in which several leads were explored but gave nothing: Was the father's brother involved, since they were not in good terms it seemed? Could it be linked to industrial espionage, given the father's sensitive job and Iraqi origins? Who was the true target: the Al-Hilli family or the other victim, a cyclist investigators believed to have been an unfortunate bystander at first? Or were the victims picked at random by a crazy murderer?)

-As well as looking into the ""cold cases"" in the Savoie region, investigators will also be looking into those of the Marne region where Lelandais was stationed as a soldier between 2002 and 2007. In January of 2003, another 9 year-old girl disappeared: Estelle Mouzin, she was never found. It might be a stretch but Lelandais wasn't that far from her home. 

So, as you can imagine, all this made quite the headlines this week. Investigators are asking everyone to not jump to conclusions, the suspect may have nothing to do with all of these disappearances and he is still innocent until proven guilty of the two murders for which he has been indicted, of course.

Apart from this, slow news week (the government will present a new immigration reform soon: we've been talking about it but the details are still vague so I'll update you on it next year).

111,"I've been to Andalusia, yes, all over it (Cordoba, Seville, Granada, Jerez, Malaga, Algeciras, Cadiz, Ronda), mostly in the interior, and I've done a lot of cycling in particular in the Sierra Nevada on small roads. The road quality there is very high.

Indeed one thing I remember is how frequently they seemed to resurface the things, often cycling in Spain I'd come across a resurfacing crew and the number of *pristine* tarmac surfaces was very high even (in fact particularly) in climactic conditions that swung from snow in the winter to blistering hot in the summer which is very hard on them.

I've cycled in around 35 different countries (I cycled my bike from Ireland to Indonesia, among other trips- including cycling across Spain several times) and as a cyclist, honestly, we notice these things and the roads in Spain are very very good. Certainly better than Ireland, despite Ireland having over double the GDP per capita. In fact I'd probably say the roads in Spain are better than *any* other country in the world I have been to. I think France, Germany, Austria, Singapore, Canada, the United States, (roads there, being a socialist evil, are terrible) all richer countries, but no, the roads in Spain are definitely better.

Obviously there are going to be individual examples of roads anywhere that aren't great but overall, I honestly can't think of anywhere that has better roads. The UAE is pretty good, China is pretty good, for more main roads only, Thailand where I live now is pretty good, but that's all in relation to the surrounding countries.

&gt;I’m definitely not making this up.

I believe you. However, facts can be presented very differently, and often are in order to further a political agenda. A leftist might call privatization reforms in healthcare selling out public health and allowing corporate fatcats to pocket the money. Another might call it  increased freedom of choice in the healthcare, as opposed to a nanny-state.

In summary, I am still very sceptical that their own reasoning was that they thought they need to preserve inefficient working methods (unless you can provide a primary source, in which case I'll happily change my mind!). To me it seems more likely that they intended to reduce unemployment or something, which according to some may have the unintended consequence of preserving inefficient working methods.

It's more interesting when be talk about absolute figures, and indeed a reason why poorer countries should share less of the burden, but still, it's a different issue. 

Secondly, the idea of refugees being sent to countries that weren't their first choice was partially meant to decrease the number of economic migrants applying for asylum. It's a good argument to deny someone's request if they refuse to stay in a safe country where they can live under human conditions. At the very least they can be refused accommodation in other countries.  So these measures should have decreased the number of refugees in total. 

Thirdly, and this is the most important one. You can't have open borders without a somewhat working system for asylum applications. At some point too many refugees coming to the Northern EU will lead (and have lead) to closed borders, i.e. Greece and Italy being left to deal with the entire situation.

439,"&gt; That’s what the UN is for.

And they'v failed. Time after time again, the UN has failed to act. Wars and genocides have happened on their watch, and they'v failed every time to prevent it.

&gt; We don’t have that right, it’s not up to us.

I don't see why that right belongs to us any less than it belongs to some strongman dictator. Besides, we would be trying to do this diplomaticly first. Peacekeeping would, hopefully, be done with the consent of the government of the countries we do it in. However, when it gets to how bad it is in places like Syria, it seems the potential for diplomacy has run out.

&gt; You can’t just go into another country and take it over.

Why? To go into an unstable dictatorship, rebuild it's infastructure, build a democracy, and destroy the terrorists there? And leaving after that is done? I fail to see whats wrong with that on paper. The only issues come with when you fail to do that, but after seeing Iraq, I don't think anyone will be so reckless as to do that again. We'll be a lot more careful than that.

&gt; I would have thought a fellow Irish person of all people would realise this.

If your referring to the British, I can't see how its the same thing. They conquered us, committed genocides, oppressed our culture and religion, and abused us for their own financial gain. 

That is not who we, as Europe, are any more. Or at least I'd hope we aren't.

This will be about stabilising these places. Ending war and conflict. There is no comparisome.

&gt; We can not enforce our rule on others.

And a strongman dictator who gasses his own people can? 

Europe has to understand it's place in the world. Pax Americana has led us to a place, I believe, where we do not know what to do with ourselves. Now that Pax Americana is in it's decline, we must decide what it is we stand for in the world. This doesn't nessessarily mean we should do what I supported here. (Though I think we should do that) But Europe must decide it's place in the world. We cannot act as the American's little brother any more. We must stand on our own, and figure out what it means to do that.

552,"&gt;IT IS a measure of populism’s rise that the announcement of a coalition deal between the centre-right Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) and the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) on December 16th caused barely a ruffle. When the two last formed a government, back in 2000, the news provoked diplomatic sanctions: visits and meetings were cancelled. No longer exceptional, Austria faces no sign of any such quarantine in Europe today.

&gt;To be sure, there are concerns in Berlin and Brussels. The FPÖ, which has a “co-operation agreement” with Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party and is close to the autocratic leaders of Hungary and Poland, will henceforth run Austria’s foreign, interior and defence ministries—and with them the country’s diplomatic and security services. But this is a shift of degree, not direction: the Alpine republic has long been doveish on Russia and closer to the central Europeans than to Angela Merkel on both immigration and Islam. The coalition agreement commits Austria to the EU and the euro, and Sebastian Kurz, the incoming chancellor, will take over European competences that used to sit in the foreign ministry (as did he).

&gt;If Austria in 2000 presaged the recent populist surge, the country’s new government, too, may contain glimpses of wider trends. (Something similar already exists in Norway, where the Conservatives govern in alliance with the more populist Progress Party.) Taking over as leader only in July, Mr Kurz took his ÖVP from third place to first by melding a modern style (sidelining the dinosaurs and recruiting candidates from outside politics) with a commitment to do something about Austrian economic underperformance, coupled with an uncompromisingly right-wing stance on crime and immigration. Conservatives elsewhere in Europe are watching with interest. Jens Spahn, a junior German finance minister who is regarded as a possible successor to Mrs Merkel, snapped selfies with Mr Kurz at the ÖVP’s election-night party on October 15th.

&gt;Meanwhile, the FPÖ’s revival—its six-year spell in government from 2000 split the party and cost it half of its voters—under Heinz-Christian Strache is a model for populist nationalists. “HC”, as he is known, gave the party a more youthful image, embraced social media before other politicians and rejected the FPÖ’s erstwhile anti-Semitism (recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital long before Donald Trump) in favour of an anti-Islam credo. France’s National Front and the Alternative for Germany party have both taken inspiration from his strategy.

&gt;The coalition agreement is a synthesis of the two men’s political projects. Maintenance payments for accepted refugees will more than halve to €365 a month, and newcomers will have to hand over any cash they have and waive some rights to medical secrecy. Islamic schools will be monitored more closely and closed if they break rules or accept foreign funding. Drugs and sex crimes will attract tougher sentences. Over 2,000 more police will patrol the streets. Income and corporation tax will fall. Austria’s corporatist labour and welfare model will be liberalised: maximum working time will rise to 12 hours a day, for example, and job-based insurance funds will be consolidated.

&gt;But can Mr Kurz avoid being forced to make less palatable concessions to the FPÖ? Some in Vienna (including Die Presse, an ÖVP-friendly newspaper) compare him to David Cameron, another metropolitan conservative reliant on the Eurosceptic right. “What Tory hardliners were for Cameron the FPÖ could be for Kurz,” predicts Josef Lentsch, a think-tanker who is close to the liberal NEOs party, adding that although an “Öxit” referendum on EU membership is off the cards, the new chancellor will soon find himself under pressure to pick fights with Brussels and edge closer to the nationalist governments to the east. “I trust that the Austrian government will continue to play a constructive and pro-European role,” said Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, on December 18th.

595,"&gt;You did not contradict anything I said.



OK.  Here's the long version.



Refugees are admitted to USRAP about they pass an interview with a USCIS officer on a circuit ride.  The officer then approves the application, pending CLASS, SAO, and IAC security reviews/checks. The refugee is expected to pass the health testing conducted by IOM on-camp.  If not, the refugee is grounded until concerns are resolved/treatment shows inactivity.



UNHCR constitutes the absolutely largest pool of referrals to USRAP.  The other possible referrals to USRAP are through US consulates for individual case adjudication (or P1 designation) or through the family reunification program (or P3 designation).



UNHCR referrals are not determined by the U.S., which in turn MUST accept whatever referrals UNHCR officers make.



On a different note, I've personally seen cases sent to the U.S. that included known cancer AND severe PTSD AND known prior genital mutilation.  I should add that the U.S. is responsible for the resettlement of the largest bulk of refugees identified by UNHCR every year.  We have been absolutely dwarfing any other refugee resettlement program run by any other country.  There are so many cases I have seen stateside that would be rejected by a country looking for the best.  Think just that most refugees come into the US with very little education and that most barely passed high school or a reasonable equivalent of that in the U.S.




TLDR: I can safely say I'm thoroughly acquainted with the refugee resettlement program implemented in the U.S. to its tiniest details and that the U.S. DOES NOT CHOOSE the refugees resettled stateside.",,/r/europe/comments/7lpur1/swedish_finance_minister_to_asylum_seekers_dont/drpntb4/,el_el,1514146306

None of these are intended to be a documentary providing an accurate view of contemporary society.  It was extraction of themed events and locations that are intended to portray particular period times and places that people find interesting.

I mean, if there's some Viking-themed thing in the US, nobody thinks ""ah, this is means that downtown Stockholm consists of batttleaxe-wielding, long-haired men who go around abducting and having their way with women"".

Of the locations he shot -- which may not even be representative of all theme parks and locations:

* In the US, unusual ethnic outfits that didn't wind up surviving and being popular here play a role.

* In Europe, the Old West, a sort of low-population, lawless frontier environment is of interest.  Something like that hasn't existed in Europe for a long, long time.

So they aren't representative of contemporary society.  They're highlighting things that are unusual, that people might want to see, from periods when there was a great difference from modern times.  That makes sense for a theme park or event -- and there's nothing wrong with that.  If that's what amuses and interests people, great!

736,"&gt; What would it do there?

Peacekeeping, for one thing. If it can protect civilians from the tides of war, then theres much less reason for the civilians to become refugees and leave.

Having a force there to threaten those who would start war can be helpful as well. If a group is scared of how Europe would respond to their aggression, they may be less aggressive.

And, obviously, fighting groups like ISIS would be something for it to do, though we are already doing that individually. 

&gt; European countries already is involved in Syria, because we send 1000s of soldiers to fight for ISIS

To quote the President of the USA, 'wrong'.

&gt; So I suggest that we stay out and let someone else handle it.

Who should we let handle it? America? They really haven't shown the best track record, and they are begining to show less interest in the middle east. They were mainly there for oil before, which is less important now. They don't have to deal with actually living next door to the region.

Russia? Considering that Russia is de facto Europe's biggest geopolitical opponent, leaving them in power seems a bad idea.

Leave them to their own devices? Doing that has let the middle east be in a cold war between Saudi Arabia and Iran for decades. I do think that this cold war will end soon, but not nessessarily peacefully. The only war for the Saudis to win now is being much more aggressive, I think, and so the region could become more dangerous. If they don't do that, however, a peaceful Iranian victory could happen, as Iran is becoming more powerful and Saudi less, due to lack of western sanctions and development in Iran, and the dropping of oil prices for Saudi.",celtic tiger best tiger,/r/europe/comments/7lpur1/swedish_finance_minister_to_asylum_seekers_dont/drpbk9g/,noahk777,1514131066

You need to ask yourself *why* you are triggered.

The hysteria from Europe over our passport is bizarre. Why do you care so much what the British Prime Minister said to British citizens?

Britain doesn't react to stuff European leaders say to their citizens. 

For example a few weeks ago Macron told the French that their language would be the global number 1. Did Britain react by insisting that English would be No. 1? Of course not. Because a) we arn't fussed about what Macron believes and we don't care what he tells his fellow citizens b) we don't care what the No 1 global language is, we haven't even bothered to make English the official language of the UK and c) we're not insecure!

900,"Something shocking that I found a week ago, is a quirk of the history of writing:

The egyptian alphabet used whole figures to represent the figures they were describing (eye for the eye), then they used these figures as letters, where the first sound of the words would describe the letter - only consonants though - then, in mining and other settings where writing brought economical use, a new script appeared, a non religious script, they didn't invent new symbols though, this was just a fancy way of saying that they removed the more intricate details on the letters, i. e. Simplified symbols. It was an all consonant script still. Then Phoenicians imported it, made some adaptations and modified the shape of some symbols (I. E. They used the symbol and changed some details s) to adapt to themselves. From them, the Greeks got their own script, they flipped some symbols because they wrote from left to right, added some few plus they added vowels. That same Phoenician script was took by the Arabs and thus the Arab script began. India did the same and thus the Indian scripts started. The etruscan borrowed the Greek writing and then the Romans borrowed the Ethruscan writing. Plus the Cyrillic script is based on the Greek one

908,"Your distinction is a historical construction made by the British to differentiate themselves from the French. The management of the colonies by the two states was very similar, except for Algeria, which were French departments, not because of political will but because Algeria was inhabited by many Europeans (Spanish, Italian and French). Departmentalisation was set up after these Europeans were important and not before.

The access to independence was not more complicated for 90% of the French colonies, the 20 African states which are former French colonies acquired independence in the 1950s as the British African colonies, by the same legal procedures. Only Algeria is an exception because of the civil war between Franco-Algerians (descendants of European immigrants or descendants of Algerians who have acquired French nationality) and Algerians.

Local languages were never banned, local law was respected, even in Algeria where tribal and Islamic courts remained in place. Colonial societies were then divided in two, on the one hand settlers and natives who wanted French nationality under French law, and on the other hand natives who did not want to become French and keep the old customary rights. All the independence leaders of the 1960s spoke their local languages, they were neither banned nor disappeared. However, they were not taught in French schools (since they were either French or African women who had attended French schools).

This distinction *English colonialism vs. French colonialism* only makes sense for Algeria and is therefore only a difference within the French colonial system. But there is no global difference between the French and British colonies, except that the British had much more settlements and managed to make small Great Britain, whereas making Algeria a French territory failed.

964,"Well, since it's independence what the separatists want, and since it's unacceptable for the Spanish government to change the constitution so that there's a possibility of a lawful referendum, then it actually pretty much makes sense that they tried going for unilateral independence. They really didn't have any other option to achieve their objective.

The fact that they don't have a broad social majority that would be for independence is of course another thing. They however do have a majority in the Parliament.

And yes, the did manage to isolate themselves, but let's not pretend that they were the only ones contributing to that division. PP or C's don't even attempt to come up with some political solution to the problem, they just keep repeating the same phrases all the time, scoring political points. The only party that is at least somewhat constructive is the PSC.

What I think it nuts is the insistence that there can't be a lawful referendum. Even now after all this, the separatists still don't have the majority of votes. The results of the referendum would very likely be no and this would be settled for another few generations.

1000,"&gt; There is no Article 7 triggered against Germany.

No, as I said, because there are still working checks and balances, even if they are imperfect.

&gt; Neither Germany nor Poland joined EU recently.

I know. My point was that Germany gets a bit of a pass here, whereas ideally Germany should reform its judicial selection process.

&gt; &gt; is subject to judicial review

&gt; Stop spreading false information. The German law states explicitly that only Bundestag members participate in election council.

The law that you're referencing is the Bundestag committee that nominates, but *does not elect* the judges of the Federal Constitutional Court. I was talking about the decisions of the Richterwahlausschuss, which is an entirely different institution and which *is* subject to judicial review.

Not to mention that I don't get why it wouldn't be subject to judicial review even if it were a parliamentary committee; the Federal Constitutional Court also has the power of judicial review over the legislature's laws and activities.

&gt; It is not more robust. The counting method used discriminates against smaller parties and thus waters down 2/3 majority requirements. The sittings are also confidential (!) to conceal politicization of candidate choice.

Oh my god. You're linking to d'Hondt, which hasn't been used for Bundestag elections since the 1980s (when it was replaced by Hare/Niemeyer). Not to mention that the ""discrimination"" against smaller parties is too small to matter much for 2/3 majorities; the point of the 2/3 majority requirement is that judges are selected by consensus, anyway.

&gt; You deliberately spreads false information that contradicts BVerfGG § 6 (linked above).

§6 BVerfGG is about the election of the judges of the Federal Constitutional Court and has nothing whatsoever to do with the Richterwahlausschuss, which has its statutory basis in [Article 95 (2)](https://dejure.org/gesetze/GG/95.html) of the Basic Law.

1025,"Anyone who's ever lived abroad knows how difficult it is to integrate or be accepted into another society. But the problem she's referring to is not social integration, this is not a problem per se, but economic integration. Meaning immigrants cost a lot of money, because they won't or can't find jobs and pay taxes. As an immigrant in Sweden it's very difficult to find a job. The biggest reason for this is (1) minimum wage and (2) high taxes including ""national insurance contributions"". 

(1) ""in Sweden the law provides for the right of workers to form and join independent unions to bargain wages collectively, and it prohibits antiunion discrimination."". This means the minimum wage level in Sweden is quite high, adapted to skilled workers (people who already had a job when these wages were negotiated, in part to keep people out of working in their own field). It is in fact so high, that it's difficult to find a job even when you're born here and have completed high school. As an employer you also commit to paying vacation leave for your employees, 5 weeks per year, a cost of 12,72 % of their salary, yearly. Imagine not speaking a word of either Swedish or English, who would want to hire you?

(2) Taxes in Sweden are notoriously high. At least 25 % income tax, 31,42 % national insurance contribution, 25 % VAT by default. Meaning it's very expensive to hire someone. Let's take an example:

You run a medium-sized restaurant.

1041,"I'm tired of explaining how this is not an argument.

1) Population of the islands has never been harmed since the start of the conflict. There has never been one Turkish attack on any of Greece's islands let alone harming the population in Agean.

2) Pogroms are not related to the Agean conflict. Turkish citizens attacking Turkish citizens is none of Greece's concerns regarding the demilitarization of the Agean islands. Plus, you said it was a pogrom. It's an inner conflict of Turkey. There has been one pogrom and except for ""Varlık Vergisi"" the perpetrators of discrimination against Greeks were punished. The 1955 pogrom has nothing to do with Greece not having military in certain Agean islands.

Additionally, the demilitarization is only for the islands that are very close to Anatolia. If Greece wants to protect its people, they can do so from an island that is not banned from militarization. These moves by Greece are solely for expansionist ideals. There is no justification for militarizing those islands. It started as an agitation process from the annexation of Cyprus and has gained the important edge since 2002 and become relevant. 

Imia crisis did not happen out of the blue as well. Turkey had always considered the islet theirs while Greece did so as well. Had that ship not crashed in there, the crisis wouldn't happen. Turkey did not want to start a crisis for expansion's sake.

There is some truth to what he says though. During Ottoman times high Ottoman officials used the word Turk as a bad word. They used to call them things like Esek Turks (which I believe translates to donkey turks). 

And not only that but the the Ottoman Empire in its long history (counting out the last century which was a great decline) had been far more kind to its subjects than what the Kemalist goons turned out to be.

Would be easier with some sort of world refugee fund.  Perhaps funds can be administered by the UN to the refugee population on the ground, helping to stop any corruption with the money.  Refugee host nations can then receive some added incentives from the rest of the world for helping to take on the refugees.

Works for the host country - they get incentives and don’t have to deal with the day to day as much as it is administered by the UN.  

Works for the refugees, they get to live in a safe place with access to funds to rebuild their life in a country with the same culture.

1351,"Devaluing is a better word, debasing is generally used in relation to commodity money.

With active fiscal policy- i.e., lowering taxes and investing in underinvested areas, the recession is stopped. Other than that, I do agree that the labour market should be more flexible with something more like the rhenish or nordic model of collective bargaining instead of national minimum wages for example.

 I assume as many people apply for 500+ as they already can, and during a period when unemployment went up, they would be less able to have children in the first place in any case; in any case, if it actually happened, the increase in deficit would be a good thing.

Also, if you haven't noticed, there are less people but each of them is more productive in terms of output, so output is still rising; an irrelevant point then, even if we were not able to issue debt to pay for it.


Noone 'prints money', the government prints banknotes. Money is created whenever credit is issued, and the government can do that by issuing debt.

Inflation doesn't grow, because interest rates are raised properly and the currency (would) be able to be devalued even more flexibly under a tripartite system. So, even if inflation went to dangerous levels, it could be controlled very easily.

Also, *inflation is not a result of debt*, it is a result of a fall in Aggregate Supply without a fall in Aggregate Demand ('creeping' inflation, caused by structural damage to the economy such as oil shocks), or a rise in Aggregate Demand without a rise in Aggregate Supply- i.e. demand outpacing supply or productive capacity (traditional, 'galloping' inflation; since AD = I + C + (G-T) + (E-I), the government can influence that by increasing its consumption and investment- grouped separately as G, and lower T- if G is more than T, there is a deficit, and in this way the government can make AD higher, and therefore higher than AS, and therefore cause inflation; if there is high private investment and consumption, such as in the 90s during the dotcom bubble, a surplus may be necessary in order to stimy inflation, especially at a given interest rate, but it has nothing to do witht he amount of debt)

The rest is just random heart-tugging emotionality. *The government is not a household*, it doesn't 'save up', beyond a certain point that is _actively bad_ for the economy.

Moderate Muslims have adapted and accepted that you can be Muslim and be American/Canadian/Australian, etc. but that is only because they have decided or learned that Islam and culture and not the same thing.  These refugees grew up in countries where they are, so it is ingrained.  

I think this will be difficult because moderate Muslims immigrated a family at a time.  Adding huge numbers of people at once means they can aggregate together and reinforce a worldview that opposes change.    We saw something similar in our history where bigotry or practice segregated certain segments of the population.  There are areas in our cities (like Chinatowns for example) where some of the older generation don't even speak English because they grew up in a microcosm of their own culture.

As a contrast, my sister in law's family insisted they assimilate.  As a result, they gave all the kids 'Canadian' names and made sure they went to university to become professionals.

I'm American. You're describing the American melting pot. 

This isn't how we do it here in Canada. We don't expect people to integrate. We expect them to live in their own communities like Richmond, Surrey, Brampton, etc. This is multiculturalism and we pat ourselves on the back for being so tolerant. We think that Canada's strength is all of the little ethno-states we have in the outskirts of our major metropolitan centres.

Only Quebec believes what you said. Maybe you're from Quebec? I don't know. I am. And here, you are absofuckinglutely expected to integrate and they have very little tolerance for you if you don't. They also put their money where their mouth is and pay you to go to school and learn French and then expect you to be Quebecois. 

This is our schism with the Islamic veil as well. In English Canada, it's a ""personal freedom"" to do whatever the hell you want - including **NOT** integrating into a secular, liberal society.

In Quebec, that doesn't fly. In Quebec, it has been run as a theocracy until recently. There are women alive today who couldn't even get a divorce. In Quebec, ""Je me souviens"" means a lot of things, including remembering a time where women were treated like shit.

So when we see other women being oppressed by religion, our heart aches for them because we have people here who know that feeling firsthand. And they know what it means to now be liberated. To divorce with ease. To not even have the option of taking a man's name when you marry him. To live in a household without a man with no social pressures or repercussions.

&gt; Our data contradicts the view of some commentators that xenophobia, racism and intolerance were major drivers of the referendum result.

He didn't incite other people with his action, so no. This doesn't fall under article 137 of our criminal law.

1439,"&gt;Why ? Because it is a choice ? And race isn't. How much of a choice it is ? It is affected a lot by your enviroment, your education, your upbringing... things you had no choice or say in. 

People can and do change their political beliefs all the time. If they didn't then elections would be almost useless. 

You cannot change your race nor ethnicity so it's moronic to hate someone for that.

&gt;Do we expect children of 6 to see through neo-nazi ideology now ? Or do we expect them to do a full on change when they turn 18 ? Leave their family and everyone they know ? Do we expect children to pay for their own schooling ?

Of course not, you're appealing to extremes. Hate the Nazis for indoctrinating their kids. When their kids are old enough to have researched it on their own and still decide to be Nazis then yeah, hate away.

&gt;You'd find it easy to change from neo-nazi ideology because you were never one. But think about how hard it would be for you to become a neo-nazi. That is how hard it is for them to stop being it, to become someone like you. (not everyone wants to of course). 

And the entire population of Germany post WW2? You think the people that helped found the EEC were different to the ones that were laying seige to Stalingrad?

I mean there is still a sizeable portion of the German population that grew up under the Nazi party, and a very tiny percent of them believe Nazi propaganda. It's entirely possible to lose your political beliefs no matter how far entrenched.

&gt;Besides changing race is also possible. Micheal Jackson did it.

The fact you said this single sentence makes me doubt any of what you said is serious.

&gt;It achieves nothing though. You can't change someone if you hate them. 

That's not true, I mean yeah it'd be harder, but hating someone doesn't mean you can't engage with them.

&gt;Ah so you have no friends with which you can discuss morality and ethics with unless they agree with you ? It's debatable whether that's a discussion at all considering it's supposed to include an exchange of ideas. It's like parroting really.
&gt;
&gt;Imagine how terrible would a world be if everyone just agreed with each other and nodded at what they  say. And how... unchanging, until we'd all die.

You misread what I said. I said I'd find it difficult to make friends with someone that disagrees so strongly with my political, moral, and ethical points of view. I could never befriend a racist or a nazi or a homophobe, but I could engage with one in discussion any day.

If you this salty about the baltics I dont even want to hear what you would have to say if you lived in Russia. 

btw waiting a few months to see a doctor is pretty common. That is the downside of more inclusive healthcare, often people need to wait if something is not real important and even if it is important some times you need to wait. Even US which has quicker times for the few people with good insurance you could wait months paying lots of money. 

It seems like it is you who has the agenda. I am not sure what your beef is against european society but you arent making any real arguments. You are not disputing the actual statistics that show Latvia is better off than Russia you are making arguments like *I had to wait too long for a doctor and some kid was speaking Russian, and I stalked and you suck!* That is indicative of agenda. 

So I say we can agree to agree Latvia and rest of Baltics are better than Russia, unless you want to specific argument about how Russia is better. Barring that I agree I have an agenda, the discussion of normal economic and societal health statistics. Sorry if this triggers you.

The current way our financial systems is setup / run requires infinite growth of resources (people+natural) in order to be sustainable. Mostly because all money is ""borrowed"" so there is always interest to be paid.

Money has not been tied to a natural resource since 1976. So far the current system has made it 40 years and is badly creaking at the edges ( most countries have nearly uncontrollable dept) which started when the dollar was detached from gold.

The long term effect this has is that a country with 0% population increase actually requires a year on year GDP increase because of inflation. Which is why our monetary system requires infinite growth which is obviously impossible.

Where as a correctly working system should not actually require a GDP increase unless the population rises. Since people typically all consume the same amount per year.",,/r/europe/comments/7lpur1/swedish_finance_minister_to_asylum_seekers_dont/dronv3q/,mistralol,1514081803

it does not speak abstractly of changing the status quo, or of the exact meaning of the concept of majority. it speculates on the outcome of a referendum, assuming that a. people would vote in accordance with their party preference, and, b. what remains of the 47.5%, which is the pro-indy vote, would vote for the union. however, as pointed out in the next post:

&gt; This is assuming all the votes for Podemos-CatComú are votes against independence, which they're not. 

then, b does not hold, and it should amended to reflect the fact that some voters (7.5%) would have kept neutrality. in a referendum like this, neutrality would mean abstention and/or spoilt ballots. hence, it can be concluded that, in the hypothetical that i quote above, secession would have won. 

note that, contrary to your point, in democracy all votes and elections are decided on the preferences of the voters who actually vote, rather than on those of the eligible voters. of course, results may be considered unrepresentative, if turnout is too low, but this is irrelevant to the election under consideration.

1532,"&gt;The real reason people become bilingual is that they use the language as part of their daily life

You're entirely correct. That's why linguistic immersion programs in places like Catalonia and the Basque Country are so important, and so far they have given positive results in promoting the use of our languages.

&gt; I know a case of friends moving to Catalonia and having no interest/motivation to learn Catalan and being looked down upon because of it.

That's part of the problem. It is true that Spanish is also the language of Catalonia and the Basque Country. But it isn't the *only* language. And to outright refuse to make any effort to learn the local language (and be sure many people do refuse to use *any* word in Basque or Catalan, purely for political reasons) is disrespectful to the people who live there.

Almsot everyone speaks English in the Netherlands. But if you intent to move and set up your life there, the least you can do is at least make some effort to learn at least some parts of Dutch. Same here. People think it is different because ""it's all part of Spain"", but that's part of the problem, and the reason why our society is so divided now. 

&gt; I heard some complains about is the feeling of trying to impose regional languages on people living in the region.

Isn't it the opposite though? You're imposing your monolinguism in our bilingual society. 

I've heard many people (non-Basque immigrants usually) complaining that in order to get a permanent position in the Basque public sector you need to know Basque (B2 is required). They talk about being ""imposed"" Basque. But what about the Basque grandpa who has spoken Basque his whole life or his grandson that speaks Basque as his first language? Why should they go to whatever public administration and be *forced* to use Spanish only because you had no ""interest/motivation"" to learn Basque? That's unfair and that's an actual imposition.

1549,"&gt;Scottish kept beating the English back

Anglo-Scottish warfare had pretty much ended by the time period you're talking about.

&gt;the Scottish king of England that ruled from London and with the Westminster parliament and within the legal framework of the English state

He ruled *England* with the Westminster Parliament and within the legal framework of the English state. The Scottish Parliament and governmental system survived the Union of the Crowns pretty much intact.

&gt;until the English mass bribed and threatened the Scottish nobility to accept the Act of Union in 1707.

That's partially true, but you're ignoring the pre-existing pro-Union movement within the Scottish elite, particularly amongst Presbyterians.

You've also completely skipped over the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, which were pretty major events with regards to the unification of England and Scotland.

&gt;After the Jacobite revolt the English systematically destroyed much of Scottish culture leaving them funny speaking Englishmen.

More Scots fought against the Jacobites than for them.

A systematic destruction of Scots Gaelic culture occured for sure, what with the Highland Clearances, outlawing of tartan, etc, but most Lowland Scots were very much on the same side as the English throughout the process. It was more a Protestant/Catholic divide than an English/Scottish one. 

The ""funny speaking Englishmen"" you refer to (although I don't like the phrase because it's inaccurate and a bit offensive) were basically what the Lowlanders were anyway, since they were predominantly Scots-speaking Protestants.

I feel like my country Canada is interesting to look at as far as integration. Lots of people from different areas of Europe flocked here. Half of my grandparents weren't born here, the other half was born here shortly after their parents immigrated.

They didn't identify as Scottish, English or German. My grandmother forgot how to speak German. She cooked some German food but actually ended up adopting a lot of Ukrainian food because that's what many of her neighbours were cooking.

I'm sure things like fighting in the world wars helped establish them as Canadian and strengthen their pride for being Canadian. But it really seemed like they didn't cling to their past, they integrated with their neighbours, they spoke the language and they took pride in their new home, even though some of them lived in what were essentially mud houses for some time.

I love this country so much and we're doing a pretty great job with immigrants.

1597,"&gt;We have treaties with our neighbouring nations. We also have one with Greece that declares the Dodecanese a demilitarized zone.

This could not be further from the truth. The treaty of Lausanne names the demilitarized regions thusly:

The lands around the Straights (Turkey), and around the Evros river (Greek, Turkish or Bulgarian) and the Islands close to the straights, such as Limnos, Samothraki (Greek) and Imvros and Tenedos (or Gokceada, Bozcaada in Turkish) (Turkey). The islands remain demilitarized to this day and both sides agree that they should remain demilitarized. And both countries also have agreed that demilitarizing the border and the straights would be dumb, so there's army there today still there.

As of the Dodecanese, the part of the treaty on the straights (the one with the demilitarizations) doesn't really mention them. Why would it? If you've noticed on a map, they are actually quite far away from the straights, instead the Treaty of Lausanne simply ceded all Turkish claims on the Dodecanese. 

And then Italy handed them over to Greece as war reparations, in a new treaty **that Turkey didn't sign. That treaty** had some provisions limiting the kind of army Greece could have on these islands but it's on **Italy's** discretion. And guess which country is on our side on this? Fucking Italy.

1614,"To ensure integration, you need to have your system function properly, and lets face it if the past resources were not enough, then the resources Sweden can allocate tomorrow for the sake of immigration will not be even remotely what's required

Well, that's at least the gist of what people think it is, when in reality immigrants should integrate themselves, not expect others do that for you, like everywhere else and with everyone else.. I think it's likely that the current 'state of things' is perpetual and that the politicians keep on blaming non-existent funds for integration, while keeping the immigration open to countries proven to be detrimental, for many years, many decades from now on.

I don't know why, but people haven't realized that Sweden might not be the place they were 20 years ago, if you look demographic change, and the one that will take place it'd be most obvious at first glance that it's not the Sweden. And if we look how it's changed, I don't think many people would say it has changed for the better. I don't think Sweden will have the welfare state they have today in 20 years, I wish they did, but they simply lack the resources and the right kind of people to support their welfare state.

1683,"&gt; How can you be so, ignorant is the only word I can come up with.
&gt; 
&gt; Scotland was part of personal union with England since James Stuart, a scottish king became king of England in 1567.
&gt; 
&gt; Wales was gradually conquered by Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, while being raided from Ireland and sometimes by Vikings I might add, in almost 900 years of wars.

I said blueprint for the future British empire and specifically nothing more. British colonial empire became a proper formal empire in its last stage of development, it was an informal trading, influence empire long before that. 

Wales was conquered by force in several campaigns, then the Norman lords replaced the nobility with their own, instituted English language at the expense of the local language, built the castles to permanently mark their territory and settled some English settlers. 

Scottish kept beating the English back so in the end, after the Scottish king of England that ruled from London and with the Westminster parliament and within the legal framework of the English state, until the English mass bribed and threatened the Scottish nobility to accept the Act of Union in 1707. After the Jacobite revolt the English systematically destroyed much of Scottish culture leaving them funny speaking Englishmen. 

Ireland was continually invaded, subjugated and, yes, colonized by waves after waves of English settlers who were given privileged legal and social position over the native Irish. That's in addition to outright wars of extermination against the Irish, most notably by the Cromwell but also by the Great Famine of the 1840s that could have been prevented but wasn't.

Prussia was originally a German colony and it follows New World colonization process pretty well - new settlers came in, genocided the natives and claimed it for their own. However it became an integral part of the Prussian state once it consolidated and once all the surrounding areas were fully Germanized. 

I don't understand why are you being so aggressive with this, either. Is it difficult to accept that Siberia was colonized by the Russians and the Russian Empire? Or that colonies far far far predate 19th century or the middle ages? Were Greek colonies in the Mediterranean not colonies because they're older than feudalism?",,/r/europe/comments/7lm7zd/ww1_before_he_was_assassinated_archduke_franz/drocuep/,nrrp,1514066622

Like there is actually a very significant Cantonese population in the Netherlands who are _actually_ totally not integrated and have their own communities, their own China town which they hang out in, barely speak Dutch and otherwise don't bother anyone.

Everyone is talking about the Turks and Moroccans because they _are_ integrated; they live amongst you; they speak Dutch fluently but often in a weird sociolect which they can drop on command if they want to and switch to Standard Dutch and they harass you. They're integrated, but assholes.

And here's the other thing, everyone talks about ""Turks and Moroccans"" but the reality is that the only nuisance is ""adolescent male Turks and Moroccans""; the older and/or females ones don't bother _anyone_; say what you want about horrible patriarchy but one of the things it does is that it makes females so demure that they're so afraid of being hit by males that they don't dare to speak or bother anyone.

The old people who also don't speak Dutch very well don't bother anyone either.

So yeah, what people are bothered by are the ones who paradoxically enough _are_ integrated and speak Dutch fluently enough to accost you with weird sexual remarks. ""HEY MEISJE, kom jij niet met mij heen hè geile meisje wollah?""

And while you can't see education on first glance I'm pretty sure that most of those are VMBO or MBO students; the ones at the VWO or WO on higher levels of education probably also aren't bothering anyone.

So, this is not about wanting the land back. This gives life to the question: ""Can Turkey take back the islands which Greece unlawfully militarized?"" Can the Treaty of Lausanne be interpreted that way? Does this mean one of the exceptional elements to the ban on the use of force is fulfilled? 

It is a complicated issue like the territorial waters in the Agean issue which Greece and Turkey should rationally solve in bilateral treaties. Because military action would likely end in the favor of the defensive nation.

However, the same schools that teach literature have been giving strong arguments for why his literature was of high quality, and this centuries after, when all the cultural context is lost

Plus, there are many architects who talk well about the way was done in the past and modern architecture is more and more criticized. That Copenhagen bike lane God whose name I don't remember is an example.

Also, not everything has improved. In India new infrastructure has been eroding with rain and people while centenary ones just by the side are surviving. Journalism has obviously not. Because ideology (including art, which is a set of ideologies) isn't related with the technical evolution we're having and there's a million of examples. For example: The modern wider social acceptance is related much more to how the domino pieces fell in the west than unavoidable progress. In Japan they are building super robots, yet they are still xenophobic towards foreigners. In some Arab countries homophobia is still very strong. Let's not talk about democracy. The art of thinking ideologies became more and more refined, but that doesn't talk about the goodness of it. I'll take the most extreme example: Nazism. The ideology behind it is much more evoluted than the ones that preceded it, and yet, it is still very bad - oh, and the context, many Germans at his time thought his was the right one, yet nowadays the little retrospective view that the little time gave us suffice to show that Nazism was a bad ideology. Modern imperialism too had built up on past rhetoric (the book technology) making it very advanced, and yet... 

Many artists arose much later their death because as culture changed a more critics got objective approach to that time frame art, and many artistic works which where pop were unconditionally criticized in future generations.

Then, there's the most obvious case that modern architecture is the same everywhere nowadays. And that's not because it is the best choice : many parts of China, the many parts of India, the many parts of the Arab world, and many parts of Europe had different arts and, the further geographically the more unintelligible one art became to the other. European tastes are closer to the Arab than to the Chinese. All this artistic currents developed separately and for all of them their version was the best. Each city medieval infrastructure is unique and you can recognize them. If I give you samples of cont architecture in different parts of the world, you can't distinguish them. Isn't distinctive an attribute to value for itself?

Yes, but in that case it would be a wrong attribution of the status, that is unlikely to happen

&gt;If someone displaced by war in their home country applies for citizenship or a temporary work permit in order to run away from devastation (without going through government charity programs) are they a refugee?

No, they would be normal migrants, which is a status way superior to refugee


What you don't understand is that the refugee status is not a very desirable one and it's one that is persued by someone only in last instance since it restricts a great deal of your freedom.

It is used in cases of emergency so that you can be accepted in a country in which in normal circunstances you would not be accepted, with that status you are banned from working and only receive a pittance by the government till the situation in your home country gets safe and then you get sent back. 

If there was no European Union and there was a war in Portugal, I would probably run to Spain, but I wouldn't be persuing refugee status because there would be no reason to it cause I would almost certainly be accepted by the spanish government, cause it gives priority to portuguese citizens in their immigration procedures, I would just go as a normal migrant, thats whats happening with Poland and Ukraine.

1809,"&gt;Firstly when a government steps in and starts meddling with private property it violates basic capitalist values.

Same could be said for the communist side as well. Stealing from the people would go against the very principles of the theory. 

&gt;This is why we still have armies though. Because we have tried other approaches and found them insufficient. And if we look at this from a cold hearted perspective we may see that we don't even preach world peace. We preach balance of power and international law. And there is no law without an enforcer. That being the hegemonial powers.

Balance of power exists exactly so it will act as a deterrence in an attempt to establish and maintain peace (at least that's what most powers want). That wasn't the point though. The point was that even though the concept of world peace will -based on our data and experience- surely eventually lead to war, atrocities, genocides etc, it remains a good cause that fails, not an evil one. People don't do the same with the principles of communism, instead they go for ""communism always fails and leads to violence so communism is inherently evil"" which is a bullshit of an equiation

&gt;Debatable. Because there are people, including myself, that find the underpinnings of communisms (equality, class conflict, egalitarianism etc.) to be antithetical to values that to me sound nobler. Values like individual liberty, tradition etc.

That's different. Someone might find your values to be antithetical to values that to him sound nobler but that doesn't mean that capitalism is necessarily inherently evil. You might value individual liberty to an anarchistic extent that might lead to a survival of the fittest kind of society and the other guy might value a limitation of liberties with a focus on the collective progress and well-being of the people in a group. 2 sides of a coin, both might not be perfect and might have ""bad apples"" but they're not necessarily monstrosities.

&gt;The difference is though that had communism had its way I wouldn't be able to even debate my values with you. Because in order for the proletariat to stay in power there has to be a dictartorship of the proletariat. And that is vague in theory but in practise we all have seen the prefered methods used by the ""proletariat""

Again we're talking about the practice as we've seen it and i agree. The dictatorship of the proletariat is as vague as any other new regime i suppose. The difference is that there's a shift of power in classes and in theory it would be a transitional phase. The violence that you mention in the end will exist in the case of a counter-suppression attempt like the one we saw with the Paris Commune. It doesn't promote violence, but it does warn about it. The rich never like to lose what they have so yes, it's expected that there will be a clash. News flash, people died when we toppled Feudalism too. Turned out the outcome was much better. 

Anyway my point was that there is a shitload of people that actually haven't read about the theory (i know you have) and they literally believe that it's a bunch of books written with maiden's blood instead of ink, talking about how communism will take away everything from the common people and will establish a dictatorship (the ""of the proletariat"" matters little cause once they read the word ""dictatorship"" they think it's the same thing) and is promoting an Orwellian state of things. It's not like that though. We know how it HAS turned out many times and yes it was pretty bad but people need to understand the difference between what it says and how it's been implemented. I'm not saying that they should like it or agree with it, i don't agree with the theory in many parts either for the record, but yeah i'm not going to accuse Marx of promoting genocide cause Stalin was a nutjob.

You said not to blame them for being dishonest, for one.

Why would I? Afghanistan has conflicts for decades, despite not in all parts of the country. Would you say it's the same to live in Sweden or in Afghanistan? Why should I blame someone for trying to live in Sweden instead of Afghanistan? 

&gt;And also that THE reasonable argument is Sweden can't handle all asylum requests, implying every request must be acted upon by refusing to acknowledge that denying the request is handling it.

Each case must be handle one by one, since one is different. But in this current scenario Syria is in a worst situation than Afghanistan and Sweden already took several refugees. So it's sensible to argue that should be deported because their situation is (likely) better than Syrians. 

Dehumanising them and showing no empathy for their situation doesn't sound the best option. But well, from reddit I already expect everything when it comes to how to handle refugees.

Virtually no one is told this about Hitler because hey Germany lost the war but the Brits get told how amazing Churchill is who first tried to get Apartheid in England and when that failed successfully managed to realize it in South Africa—but he won the war so he got a state funeral.

Second of all, there are differences between then and now. 

- The American-born population was also expanding at the time, not shrinking.  This helped to keep the local culture and language dominant.
- The German wave of immigration was temporary.
- Successive waves of immigration from other cultures helped pressure integration.
- Germans were fairly similar (in terms of culture and religion) to the British already there.

The situation in Europe has none of these factors. In nearly every European country, the local population is not increasing but decreasing at an alarming rate. The current wave of immigration shows no signs of subsiding, at least in the next 100 years.

2083,"Seriously, people don't learn. When the US sends weapons somewhere, things get worse, not better. Regardless of what you think a conflict is supposedly about. 

&gt;The State Department officially announced Friday evening that the US was going to provide Ukraine with ""enhanced defensive capabilities as part of our effort to help Ukraine build its long-term defense capacity, to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to deter further aggression,""

Like in Syria? Funny Ukrainian ""sovereignty"" matters when it suits your political ambitions, but Syria's doesn't. Syria the country you not only supported the terrorists in, but also attacked with cruise missiles, without getting the green light from the security council.

&gt;The State Department said the ""US assistance is entirely defensive in nature, and as we have always said, Ukraine is a sovereign country and has a right to defend itself.""

Lmao, cool story bro, say that to the Middle East countries you attacked. [All US actions are by definition not about attack; that's how your propaganda works.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmoXze-Higc) Does Bashar Al-Assad in Syria have a right to defend itself? 

&gt;Members of Congress and the US-backed Ukrainian government had long requested anti-tank weapons to boost Kiev in its fight against Russian-backed separatists.

Well duh. It was the US which [helped enact a coup against the prior Ukrainian government](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uNsXEu8ljM), which created this situation.  *(Amazing they make sure Nigel too, is right sometimes.)* To think that was in 2014.

&gt;This is another development from the US that Russia is expected to criticize. Some experts told CNN that Russia could use this move as a pretext to take further action in Ukraine, after its invasion and annexation of the Crimea region in 2014.

Your experts must be pretty low-quality if they can't work out that selling weapons to a country on someone elses border which they're fighting, might piss them off. 

&gt;The move comes amid a recent uptick in clashes between Ukrainian soldiers and Russian-backed separatists, and the same week the Trump administration announced it would permit sales of some small arms to Ukraine from US manufacturers.

Because sending weapons will really help things. Do you plan at all? Or is this like Iraq where there's ""no exit strategy""?

&gt;The statement also said that ""Tillerson emphasized that the US would further support Ukraine.""

Of course. The hallmark of US strategy is to get others to fight your proxy wars. 

&gt;Nauert said the department notified Congress on December 13 that it had approved an export license, which allows Ukraine to buy certain light weapons and small arms from US manufacturers.

Oooh, business opportunities! Wouldn't want to let a good conflict go to waste.

&gt;Following that announcement, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, issued a statement calling on Trump ""to authorize additional sales of defensive lethal weapons, including anti-tank munitions,"" to Ukraine.

Lmao, what a great phrase *""defensive lethal weapons""*. So like... Nuclear weapons too right? 

&gt;""Vladimir Putin has chosen war instead of peace in Ukraine. So long as he makes this choice, the United States and the Free World should give Ukraine what it needs to fight back,"" McCain added.

It's coming from an american that someone else chose war? Man. 

&gt;Nauert had also addressed the conflict in Ukraine on Tuesday, saying, ""Russia and its proxies are the source of violence in eastern Ukraine, and the Russian government continues to perpetuate an active conflict and humanitarian crisis through its leadership and supply of military forces on the ground.""

So you literally accuse Russia ""and its proxies"" of the things you yourself just did? How does that doublethink work? 

&gt;Nauert said the US continued to call on Russia to withdraw its forces and weaponry from Ukraine.

Maybe if you started acting like a normal country and did the diplomacy thing instead of supplying weapons to yet another country, this request would be met. But instead, Russia should withdraw things like ""its weaponry"" after you just started supplying weapons yourself. When has this strategy of yours worked?

The problem here is that they assume that there is only one possible system which can be considered Marxist. Like, there is no single liberal democratic – look at how different Ireland, Sweden, and South Korea are. These countries are all liberal democracies, yet their economies are structured way differently. So why do they assume that there can be only one socialist system? Also, even if we suppose that there was a system which followed Lenin and Marx to the word, but would it be good? Even if somehow the vanguard party is going to stay a workers' party, would it be good?

Movies or series tend to not be completely accurate as they have a set runtime and a certain way of storytelling so some parts of the original story need to be adjusted but physical appearance isnt one of them. Physical appearance doesnt constrict the narrative to need changing.

2169,"There was a great response a few days ago on this subreddit, but lord knows I can't find it. 

From what I remember though, the issue isn't specifically changing how judges are appointed, it's the unilateral assault on the separation of powers itself. I don't think anyone denies that Poland's judicial system needed an overhaul, it's rather with the unilateral way that PiS is going about it, and packing the new court with its people. There's not much of a separation of powers when you've just appointed a bunch of people loyal to your party. 

There was absolutely no cause to replace all the judges, as PiS has done. A number of the judges were appointed legally (I believe two were not, meaning just the final two had to be dealt with). 

Simply put, PiS' actions are an attack on the judiciary, not a reform. If they genuinely cared about the reform, it should've been handled in a much better way, such as through bipartisanship, rather than just the outright assault conducted by PiS. 

Since there are so often comparisons to Germany being made - just imagine a party came into power, and then decided to replace the judges of the Bundesverfassungsgericht with their own people so they could push through whatever they wanted. This is the situation in Poland.

The main takeaway and core of all these stories is how the characters look and what kind of ethnic makeup of a society they represent, not fanciful (leftist) concepts like arrogance, hubris, class, power, love, intrigue etc. and god forbid -a storyline-

Since viewing of such cultural hit pieces on the mind are mandatory throughout Europe, even with brexit, even with the new left wing Austrian government signing up for this, it should at least remind us that white people still exist while we're being clock worked oranged (another movie that would have been destroyed by any skintone other than 'playing too much videogames' white) into pacifism, lowering our spermcount and slowly convincing us women have agency and don't have to drop out at least 2 white babies in their life time.

People travelling was extremely rare at that time, trade was very local. 

&gt; Now it's highly debatable what the ethnicity of the average Egyptian was, but it's pretty much certain there were black people among them.

Egypt is not in Turkey. While the Eqyptians subjugated and used the Nubians, the near East didn't see a substantial amount of black people until Arabs started enslaving them en masse many centuries later.

&gt; Considering how much trading was being done in that period, yes, it's quite possible there were black people present in Troy, if it even existed.

There was trade with the near East, very little with most of (modern) Turkey.

2298,"&gt;They should hold a referendum on independence and if they get a super majority 66.4-70% they get to declare independence and EU recognises them.  

Why stop with, 66%?  Why not ask for a 99%? \s

Whenever you ask for more than a 50% on a referendum, you're basically accepting that the votes on one side count more tham the votes on the other. In this case, a Pro-union vote would count twice as much as a pro-independence vote.

Needing a supermajority to change something is a way to help maintain the Status Quo.
It could help it's porpoise of stability in the sort term, but could mean a huge instability in the long run.

If you don't believe me, just imagine the kind of problema derived from having 60% of the population voting in favour and the other 40% against (a 1.5 ratio), but still remaining in Spain no matter what.

The clue ia not supermajority, it's a long political campaign to convince citizens about the benefits of each option.

But to do even a referendum (which, as most people understand, is the only way to solve this) the Spanish government should be willing to allow it (not the case) and the Spanish Constitution should be reformed by a 66% supermajority (almost impossible).",Valencian Country,/r/europe/comments/7lgqms/catalan_poll_result_a_defeat_for_spain/drnmo9t/,Xaurum,1514023942

2385,"Assume, for a moment, that populations are happy to remain where they were, assuming that the carrying capacity of the land is also fixed.  That seems very unlikely to me: you can find countless instances of economic migration around the world, and it seems extraordinary to me that immigrants to Europe would be of a unique nature.  But, let's run with the argument.

That is, if we go with the author's thesis, migration will be produced by global warming.  This means that there has to be some carrying capacity which is being reduced by global warming.  People don't want to leave: global warming is compelling them.

I will believe that there is some effect of this sort.  Some people who would not have left will leave due to global warming.  I don't know what this number is.  But I can confidently say that, at least in Africa, births will play a larger role than global warming.

Births must greatly outweigh any effect of temperature change, no matter how extreme the impact of temperature, in that no matter how much temperature might decrease the carrying capacity of land, it cannot be by more than 100%,  and population projections show increase of over 100%.

That may not hold true of, say, Bangladesh, which is crowded and very low-lying and will be one of the more-heavily-hit places in global warming, but where TFR is at around replacement rate.  But for most people, I believe that it will be the case.

I've seen some number of political figures talking specifically about temperature.  So I'd assume that there's some significant political basis for it.  I'm assuming one of the following reasons holds:

* Having an argument about births sends the conversation down a politically-awkward path: once one starts deciding how many births someone ""should"" have, one is in very dangerous waters.  Global warming is more-comfortable.

* Global warming is a popular political topic that people can identify with.  Every generation has its crusade to ""save the world"".  There are no communists (or capitalists, depending upon your bent) to fight.  There are no demons, for most in Europe: secularism dominates.  Besides, religion is a difficult crusade in a pluralistic society.  Moral decay is normally an enemy of the right, not the left.  There are no great wars.  The world is now mostly made of countries practicing one form of democracy or another: democracy is not threatened.  Every generation will have policy presented to it as it interacts with their crusade, to give it meaning.  If you want to send subsidies to corn-farming states or to car manufacturers, best to present it as part of The Great Crusade.  And so it could just be the standard ""present this in terms of the current political fight"" tactic.

* Lastly, identifying global warming as a cause of migration could create a sense of obligation — if one makes a mess, surely one is obliged to clean it up.  If one burned coal, then surely one cannot turn away people impacted by coal.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7lk3mb/high_temperatures_are_already_sending_refugees_to/drnkfsy/,vokegaf,1514017317

2412,"People who believe Nordic unification is even remotely possible more often than not have never been to Nordic countries, let alone more than one of them, or they are just ignorant of the facts.

Look, let's just put the most obvious facts and figures out there, and the problems they bring:

Military:

NATO: Norway, Denmark, Iceland - yes, Finland, Sweden - no.

Conscription: Norway, kind of yes, Sweden and Finland yes, Denmark no (iirc, correct if I'm wrog), Iceland doesn't even have a standing military.

As for Finland, our support of NATO membership is around 20%, opposition 60% (20% uncertain), and support for conscription 84%.

Monarchy: Iceland, Finland - no, Sweden, Norway, Denmark - yes

EU: Norway, Iceland - no, Finland, Sweden, Denmark - yes.

Currency: Finland, Euro, Sweden, swedish krona, Iceland, icelandic krona, Norway, norwegian krona, Denmark, Danish krona. Despite 4 of them using kronas, all of them are different currencies. Sweden and Denmark have no plans to join the euro either.

Then there is 5 different major languages, one of which, Finnish, is even on a complete different language group to the other.

Then we have other legality related issues, listing them here would take 6 years in law school and another 6 years of writing down. But just to name a few; Different drug laws, education systems, healthcare systems, prison systems, taxation, social welfare systems, immigration and refugees, I could go on.

We do have one thing that unites us, unfortunately that would be also our downfall. Hatred of Sweden. 

Now I'm gonna say straight out that you would not be able to convince 330,000 Icelanders to be ruled by 10,000,000 Swedes even with a nuclear threat. 

They would lose their voting power, hell, even Stockholm has like 3x the population of Iceland, and they would be directly affected by every decision they make. Which in this century, undeniably there have been few bad decision made by Sweden, so bad in fact that it has become a sort of meme. Do everything the opposite of what Sweden does.

Which is the problem. Sweden is overall fine, hating them is just in our bloods, but having such high population compared to other Nordic countries and such different political climate, asking us to unify with them is a bit absurd.

Which brings me to visiting Nordic countries. I've been to Sweden 4 times, Åland once, Estonia 5 times and have lived in Finland for my entire life. If I'm honest, in my eyes Estonia is closer to Finland than Åland is, and Åland is autonomus region of Finland, half swedish half finnish about that. Let alone Stockholm and Sweden as a whole, which is absurdly different to Finland.

Everything about our countries is just on a completely different level. We share a similar history, sure, but unfortunately that history is from my point of wiev rather negative. Afterall, we were ruled by Sweden for a long time, then by Russia until we gained independence from them in 1917. 

100 years of glorious independence and fighting Russian imperialism, one of the most patriotic nations in the world (highest % of males who would fight for our country), yet you expect us to throw all of that away, just so we can get fucked in the ass by gender-gay Sweden? No thank you. 

This idea is probably less popular in Finland than implementing 1945 Soviet Union style socialist dictatorship or uniting with Russia. At least Russians aren't pussies. Except when they're fighting against us. Pussies.

But in all fairness, I would rather consider uniting with Estonia. We're close friends, they have cheap alcohol and construction workers, and they are our only neighbor we can stand. Plus, their standard of living would raise significantly, which is a good thing. And we have common enemies too.

&gt;or the denial of human rights prior?

What human rights were denied?  

&gt;Why does an accusation (no actual proof btw) of organ harvesting justify the literal rape and ethnic cleansing of hundreds of thousands of Albanians?

Source that ethnic cleansing, since barely over 10k people died in the war, and all the refugees on the Albanian side returned, while most of the Serbian refugees were irrevokeably banished from Kosovo.  
&gt; Why do you keep bringing religion into it as well? 

The KLA was guided by religion, thus attracting human rights advocates such as the Mujahideen, Al Quaeda and such.  

&gt;With all that said, I think Crimea should be apart of Russia and Kosova apart of Albania. What are your thoughts?

That the Albanian education and state is as low as i expect them to be.

2487,"Did you really compare the WW1, WW2 and century of european conflict with a colonization conflict create ex-nihilo by the west in 1948?

I just remember you Israel should never exist in the first place if you only take account the right of self determination

There is only ONLY ONE reason Israel have the legitimity to exist: : Israeli live in these land since more than 75 years, majority of them borned and raised on this land. Any other argue is lie, bigotery, far-right bullshit.

Arabs had plenty of valuable reason in this time (1967) to hate Israel and want to see the destruction of this colony like any other western colony in arab world in these time (just remember 60th was the period of decolonization, and lot of arab country get their independance only few years before the 1967 war by making ... war against settler).

I understand Israël have to justify their existence by religion or use (with lot of cynism and disrespect for the victims) the genocide and anti-judaism (arab are semitic so i dont use anti-semitic because it's etymologically incorrect) to shut down any rational judgment on the situation. But it dont make these argument valuable.

Anyway, it dont erase the sad truth :

- Israel is born on the suffering and blood of millions of natives who never ask to be invade, deportate, humiliate, stolen and discriminate by stranger since 1948 and until today (because it's what ""proto-israeli"" was in 1948 and for some years after the creation of Israel, they was stranger, invader, mass murderer like west european settler who invade the entire world was during the colonization era) .

Almost every american country is born by violence and barbarism against native.
It dont prevent USA or LATAM country to exist.
It dont prevent american country to admit the reality of the native american suffering since the XVI century.

One day, Israel and his population will admit what they did and still doing, and will try to fix what they can (just try, not success, because it will be hard to erased the past and the hate of native against them, but it's possible like South-Africa and Mandela prove it). 
This day, and only when this day will happened, a durable peace in this region of the world would be possible. (other solution : they can kill almost every native like in America but i'm not sure it is possible in the modern world, sadly for far right israeli)

So, if you cant see the difference between the german lost territory at the end of WW2 and the palestinian-israeli issue, i cant do nothing more for you sorry.

2566,"&gt; career diplomats 

We're not going to get one of those. We're not important enough. 

Important countries get career diplomats, as it's important that the relationship is not screwed up by some incompetent fool who needed a reward. Shitholes also get career diplomats, as being posted there would not be seen as a reward anyway. 

But postings in small, unimportant, but relatively pleasant countries to live in, those are rewards. It's basically a well-paid job to go live lavishly in a foreign country for a while. There's nothing in the Netherlands an ambassador could screw up - we're not going to declare war on the US after all, the US doesn't really need us all that much, and any international decisions of any importance like e.g. trade pacts and sanctions are all made on the EU level anyway. It doesn't matter. The US ambassador could spit in the King's face and nothing would happen. I don't think we'd have the balls to even kick him out for that. 

So the President appoints somebody he wants to reward. This isn't new with Trump either, it's a longstanding tradition. I doubt that the American administration ""wants to communicate"" anything, except that we're unimportant, but that's not new either. Trump just likes this guy (they seem to have a lot in common) and gave him a cushy post. 

By contrast, Russia gets a proper experienced diplomat. You don't want someone spitting in Putin's face. You need somebody competent and so someone competent is sent. ",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/7lg7qg/the_new_us_ambassador_to_the_netherlands_shows_he/drndm2s/,marinuso,1514003460

Your beloved Sweden has multiple minority languages and dialect differences that make the US look homogeneous, a higher percentage of immigrants than the US, and more people percentagewise who grew up entirely outside western civilization (black and Hispanic Americans mainly follow white American and Iberian culture, respectively, and almost all speak either a Germanic or Romance language. Aside from skin color the US is less diverse than France or Belgium and comparable to Sweden. 

As far as the benefits, if you keep out Sunnis until the current crisis dies down you have people who actually will love and respect their country (immigrants to Canada are often more patriotic than Canadians and British Hindus and Sikhs are more likely to identify with the United Kingdom than English or Welsh are), you have people who with commonsense policies will pay into the welfare state for 5 years without drawing any benefits beyond healthcare (subsidizing the indigenous population), and if they integrate you can move to a healthier population pyramid. A system in which many immigrants are self-employed (the Czech Republic for instance) will actually create jobs on net for the natives.

2646,"&gt;Every even the most cruel regime with time transforms into gray, stupid mass of bureaucrats who create new bureaucrats and so on. And it changes this regime quite a lot from what it originally was.

Perhaps.  I'm less certain that there is a single norm to which societies inexorably converge.  North Korea does not look very much like the US.

But let us say that there is.  Certainly I'll buy that there are some pressures towards systems of society that work well.  Maybe internal reformers would slowly change things.  It could take quite a while.

I'm reminded of the speech from [*Judgment at Nuremberg*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_at_Nuremberg), where some judges that had participated in trials in the Nazi justice system were themselves on trial after the war, and one is speaking about his reasons for going along with the Nazi system:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGfHkdR3tXs

&gt;Janning: I wish to testify about the Feldenstein case because it was the most significant trial of the period. It is important not only for the tribunal to understand it, but for the whole German people. But in order to understand it, one must understand the period in which it happened.
&gt;
&gt;There was a fever over the land, a fever of disgrace, of indignity, of hunger.  We had a democracy, yes, but it was torn by elements within. Above all there was fear, fear of today, fear of tomorrow, fear of our neighbors, and fear of ourselves. Only when you understand that can you understand what Hitler meant to us, because he said to us:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;""Lift your heads. Be proud to be German. There are devils among us, communists, liberals, Jews, gypsies. Once these devils will be destroyed your misery will be destroyed.""
&gt;
&gt;It was the old, old story of the sacrificial lamb.
&gt;
&gt;What about those of us who knew better, we who knew the words were lies and worse than lies? Why did we sit silent? Why did we take part? Because we loved our country. **What difference does it make if a few political extremists lose their rights? What difference does it make if a few racial minorities lose their rights? It is only a passing phase. It is only a stage we are going through. It will be discarded sooner or later. Hitler himself will be discarded -- sooner or later.**  The country is in danger. We will march out of the shadows! We will go forward. FORWARD is the great password.
&gt;
&gt;And history tells how well we succeeded, Your Honor. We succeeded beyond our wildest dreams. The very elements of hate and power about Hitler that mesmerized Germany, mesmerized the world. We found ourselves with sudden powerful allies. Things that had been denied to us as a democracy were open to us now. The world said, ""Go ahead. Take it. Take it! Take Sudetenland! Take the Rhineland! Re-militarize it! Take all of Austria! Take it!""
&gt;
&gt;**And then, one day we looked around and found that we were in an even more terrible danger. The ritual begun in this courtroom swept over the land like a raging, roaring disease. What was going to be a ""passing phase"" had become the way of life.**

That's surprise that internal reform didn't happen sooner than it did.

2835,"The Jewish people are not a random population which suddenly appeared out of the blue. It is true that more settlers arrived in the era of the British mandate, but this people has a long standing relationship with the region.

A case can be found in recent history, putting it in a different light. Kosovo. There are reputable historians who state that Kosovars were still a minority in the mid 19th century. But now the Kosovars are de facto sovereign with backing of the Western world. An important factor in this decision were instances of war crimes committed by Serbian groups, which led the West to conclude that the Kosovars deserved their sovereignty.

And then the West, by force, made sure of it.

So it is my opinion that a claim to a region and to sovereignty is a mix of many things which all contribute to make it valid.

&gt;I don't see them not having it in a united secular state or in a two state solution. 

If you were able to reasonably proof this I would support your viewpoint. But I find it as of now not convincing enough. And since the survival of an ethnic group is in the balance there is no room for 'good enough'.

You can also point out how Native Americans were the real owners but now immigrants are ruling the land, yet other wrongs don't make this right.

And sorry but, an immigrant group doesn't have to be the majority in a land they came after. Gypsies can't also do that just because they're prosecuted still.

The truth is that a lot of those actually stayed, and a lot of the expelled remained, the last inquisitorial process against crypto muslims was in the late 1700 (making this more than 1000 centuries of explicit islam in the peninsula at this point).

Something similar happened with jews in Portugal, where some families retained crypto judaism up untill today.

So long story short, what happened to muslim iberians? A tiny minority was expelled to northern Africa but thr huge majority of them remained and fused with christian communities effectively getting integrated in various different waves (some as early as converting during the mudejar period ==&gt; muslims living in Christian territory pre 1492, and the lasts at the late 18th century), and here were are, you and I, now.

2910,"Scotland is more or less exactly the same as England when it comes to Christmas, but a bit different when it comes to New Year's. 

Advent starts on December 1st, but nothing really happens until Christmas Eve, except the decorating of the house with Christmas tree etc, which happens any time during December, usually a week or two before the 25th. 

On Christmas Eve, we sometimes have a special meal, and those of us who are Catholic go to midnight mass (which is not actually at midnight anymore). Then sometimes children open one of their presents early. Then various Christmas eve games can be played, such as putting a letter to santa claus in the fire so it blows up the chimney and reaches the North Pole, and snap-dragon, which is a game that involves putting large raisins in brandy, setting the brandy on fire, and then trying to eat the raisins without getting burned. Most people don't play this anymore for obvious reasons but we still do it in my house.

Then on Christmas day you go to church in the morning and open your presents after (most people just skip church these days), and have christmas dinner and watch whatever Christmas movies/specials are on TV. Usually there is a special of a popular soap opera such as Eastenders, in which something always goes wrong on Christmas day resulting in someone getting killed or injured. 

The Christmas meal is goose or turkey with a Sunday Roast, except with sprouts and pigs-in-blankets. Dessert is Christmas pudding, which ideally should be set on fire and carried into the room with the lights off.

And then people play games, and pull crackers, and enjoy their presents, and drink a lot of alcohol, and argue with family members. Anyone who doesn't wear the little hat from the Christmas cracker at the table for the entire meal is shot at dawn on Boxing Day. 

Technically Christmas ends on January 6th which is when you take your Christmas tree down, but for most people here Christmas is seen as over by the time New Year's Eve rolls around.",,/r/europe/comments/7l353g/european_christmas_cultural_exchange/drmqrke/,CopperknickersII,1513972339

3197,"No, actually it is not. The UK one has no strings. The German one is not allowed unless under very specific circumstances, which I think is quite good in a way. You cannot acquire German citizenship without giving up what you already have as a non EU citizen, unless it was taken away from you during the Nazi regime.

&gt; 1. If the other citizenship is that of another EU country or of Switzerland. Non-EU- and non-Swiss citizens must usually renounce their old citizenship if they want to become German citizens. There are exceptions made for citizens of countries that do not allow their citizens to renounce their citizenship (e.g., Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica. P.S.: In case of Brazil it is possible to renounce your citizenship through a requirement made in the Brazilian consulate if you already have acquired another citizenship voluntarily, but it is not required to do so; the following jus-soli countries allow renunciation only if the citizenship was acquired involuntarily by birth there to non-citizen parents: Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Uruguay), or if the renunciation process is too difficult, humiliating or expensive (e.g., Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Cuba, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Morocco, Nigeria, Syria, Thailand, Tunisia, USA), or, rarely, in individual cases if the renunciation of the old citizenship means enormous disadvantages for the concerned person.

&gt; 2. If a German citizen acquires a non-EU or non-Swiss citizenship with the permission (""Beibehaltungsgenehmigung"") of the German Government (e.g., existing relative ties or property in Germany or in the other country or if the occupation abroad requires domestic citizenship for execution). The voluntary acquisition of a non-EU or non-Swiss citizenship without permission usually means the automatic loss of the German citizenship (but see Point 4). The permission is not necessary if the other citizenship is of another EU country or of Switzerland or if dual citizenship was obtained at birth.

&gt; 3. If the person is a refugee and holds a 1951 travel document during naturalization.

&gt; 4. If a child born to German parents acquires another citizenship at birth (e.g., based on place of birth [birth in jus-soli countries mostly of the Americas], or descent from one parent [one German parent and one foreign parent]).

&gt; 5. Children born on or after 1 January 2000 to non-German parents acquire German citizenship at birth if at least one parent has a permanent residence permit (and had this status for at least three years) and the parent was residing in Germany for at least eight years. The children must have lived in Germany for at least eight years or attended school for six years until their 21st birthday. Non-EU- and non-Swiss-citizen parents born and grown up abroad usually cannot have dual citizenship themselves (but see Point 1).",,/r/europe/comments/7lhaa6/brexit_was_never_about_blue_passports/drmeejh/,ben50100,1513958482

3209,"&gt; Judges are appointed by Goverment in Sweden too btw

No. They are appointed by the principal authority in charge of the courts of law in Sweden, not the Justice department (Justitiedepartementet) and not by the government (Regeringen). The minister of Justice cannot personally promote judges or do anything that interferes with the autonomy of the authorities (Myndigheter) subservient to that particular department that he is the head of. To do so would be considered Ministerial rule (Ministerstyre) which is strictly forbidden according to the instrument of government (Regeringsformen). The only thing the minister of justice can do is set the *agenda* for his department, nothing else.  Your claim is 100% false, and if it was true even remotely Sweden would probably be under similar scrutiny as Poland right now, which it isn't.

Are you just pretending to not understand on purpose now. Blacks being 7% of the population doesn’t change the fact that another group, that makes up 44% of the population, they are a minority. Being a minority in your own country is something that we will see in America by 2050, and most of Western Europe by 2100, at the very latest, probably earlier going by the figures. Are Arabs even close to being a minority in the UAE? (Ignoring all their spaces or course) Are Koreans even close to being a minority in their country? Are Japanese people even close to being a minority in their country?

Why do we have to take in millions of migrants, but these countries, all of them rich and well off just like Western Europe, get to have their own nation? This victimhood and white guilt culture is ridiculous. You think the Japanese, Arabs, and Koreans never had Empires? 

Why is it our responsibility but not there’s?

3267,"&gt; No, you specifically said that each seat should be won by electoral circles.

No, I haven't but anyway I'm not interested in cherry picking arguments. 

I don't defend systems like US where the party that wins a state elections gets all seats but I do defend that regions with less people are slightly more represented in the elections. 

&gt; The main problem that rural areas face is that it's much more expensive to create infrastructure to cover those areas, in relation to how many people are going to benefit from it. Urbanization is going to continue, and rural areas will become even less populated. Trying to change that by investing obscene amounts of money for very little gain is ultimately just stalling the inevitable. It only makes sense that cities should get most of the attention, since the cities will have much greater need for infrastructure investments in the coming decades.

If you could spend 5 billion euro to create a railway, would you build it somewhere where half a million people would use it or somewhere where ten thousand people would use it?

Of course. It is natural that bigger cities will grow faster and rural areas will fall to desertification. And from a management point of view is better is people are close to each other. 
However we must have in mind that people aren't machines and they do have feelings. While for someone in their 20s or 30s is easier to move to a big city, older people don't have the same willingness and already have their roots settle their. The issue isn't about investing as much in rural areas than in bigger cities but rather adjust the attention and create platforms to help people who live in less developed areas. Which I think many countries don't do it. And since in many cases all they need is to convince high dense areas, the rest gets ignored. I don't hold a PhD in political science but I do think that this was one of the issues that lead to Brexit or Donald Trump. When people feel ignored, they turn to the anti-establishment.

Because politicians in Western Europe think that there is still hope for Poland.

It might be unpleasant to hear for people in Hungary, but this is at the core of the different treatment that the two countries receive.

When the multi-speed Europe comes, Hungary will be in the lowest of low speed tiers. 

From the point of view of EU politicians and Western European politicians, Poland was supposed to be at the very core, the innermost tier. There was a key role foreseen for Poland but the country refused it, choosing navel-gazing instead.

And the Commission has tried to convice the Polish government to change its course, yet they ignored them.
What more can the EU actually do?

&gt; Each and every country in the EU has its quirks and red lines. In the past, the EU knew better but to push and provoke unnecessarily. When the Dutch and the French voted against the Constitutional Treaty, nobody said ""oh fine, let's kick them out of the EU and move on without them"". When the Irish voted against the Treaty of Nice, nobody said ""kick those ungrateful potato-eaters out of the EU""

How is this even remotely comparable? Did France, Netherlands and co. break any rules by giving the referendum? Or did they break the rules because the population didn't vote in favour?

A few years afterwards, we got Geert Wilders, who has now been going strong for a decade. He needs to be protected 24/7 and he sleeps in undisclosed safehouses to prevent his assassination. This is how dangerous it is to call out Islam publicly over here.
* Anti-semitic and homophobic incidents have increased exponentially in big cities, the perpetrators being almost solely young, 20-something Muslim men. There are a couple of Jewish schools in Amsterdam, that need to be guarded from time to time, because of threats. For Jewish people in Amsterdam, wearing a kippah (spelling?) in the streets has become a living hell due to harassment.
* Instead of, y'know, arresting actual criminals, Dutch police have taken to making surprise visits to people that tweet or post facebook posts critical of Islam. 
* I am friends with a girl that volunteered at the largest refugee camp in the Netherlands (Heumensoord, closed two weeks ago because of large-scale problems). She told that about half of the 'refugees' are 18-22 year old males from Algeria/Morocco/Tunisia, subsaharan Africa, Iran/Pakistan and other countries where there is no war. These young men are under the impression that they'll receive a free car, a free house and a job when they arrive, and because that's not happening, they are growing impatient. They simply didn't believe her when she told them that they will not get a free car/house. Meanwhile, some are even returning to their home countries because of these 'dissappointments'. Others are complaining that the food is not 'good enough' and that the Wi-Fi is too slow. 
* She also told a story about how a Syrian man was caught beating his wife by the guards. So they separated the man from his wife for some time, as a cool-down. The man was enraged about this and climbed into a 20 meters tall pole, sitting there for hours, demanding that he could continue beating his wife.

3394,"Nope, lots of countries do. Specifically, countries that don't have a bureaucracy for monitoring ambassadors.

Basically, because ambassadors normally only report to the president/head of state, who is a person that just doesn't have the time to deal with drama around ambassadors, there's no oversight. Unless they screw up massively, anything an ambassador does simply won't make it to their boss's desk - and even if it does, their boss is often too busy to care about finding a replacement. Thus, even garbage ambassadors usually stay ambassadors until their term is up.

And that's *before* getting into when a government doesn't care enough about a country to bother trying to find the best candidate for an ambassador. Like in this case: the US government has no big reason to care about the Netherlands, so they just gave it to a no-experience-in-being-an-ambassador Republican politician that helped them out in the past.","Irish, living in Denmark",/r/europe/comments/7lg7qg/the_new_us_ambassador_to_the_netherlands_shows_he/drm4vr0/,LtLabcoat,1513944114

3469,"&gt;Eliminating tax evasion.

The ""common control file"" (JPK) is a development they only finished, not started. Though the VAT evasion fix with ""reverse"" VAT is a partial success, I agree. Partial only ,because the ""great success"" that gov showed is only creative accounting by Morawiecki, real gains are much smaller.

&gt;Nationalising of large bank to have influence on Banking market.

Nationalization and goverment trying to control markets are a good thing now?

&gt;Further development of LNG terminal as well as starting program to build pipe to Denmark.

That's true about the pipe, but terminal was already opened by PO.

We'll see about pipe though, for now it is mostly on paper/in it's infancy. Hopefully this works, as the LNG terminal is in a long term not economically viable (too expensive to buy gas this way)

&gt;Increasing internal consumption along with social program (famous 500+)

This works, indeed. It is the kind of social reform that was long needed.

&gt;Investment in industry.

? Where?

&gt;Starting plans and research on Central Airport program.

It is a pipe dream for which is little to no point - previous govs also considered building it ,but economical analysis does not support its creation. SO they did not start research - it is already there.

&gt;Unemployment dropped to level we did not had since communism.
GDP raise is closing to 4%

This is not their achievement, but the result of global economic situation. Contrary to popular belief in Poland - government doesn't have that much of a say in it, except maybe for very drastic policies and destabilizing political situation which might drive some investors away.

So it is more despite their rule.

3643,"D'Hondt method is at its essence simply a method of assigning seats to parties according to the number of votes they have. It does not have by itself anything to do with circles. It works like this: You tally all the votes of all parties. The most voted party gets assigned a seat, and you update their vote total to be half of what it was. Then you look at all updated vote count and assign another seat. You keep doing this, dividing the number of votes a party has by the number of seats it has earned plus one. For example imagine the House of Commons has 3 seats and the results are as follows:

* Labour - 300 votes
* Conservative - 110 votes
* Liberal Democrats - 50 votes

We are going to assign the first seat: it goes to the most voted party. Labour just elected a MP. We know update our tally to be like this

* Labour = 300 / (1 seat + 1) = 150 ""votes""
* Conservative = 110 votes
* Liberal Democrats - 50 votes

Assigned seats: 1 Labour

We are now going to assign the second seat. It still goes to labour has it has the most ""votes"". We know update the tally to be like this:

* Labour = 300 / (2 seats + 1) = 100 ""votes""
* Conservative = 110 votes
* Liberal Democrats = 50 votes

Assigned Seats: 2 Labour

Conservative wins the third seat as their number is highest. If there was a 4th seat we'd update the tally to be like this:

* Labour = 300 / (2 seats +1 ) = 100 ""votes""
* Conservative = 100 / (1 seat + 1) = 55 votes
* Liberal Democrats = 50 votes

And Labour would elect a third MP.


An electoral circle, or constituency (I think thats the term in the UK) is a geographical division which is apportioned a number of MPs (in the case of the UK, one, which goes to the most voted candidate). Instead of D'Hondt being applied to the entire vote, it is instead applied to each individual circle, and then the MPs elected for each circle form the new parliament.

For example in Portugal we have 230 MPs. Lisbon elects 41 MPs, Porto elects 39, and so on. Inside each circle MPs are aportioned according to the D'Hondt method applied to the votes of the voters of that circle.",,/r/europe/comments/7lbvg1/live_results_of_catalan_parliamentary_election_as/drlw8bi/,nao_temos_so_deveres,1513923408

Yugoslavia was deeply unkown territory for the West ever since the Cold War, there was little know about how severe the situation actually was. It's not like we're talking about longtime core members of Europe. If there was a similar war in the Benelux, then the point might have been more valid. 

And though Yugoslavia was a true modern horror story, to say that it was genocide is simply not true. It was just medieval tribal warfare but with AK47's. To put it the most direct phrasing: there was too little organisation in the killings to call it proper genocide. If there is any continent that hasn't learned jack shit, than it's the Arabic world that hasn't undertaken any action in Syria or even continued bombing and blockading Yemen even though it's population is systematically dying in their fight for independence, radical as their views may be.

3728,"If Britain had remained we would have vetoed any idea that led to further integration. To be honest this idea is not sustainable.  The EU needs reformed, at the moment it’s in this weird limbo with half-baked integration (monetary union without a fiscal union) with a large democratic deficit. 

Apologies, I was primarily referring to the idea of military policy. If we had remained and joined and formed one military what would have happened to our overseas territories? What if the Falklands was invaded and the UK wanted to sends troops to defend it but the rest of the EU said no? This scenario could occur whether unanimity or a majority voting was applied.
I prefer the concept of NATO. Sovereign nations having direct control over their own forces while contributing to a budge, and if the EUs plan is similar to this then what’s the point if we already have NATO? Plus we have America if all else fails.

&gt;Whether Britain has an emotional attachment to the idea now is irrelevant. If it can be shown that the UK will financially benefit from being part of EU integration

That’s the thing, the majority Brits do not care if we economically gain from integration if we feel like our sovereignty is being undermined. If the remain campaign had come out and said that the prospect of further integration was coming soon then leave would have won by more votes. It’s not a pragmatic response and is emotional but people vote due to emotions all the time.

I don’t know why the idea of integration is repellent to us but I just know that it exists.

1) Immigration being favoured on the left is a modern progressive approach (except classical fringe Socialist movements).

2)  You have to ditch the shitty one dimensional spectrum everyone loves and switch to a multi where right-left = economics.

Catalan language needs reinforcement in school. Outside school, Spanish has too much strong presence (90% of cinema is in Spanish, 80% of TV, 99% of videogames, etc.). So, if it wasn't for school, many Catalan kids wouldn't be bilingual. And Catalan language is important if you want to work in Catalonia.

As a Pole, I find your distress about current events very comforting and I hope this will continue in case our nation will ever need any external help like Ukraine did.

Now back to the matter at hand - TVP, national television doesn't need propaganda to reach its audience. Just a positive or extended description of events is required, as said audience already agrees with current media's and political agenda anyway. Even though the news titles are retarded, they too are somewhat related to what majority of voters feel with Germans and UE always negative with regards to the changes Poland wants to impose upon its own legal structure.

What's really worrying is that people are divided and accept arguments of both sides without a shadow of doubt.

Opposition is currently organized around vocal and influential parties that held the power over Poland for last couple of years. Their media channels impose opinions and agenda directly opposite to what is shown in national TV, which is what their audience expect as well. The problem is that such information is delivered in such a way that forces the viewer to feel that his rights are somehow violated, democracy is in danger and all of the changes imposed by the ruling party should be in direct conflict with one's own inner belief. People start to feel seriously cornered about things they never knew about before just because it's showing opposition in a better light and makes it easier to inform people abroad that world is about to end.

Some time ago my friend from France called via Skype to check if I'm alive because ""all of these protests and police on the streets"" were shown on TV and it really looks like Turkey with no democracy and UE imposing stuff.

I'm like...wut? Nothing has changed, there's nothing out of the ordinary happening apart from heated media conflict which further drives people against each other. 

Until some time ago I knew there might be people living in caves that just watch TV, while having obscure opinions about social, legal and political changes but due to aggressive manipulation and fear-mongering in main national and private TV channels people started to hate each other for absurd reasons or randomly saying things like ""Kaczynski is sick from hatred, he should be hanged"" or ""I'd hit this fucker in the face for what he's doing with our rights"" or ""Tusk is a traitor to Poland"" etc.

So it's not that straightforward to say that nuclear is superior to renewables, certainly not in terms of cost.

The US can contributed the lions share of historic cumulative carbon emissions they're individually responsible for 0.18 degrees warming, while China and India are responsible for far, far less. They're also one of the wealthiest countries in the world (wealth they gained through burning cheap energy) and the second biggest emitter.

Furthermore your confusing two concepts, when we talk about the events that took place in the fall of 2015 we are mostly talking about refugees or people under subsidiary protection. As opposed to immigration (even though many immigrants have arrived since but certainly not millions and millions!). 

Secondly the European Union is important for right wing economics since it provides the necessary freedoms of movement for goods and workers. Seen in that light accepting many refugees into the country back then might actually be consistent with right wing politics.

The refugees where mostly already in Europe or on their way there and the Dublin agreement would have them stuck in poorer EU member countries near the borders. Since refugees have a legal right (again, as opposed to immigrants) these countries would have had to deal with them. And even if they were to deport them that would have been a huge crisis and economic burden for say Greece. Ignoring the Dublin agreement relieved the pressure at the time and allowed the market to function.

Ever since her government has introduced the “Asylpakete” restricting rights and also immigration (which back then was part but not all of the people). Also she’s initiated shady deals with foreign governments (most notably Turkey) and her government has declared many unstable regions “secure” so that they are not obliged to provide certain rights to people fleeing or emigrating from these countries.

If you just look at the few weeks in 2015 without any context her decision seems in line with left leaning parties but the whole of her politics in that sector is not and generally she is still conservative, anti-environmentalist and economic liberal.","United Europe, United People",/r/europe/comments/7lafgw/the_states_of_the_european_union_by_the_european/drl97lz/,vglcl,1513893246

Do you know who Stefanie von Berg is? She is a German politician who publicly announced that she wants all major German cities to have a white German minority in 20 to 30 years time. That is the lunacy that scares the Eastern Europeans away from the EU. The refugees will never stop. Even when there are no wars, there will be economic migrants and even wealthy migrants who will prefer life in Europe and the company of white women to their home regions. Refugees are the tip of a titanic iceberg - just look at the estimated African population growth for this century. Refugees are predominantly male, hence a perpetual influx will result in gender imbalance. Many white European women will abandon their men to have relationship with the African and Arab immigrants, leaving native European men single and childless. There are some people like me who believe that white women, like Katheryn Winnick, are really beautiful and that they should at least be preserved in Europe, as opposed to all of us Europeans amalgamating with immigrants and turning into Africans in terms of appearance. There are too many western Europeans who boisterously claim that they don't care if every white European woman marries an African immigrant, ""as long as humanity prospers"". I don't feel that way. I do not share that view. I believe the physical appearance of whites is worthy of preservation in our native territories.

As far as I know, you are already having a gender imbalance problem there in Sweden. Perhaps you already have a partner and don't care about this problem, but your sons and grandsons will have to deal with the problem. I can see it already - in a Swedish club, 30 years from now, you have 2 white, rare blonde women standing by the bar. Around them there is a circle of 20 intimidating MENA and African men with leather jackets, hands in their pockets. A white Swedish man enters the club and tires to approach the white women. One of the MENA/African men flashes him a switchblade. The white Swedish man backs away and exits the club to go watch pr0n in his apartment. Nice...

4154,"Here we go. 

You're american, so you'll always misunderstand, because you ultimately take personal offence to anything which critiques the US, which in turn makes you become defensive and thus we're back to the low-brow US culture of debate where it's blue against red, instead of a more balanced and/or truthful perception. Hence why nothing gets done in your country, because any disagreement of any import makes people blow up, as you nicely demonstrated. 

I'll try to reply super shortly, because I know this won't go anywhere. 

&gt; It was the primary nation behind the UN, WTO, IMF, and World Bank. Which is why 3 of the 4 of those bodies are HQ in Washington.

At least 3 out of 4, which are simply arms of the US government to coerce others with. As seen for example through IMF voting power.

&gt; It is the primary enforcer of decolonization, Neutrality of the Seas,Space,and global commons

Despite it itself colonizing using more than 700 bases and also either not ratifying important treaties/accords or pulling out of important ones. Most recently Paris climate agreement. Meanwhile threatening countries with its gunboat diplomacy which you think is right because ""might makes right"". 

&gt;Has Bilateral/Organizational Defensive pacts with Every Major Democracy in the world from Japan to Germany, The Primary Currency Backer of FOREX and reserve currency. A Founding member of NATO,OECD,OAS, and APEC. 

Which simply means it has more control and can do just what it wants, as it did on many occasions. Hence rogue.

&gt;How can the country that established the norms of the current global order be rouge state? 

Yes, you cannot imagine can you. Perhaps [you should pay more attention in the future.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_state-sponsored_terrorism)

&gt;When Iran blockaded the Strait of Hormuz in 2011 that was rouge in nature, stopping all shipping in the region. It was the US who normalized the situation by sending in the fleet and breaking the blockade.

And it was also the UK/US which created the Iran we see today, by toppling their democratically elected leader in 1953. Hence precipitating a lot of the conflict in the Middle East today. With zero consequences legally. But of course you think the US is the hero here.

&gt;Just now in the Korean Peninsula, it is North Korea firing missiles over Japan and testing nuclear weapons, this is a rouge action. The only reason Japan and South Korea have not acquired nukes themselves is because the US has promised total defense with these nations. 

And the reason that conflict is still ongoing, is likewise the fault of the US. It didn't want to negotiate with NK for example and has frequently forced NK into going the nuclear route; not least because the US terrorised Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan and other places for free. Of course this is forgotten, so you can say the US is simply defending. The classic american story.

&gt;When Honduras faced a coup d'état 2009. And the OAS unanimously imposed sanctions on the nation till democracy was restored it was US sanctions and the threat of a second invasion, first was in the early 90's. If President Zelaya was not restored and new elections held. 

Yes, [the coup the US was totally not dealing with](https://www.alternet.org/world/35-countries-where-us-has-supported-fascists-druglords-and-terrorists) Number 16.

&gt;Even natural disasters like the 2004 Tsunami,2010 Haiti earthquake, or 2014 Ebola outbreak; required a huge US response as it has such assets stationed around the world which other countries do not, such as 1000-bed hospital ships, LCAC hovercraft and V-22 Ospreys. 

Boohoo, this has got nothing to do with the main question. Other nations help too you know and foreign aid makes up next to nothing of US GDP. But this is another classic american trope: the idea of the US being so generous helping out. 

&gt;One Cannot be a main pillar of the global order and a rouge state at the same time.

Only in a narrow understanding is that the case. Being a central pillar merely means the US has more leeway to destroy international law. Where's the sanctions for destroying the Israel/Palestine peace process for example? Done unilaterally. Or for stepping out of Paris and UNESCO, which undermines your entire climate argument? Or how about firing missiles at Syria unilaterally? All illegal and acts of a rogue state. Now the world is waking up to how much of a pariah it is, since more and more people can see, thanks to Trump especially, that the emperor has no clothes.

Maybe one day you'll realize the US creates problems and then goes in to fix them in a PR-stunt that US media can then report on, so that people like yourself will think the US is a force for good, when it isn't. Speaking of which, [where's the punishment and condemnation for supporting ISIS?](https://medium.com/insurge-intelligence/secret-pentagon-report-reveals-west-saw-isis-as-strategic-asset-b99ad7a29092) ",Switzerland,/r/europe/comments/7kzsyr/us_will_be_taking_names_during_un_vote_on/drl2otn/,Firemex,1513886360
4155,"Maybe I was too young back in the 80s, but  I'm always having the feeling that even in Western Europe the press tend to spread facts instead of oppinions in that time. Now your ""news"" only depend on what side of the politics you are on. 

Obviously it's not as extreme in Germany as in Poland, but you usually get your standard oppinion fix with series like ""Tatort"" where the evil guys are in many cases Nazis who kill helpless and friendly refugees. Or you just watch the Tagesschau where you can usually win any game of bullshit bingo with headlines like ""courageous protests against right wing"", ""afd did something evil/stupid/both again"". 

I think news that were not so 110% clearly based on manipulating the masses would be so much more effective. And I don't get it why there isn't any ""neutral"" magazine/TV station out there any more. I have to watch BBC or read NJ Times just to get a freaking unbiased overview over things. 

Just to make things clear: I'm not saying that there are no protesters or that the AfD isn't a bunch of stupid idi**s.

Mainly because a lot more voters participated, in fact its an all time high with 68% or something.

However one of the largest increase of voters seem to be in Barcelona - which makes half the population of Catalonia and is generally against separatism. 

Another reason why this would be different is there wasnt the Junts pel Si-coalition before the campaign phase. In the last election the separatist parties got together under the banner of separatism and literally spent 2 years doing nothing other than pushing that agenda.

Tl;Dr Switzerland expected to keep her access to the EU's stock market after some new system is put in place in 2018, as we fulfill all requirements, and other countries such as Australia, Hongkong and the US have already been guaranteed permanent access. The EU has now announced that we'll get temporary access of just one year. Most likely to put pressure on Switzerland for some unrelated negotiations. 

Which is allowed and fine and all when it comes to international relations. It's just, y'know, not very nice. Not something you'd expect from friends or partners. A bit backstabby considering our government has just made concessions in good faith that the Eu would reciprocate, ignoring pressure from the right.

And most importantly, the EU might just be shooting itself in the foot with this. These negotiations they're pressuring us about will likely be put to a referendum.

4315,"[Beforehand, sorry for the extremely long and terrible but mainly cringe narration] 


Once upon a time, England and France were fighting each other, violently


""Mine is king"" - England

You may ask, what is king? What are they fighting? Are you drunk OP?!

""No FRENCH is the king of complicated languages in europe (among official languages)"" - FR

There you go, that's the context of the brawl:who to crown king of the hard languages in europe. To be clear, their was a simple fight, with normal punches, etc. Something you'd see in movies about the 30s of new york in the metro (the context of all normal fights that doesn't have a rap song background basically)

""Haha, dear France, your language contains many idiosyncrasies in it, from spelling to redundant grammar, but it lacks the subtleties of English grammar at high levels"" while giving a pretty strong punch in the stomach.


""Look at these cute guys, :)"" here it comes,it's German, you could easily tell the level was upped significantly, as it looks like he came out of a d&amp;d lvl 20 character sheet.

""I actually have 4 cases still, the free word order that it brings, irregularities and idiosyncrasies to mach both. Oh and three genders"" 


With quick slashes, he reduces both brawlers to pain

""I-I- I've never seen such prowess before, you must be the hardest language by far"" France

""Not so quick"" Greek, camera lowers so that the Greece make a cool shadow and perspective with the sun which is conveniently behind him. You can clearly see he came from a lvl 20 d&amp;d. While German had a big magical axe and heavy armor, Greek had a rounded shield, a 1hand sword and light armor. [OK this is getting really cringe]

""As many cases as you, but here in an actual language we have to decline many more words""

And there it goes, their d&amp;dy battle going on, for most of it it looked like a stalemate, but after a while German clearly had a slight edge

German:    
""While, yes, a more casesy language makes it slightly stronger than one less, there area other parameters that can potentially overshadow the caseomania, I've easily beaten French and English but because of a large edge cases gave to me, but also because I'm a combination of idiosyncratic and irregular, you are too orderly, Greek""

""I've 6 cases..."" The recognizable Russian voice touched German's back,

G:  
""As I said, cases while it makes it harder it has been overblown how harder it is""

R:
""... And irregular writing, and many irregularities in grammar""

This convinces German to look at his back. Shock. He felt the game was upped out of his league. Russian looks like it came straight out of DragonBall.

A series of peewee sounds (the fast movements sounds of DB) later both greek and German felt massacred. Just in the time of the last blow, descending from the sky, with an epic background sound, FINNISH arrives, blocking the final blow, a mild smile gets printed on its face, and a second later, on Russian's. [Yeah, now it's getting really cringe]

With a marvel style tone of humour, Finnish says:

""So, we are once more in a war, huh, how many times has been now?""

F:
""I've a dozen of cases, though they are not cases proper like in your Indo-European languages, more like a strange form of suffixes that convey meaning. Also vowel harmony and some other crazy strong and weak pronunciation shit""   
He also came from a DB, it seems like.

*Many peewee later ""

"" Tt-heir power... Is impressive "" Greek says to German

"" when I saw German, I thought it was sooo impressive, so inconceivable... For me, this is something so out of proportion that no vocabulary has been invented for it ""-English

Greek and German look at the first the pair to fight, the ones who thought their naive punches was sumptuous, thinking that they too were once [20 min ago] that naive 

Suddenly, a loud noise, followed by a loud laugh

"" Hey it's me, Polish"" everyone looked at the downmost tip of his feet, not for disrespect, but because it was what it could be seen, because he was Big, how much you ask? Polish was one of the galaxy-shuriken throwing robots from Gurren Lagann. 

""W-h-aat are your grammar rules?"" F

""Huh, funny, my grammar is ever-so-complex, yet it does not understand what the word rules mean"" Everyone of the six fighters, overshadowed, immediately understood that they were dealing with the embodiment of irregular grammar: Polish. 

""Anyway, my grammar has seven cases and I have a gazillion of sh and ch sounds"" 

""I'm going to destroy the Europe planet you're resting your feet on"" just as he was charging his kick, another huge Gurren Lagann person appeared. 

""Hi""

""Who are you?"" Shouts Polish, surprised, but not scared. 

""Basque"" 

All the six small fighters scream in unison
""Basque!!!"" 

""I've heard tales of it, could never believe its reality""


A battle of unprecedented scale followed. Just as it seemed that basque was going to win, narrowly

""Stop!"", A figure of small stature screamed that word,shorter than everyone in that field, shorter than the small six. 

The bravery of this small figure was taken by the laughs by both Polish and Basque. As it looked like that mysterious figure wouldn't give up his serious face, Basque said, calmly

""Alright let me one step kill you so you piss off"" 

""Before you die, what's your name, kiddo, so that I can give a proper goodbye"" 

""*Hungarian*"" 

. 

.


. 

It's hard to describe what followed, as it was too fast, but let's say it ended up with *Hungarian* Covering everything with in a ultra destructive white aurora,but himself and up to a meter below of the ground he was standing. 


Everything was turned into non-existence, except himself, his clothes, and the rock he was standing on. Oh he is *Hungarian* and oh if he was the Supreme God of the languages in europe. 

After destroying everything, he chose to rebuild the universe, but this time, in the way he wanted to.

Not nearly as common as in Spain.

&gt;  Neither do I see what this has to do with identity. Most of you are catholics and catholics aren't predestinarians.

On the contrary, one of the reasons why the Spanish Catholic Church, which was one of the driving forces in the Counter-Reformation, reacted so heftily against Calvinist predestination is that it saw it as an all-too-familiar ""Muslim"" concept. But the fact that official Catholic doctrine is against predestination does not mean that Spanish folk culture, even among deeply pious Catholics, isn't imbued in fatalism.

There is evidence, in fact, of Muslims living among these tribes (paywall), meaning that Hungarian Islam could predate Hungarian Christianity. Are you listening, Viktor?

Right, so [some Muslims lived in Hungarian territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6sz%C3%B6rm%C3%A9ny), therefore Hungarians were Muslims? That's not how it works! At all! They were [pagans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_mythology) and [Tengri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengrism)!

4375,"&gt;  Because usually when americans say this, it means he wants some background checks so that mentally unstable poeple don't get firearms...

And when euros think this, it means they have no clue how firearm purchasing actually works in the US. We have background checks. The mentally ill, domestic abusers, and felons cannot legally buy guns. The gun show loophole is a myth, it simply doesn't exist. The only way you can get a gun without a background check is in a private sale, which the government has no way to enforce anyways without a registry (and being German, you should realize the dangers of a firearm registry) and it's still illegal to privately sell to someone you know can't legally own a gun, or to sell across state lines. 

No, the endgame of gun control advocates is total abolition of civilian firearm ownership. Total disarmament of the population. Somehow the same crowd that screams about how oppressive Trump is and how dangerous the police are fail to see the irony in handing all physical power over to the police and government.

This is also why ""assault weapons"" are so frequently vilified by the media despite rarely being used in crimes and killing far fewer people annually than baseball bats and fucking hammers. AR-15s are the most popular rifle in the US and by banning them and similar rifles you disarm a shitload of people.

&gt; The Most Litigious Countries in the World
&gt; 
&gt; With a growing number of lawyers every year, lawyer totals are on the upswing in numerous countries. According to the American Bar Association, there are currently 1,116,967 lawyers practicing in the United States, which relates to about one for every 300 people.
&gt; 
&gt; Here’s a list of countries with the highest number of lawyers per capita:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. U.S. 1 lawyer for every 300 people
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Brazil: 1 lawyer for every 326 people
&gt; 
&gt; 3. New Zealand: 1 lawyer for every 391 people
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Spain: 1 lawyer for every 395 people
&gt; 
&gt; 5. UK: 1 lawyer for every 401 people
&gt; 
&gt; 6. Italy: 1 lawyer for every 488 people
&gt; 
&gt; 7. Germany: 1 lawyer for every 593 people
&gt; 
&gt; 8. France: 1 lawyer for every 1,403 people
&gt; 
&gt; While it’s true that the U.S. has a large number of lawsuits crowding its courts each year, it barely cracks the Top 5 of most litigious countries in the world.
&gt; 
&gt; In his book, “Exploring Global Landscapes of Litigation,” Christian Wollschlager notes that the litigation rates per 1,000 people shows that European nations top the list of the world’s most litigious countries.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is a list of the top 5 most litigious countries by capita:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Germany: 123.2/1,000
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Sweden: 111.2/1,000
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Israel: 96.8/1,000
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Austria: 95.9/1,000
&gt; 
&gt; '5. U.S.: 74.5/1,000
&gt; 
&gt; The Top 10 also includes the UK (64.4); Denmark (62.5); Hungary (52.4); Portugal (40.7); and France (40.3).

I don't like that they think it's OK to shit on anyone who doesn't think like they do, but I can understand the sentiment. I can also agree that like many countries we have issues with corruption and political nepotism. But how in the duck does letting politicians have _more_ and more direct control over judiciary help that? Would you want an SLD politician fire court officials by the dozen? Would you want judges career prospects hinge on  whether SLD politicians have some issue with him that they don't need to clarify?

4666,"&gt;Whats the alternative?

Tbh original suggestion by the president or kukiz (not sure which one was first) that judges in the  National Council of the Judiciary should be appointed with 3/5th approval votes sound kinda ok to me. Problem is that they quickly turned it outside down and not it is a parody of itself. Or you can make a system where each club in the parliament appoints same number of judges or you can have elections like in US (not a fan of this but still better than what we get).

&gt;Everywhere else in the world they seem to be doing ok with systems where politicians chose judges in different degrees.

Problem is that we are comparing apples and oranges here. There are established democracies with high political class where certain behaviors would not be tolerated. What works in Sweden or UK would not necessary fly in countries like Poland. 

&gt; In an organization of 28 countries, you either punish every member for breaking a specific rule or no one.

This kind of thinking leads to complete negligence of the law. So if EU let Poland go today how will they be able to enforce law tomorrow if say Slovakia do something against the rules? They will say but Poland was let go freely so you can not punish us. And next time some other country decide to go rogue they will say , nah can punish us as Slovakia went free. You seem to suggest that we should dig all the old cases and at once start prosecution against all of them or drop all future cases.

By having an entity that cleans it out, but it doesn't have to be the government.

Things like an independent commission against corruption which has powers to investigate and sack judges would be sufficient. You just have to get the political element out of it. Such an institution has to be at least as independent as the judiciary.

I think that both are bad. Since I do not like judges being appointed by politicians I also do not like them being appointed by just one party.

&gt;That is irrelevant, in our system people voted and it turned out PiS has majority,

I think you are omitting the context here. In an abstract yes you are right. But this was a response to a comment that ""this is what Poles vote for"". And this is wrong. Poles did not vote for it.

4849," Do these your politicians have a connection with the mafia? 

Explanation. When russia allowed Ukraine to reexport gas it was a pretty easy scheme. 

Gazprom selled Ukraine gas for price 150$ and Gazprom selled one Ukraine company controlled by GAzprom and Russian mafia for 50$.

Putin said that they made huge subsidiary for Ukraine. But indeed all this gaz for 50$ was use for reexport to Europe and money from it was landried with help of Austrian Hungarian and Switzeland firms. Some of that huge profit was used for bribe to Ukrainians politicians, the other for bribe for Europe politicians. 
That is why now mr Firtash is arrested and uSA want him to send to USA and Europe is doing everything to stop the extradition. Firtash was the key manager from russian mafia boss Mogylevich in all that firms. 

So if they allowed reexport for Serbia. they want to do something like that. russian do not change schemes of money laundry",,/r/europe/comments/7kz8f3/serbias_vucic_seals_kremlin_summit_with_gas_deal/drk5lvj/,alexs1313,1513836945

The host countries have decided, Council of Ministers (where each host government is represented), that they let the Brits stay if the EU citizens can likewise stay in the UK.

Again, reciprocity, the principle [which you yourself supported.](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7l2ysn/eu_says_final_brexit_trade_deal_will_be_along/drj81qs/)

So the justification (which you asked) for EU citizens to get ""special treatment"" in the UK is that UK and EU member countries have decided a reciprocal deal, that Brits can have same ""special treatment"" in EU host countries.

That is an argument for their advice in interpersonal relationships that remain the same no matter at what point in history we are. It does not pertain to geopolitical decisions.

In the experience of older people, war delivered wealth and glory at a small cost. We shouldn't have followed their lead then.


Besides, right or wrong doesn't matter in democracy (or parenting for that matter): the point is that those who are affected by the laws should be the ones deciding about them.

I never said they should; I just said that judicial independence is fundamentally weakening the rule of law and that that is fine; there is such a thing as too much rule of law and too much democracy and those things are weakened and compromised because the ultimate extreme of rule of law is a robotic state I described with no humanity left and the ultimate extreme of democracy is democratic mob rule.",,/r/europe/comments/7l0zkp/rule_of_law_european_commission_acts_to_defend/drj366c/,my_honour_demands_it,1513792432

Anecdotally, I speak Spanish and have had a lot of contact with Spaniards in Iceland as a tour guide. I was always puzzled by their misconceptions about winter in Iceland. For one thing, many think there's constant darkness for weeks or months, which is certainly not true at Iceland's latitude (we're too far south to have polar night). The other thing is they'd simply project the dark and cold conditions to their Mediterranean lifestyle and imagine it would be terrible, without considering how the culture may have adapted alternative ways to socialize (more indoors). I've frequently had to explain to the Spanish that winter is actually a very active and social season and not some sort of country-wide hibernation.  
  
Personally I love the winter here. After the endless days of summer, I welcome back the darkness. It lets me enjoy cozy times at home with friends and family.

We do not always eat our national dishes for breakfast lunch and dinner. My favourite would have to be halász lé(River Fish soup) and my least favourite is szilvás gombóc(dumplings filled with plum). A lot of people don't agree with me on that last one, but I just don't really like it. And answering your last 2 questions as one: I love a classic British breakfast. It's like a perfect start to a lazy day.

I like to think that we are in central Europe and that's geography correct but and politics say otherwise.

I don't really notice obesity in my country but you can't argue with statistics.

For the younger generations English is a language that you have to know. you can't really make progress in your life outside of your home country if you don't speak it. I speak it quite well as you can see from my writing. I'm frequent in England so my Hungarian accent doesn't really come though. Most Brits think I'm from a Scandinavian country based on the subtle changes in my tone when I speak (and I'm really not embarrassed about it). Before I learned English it sounded like speaking while having your tongue in the back of your mouth. I like English it really simple compared to Hungarian but the fact that it is not phonetic (the word phonetic isn't even phonetic).

My opinion about Hungary's past and future is that we are bad at wars and now we're on a slippery slope to getting kicked out of EU funding.

We learn about British history in school but only the things that had the biggest impact to other counties or big changes in it's political system.

As I said I lived in England for a few months and the only stereotype I formed is that British people have bad teeth. Really guys, step it up with the dental hygiene. But I don't have any problem with the Brits.

Like all Eastern European countries Hungary...

That actually hurt a little but it's true. We are probably the most prejudiced county. A study was conducted: alongside gypsies, migrants and gay people we hate an imaginary nation the most (because people didn't know what that was and because of that, they were prejudiced and said that they didn't want them in our country...)

Being gay accepted socially and culturally, but I can't really speak for it because I'm strait. 

The ""pretending that sex doesn't even exist"" thing is a relatable.

Feminism is present but fortunately there are no radical feminists.

Brexit is bad move in my opinion:
'I wan't a divorce' - exclaimed Britain, loudly. 'But do you want to be friends with benefits?' - It asked, softly.

The *'fara í víking'* (""go *'in'* viking"" (it's a noun, not a verb)) you're talking about, probably referred to a journey by ship long enough to have a shift of rowers – i.e. a long boat trip (no specified purpose). A lot of such journeys may have been raids, but it's a deductive fallacy to just assume the word itself meant raiding. 

The 'viking' you find in contemporary English was introduced during the 19th-century romanticized viking revival, at which point it did refer to ""noble"" raiders. But the term has been broadened to refer to seafaring Norsemen in general (even ones who settled abroad) which is why Oxford's contemporary English definition now reads:

&gt; Any of the Scandinavian seafaring pirates and traders who raided and settled in many parts of north-western Europe in the 8th–11th centuries.

There is nothing pointing toward the original Old Norse word meaning raiders/raiding, and it is not what it means today.

I really don't think so. In summer people here are more sociable. You can hang out outside and go to the beach. In winter everyone just wants to stay at home.

Really? That's interesting. It think that in Finland Summer is considered the most romantic season. It's warm and light and you can wear light clothing and party outside through the whole night.

5635,"&gt;Vitamin D insufficiency affects almost 50% of the population worldwide. An estimated 1 billion people worldwide, across all ethnicities and age groups, have a vitamin D deficiency (VDD). This pandemic of hypovitaminosis D can mainly be attributed to lifestyle (for example, reduced outdoor activities) and environmental (for example, air pollution) factors that reduce exposure to sunlight, which is required for ultraviolet-B (UVB)-induced vitamin D production in the skin. High prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency is a particularly important public health issue because hypovitaminosis D is an independent risk factor for total mortality in the general population. Current studies suggest that we may need more vitamin D than presently recommended to prevent chronic disease. As the number of people with VDD continues to increase, the importance of this hormone in overall health and the prevention of chronic diseases are at the forefront of research. VDD is very common in all age groups. As few foods contain vitamin D, guidelines recommended supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable upper limit levels. It is also suggested to measure the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level as the initial diagnostic test in patients at risk for deficiency. Treatment with either vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 is recommended for deficient patients. A meta-analysis published in 2007 showed that vitamin D supplementation was associated with significantly reduced mortality. In this review, we will summarize the mechanisms that are presumed to underlie the relationship between vitamin D and understand its biology and clinical implications.

&gt; If everything continues as it seems to, now - they will probably win the next elections fairly (but they already changed election law to suit them, and also to make falsifying the elections easier. For example so far if you crossed 2 rectangles on a voting card - the vote was counted as invalid - so you couldn't make a vote for A seem like a vote for B. Now if you completely fill some rectangles and cross another one - it counts as vote for the crossed one - easy to change votes from candidate A to candidate B. 

According to the ne law a vote to be considere valid need at least two lines crossed within the rectangle by the name of the candidate. Some people say about some possible different signs. But actually, it was meant to allow votes which were ""corrected"" in some way so in the effect there might be more than 2 lines crossing within the rectangle (one by the other). Accorfing to the so-far law such votes should be considere invalid.

&gt; They also introduced a new commision to check whether the elections were fair, that will be elected by the ruling party (previously it was part of the judicary system, and people working there lasted many elections to be independent of the current governmetn).

As far as I know the electoral commission will change during the next term of the Parliament (not during this term). Morover, opposition parties are supposed to nominate majority of its members. At least that's what I heard.

Voici l’histoire d’un modeste festival féministe qui a déclenché une tempête nationale. à l’origine de la controverse, les réseaux proches du Front National, dont son trésorier Wallerand de Saint-Just, exigent d’Anne Hidalgo maire de Paris, qu’elle agisse contre ce festival «interdit aux Blancs». Avec une précipitation déconcertante, la première magistrate proclame sa volonté d’interdire la tenue d’un tel festival dans des locaux subventionnés par la Ville. 

The journalist and activist Rokhaya Diallo explains for her the need for non-mixed media (NDLR : *non-mixte* in French means no men and no white people) to combat inequality and achieve the emancipation of discriminated minorities. This is the story of a modest feminist festival that triggered a national storm. At the origin of the controversy, networks close to the Front National, including its treasurer Wallerand de Saint-Just, demanded that Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, act against this festival ""forbidden to white people"". In a disconcerting rush, the first magistrate proclaimed her will to prohibit the holding of such a festival in premises subsidized by the City.

If you ask trade economist, you will see that trade has started to grow slower and slower, that is because after the initial move from one equilibrium with little trade to a new one with a lot of trade, there won't be any big gains from trade.

 - win elections to get single majority (over 50% of parliamnet seats = no need for coallition) with 37% of votes because of quirk of election system (5% threshold for parties, 8% for coallitons, many small parties didn't get to parliament so the rest had more seats than votes)

 - rule during a global economic boom, so they can pretend giving lots of money to everybody and lowering the retirement age when Poland faces demographic catastrophe in few decades is a reasonable economic policy (hey, it seems to work now)

Thanks to that they are quite popular with people who don't care about politics, security, or long-term future. They promised to give money and they gave money. Thanks to that most people don't care what they do with judiciary system, or that they break the constitution.

|They have around 40% support, but no opposition party even comes close. The opposition ruled for 8 years straight (unheard of in Poland), mostly during a global recession, and they did lots of unpopular moves (increasing retirement age and equalizing it for men and women, temporary increasing VAT by 1 percentage point).

So, PIS can get away with a lot and still have support, so they take over everything they can while their support lasts. Breaking the constitution and increasing state control over judiciary system, changing election law to suit them better, increasing control over media and NGOs, and producing the most revolting propaganda I've seen in public media since 1989. Oh, they also have support of the Catholic Church because of alliance with controversial but popular among hardcore ""catholics"" associated with Radio Maryja and TV Trwam. And they use anti-EU propaganda to deal with pro-EU opposition, basically ignoring  foreign policy, just using it as a tool for internal politics. And they are quite anti-intellectual, praising ""regular Poles"" vs ""wykształciuchy"" and ""łże-elity"" (semi-educated and lie-elites).

No wonder they have big support - they give away money and tell the people that had no luck in life that they are great and it's all the fault of a conspiracy of elites.

5988,"&gt; French president calling someone about that ?  

Nope. French president is answering to Syrian dictator about that.  

&gt; The same France that were AQ airforce in Libya?

That's a lie: there was no Al Qaeda force in Libya before Gaddafi's death. Benghazi rebellion was not Al Qaeda.  

&gt; The same France that was arming renamed AQ in Syria?

And, another lie: France armed independant rebel forces in Syria as well as Kurdish forces. Not Al Qaeda.  
Meanwhile, Al Assad is the one who started it all by bombing his own population, he's the one who released from his jails ISIS thugs and sealed a non-agression deal with them to counter-fire both the Independant Rebellion and Al Qaeda. Later, Al Qaeda became the stronger opponent to Al Assad by crushin the Independant Syrian rebels, that's how they took their weapons. 

&gt;  The same France that didnt bomb ISIS oil trucks before russian intervention?   

Oh! Another lie! Color me surprised! France wasn't involved in Syria until 2015 and terrorists attacks in France. Before that, France was only involved in Iraq. And after that, 90% of French actions in Syria were specifically targetting French terrorists.   

&gt; The same France that broken int laws by bombing Libyan forces without permission from UN?

What did you just say?  

&gt; The same France that turned Libya into slave market economy while before they were one of the richest countries in africa?  

Maybe you should open some history book or something before making a fool of yourself: https://muslimsinafrica.wordpress.com/2017/11/20/slave-auctions-in-libya-and-the-need-to-restore-islamic-values-professor-hussein-solomon/  

&gt; The existence of Libyan slave markets however also raises deeper questions regarding Arabism and Islam in Africa. The Arab slave trade of Black Africans occurred over a longer period and involved more slaves than the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Moreover, reports of the existence of slavery in countries like Mauritania and Sudan periodically surface.  Beyond slavery, the arrogance of Arabs in their interactions with Africans was self-evident as the historical record will demonstrate. For instance, in Sudan, the local languages of Borog, Berti and Maal were all transplanted by Arabic. In the process, the sense of identity of these local communities were forever lost. Indeed, Omari Kokole convincingly argues that the twin forces of Arabism and Islamism worked to disintegrate other social and tribal groups operating in the same space.[1] Setsuko Tamara is even blunter in his assessment that  `the contacts between Arabs and Black Africans have been largely asymmetrical, in which Arabs have penetrated Africa, enslaved Africans and imposed their religion (Islam) and language (Arabic). They have viewed themselves as superior, as the conveyors of a higher civilization and tended to be patronizing towards those considered as inferior’.  

Slave markets in Libya are existing since Egyptian Pharaohs, and Caliphs of the Ottoman Empire. Even with Gaddafi, the human traffic continued, it was only done in backroom's shadow.",Monaco,/r/europe/comments/7kwdk8/macron_slams_assad_for_comments_on_france/drih0qu/,CitronBleu,1513758031

5996,"&gt; Back when immigration was very low.

Nope, it was still the case until like 2015. Immigration hasn't been ""very low"" in Europe for a long, long time now. It's been consistently high. 

&gt; The vast majority of 'refugees' are actually immigrants, and noone believes that they will leave after 6 years.
&gt; 

Their personal motivation for coming is irrelevant. They can either apply for asylum, or they can apply to the immigration process. The vast majority of people coming via Mediterranean routes do not qualify for immigration status, so they will end up with a temporary asylum status (or nothing).

&gt; Why do you think it's irrational to want to limit immigration when the rate becomes too high?

Most people aren't experts on immigration and can't determine what's ""too high"" or what the economic impact is. Most credible institutions state the immigration is not extraordinarily high, and that it is an economic net benefit. It is irrational to *choose* to believe otherwise just because you *feel* the immigration is too high.",ALDE,/r/europe/comments/7krmuw/un_rights_chief_slams_peddling_of_fear_in/drih2xm/,jtalin,1513758176
