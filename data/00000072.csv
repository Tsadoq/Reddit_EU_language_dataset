The strategy is called ""flattening the curve"", which means using mitigation techniques (such as social distancing and improved hand hygiene) to slow the spread of the virus so that the healthcare system isn't overwhelmed, while also increasing the capacity of the healthcare system (""raising the line"").

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattening\_the\_curve#/media/File:20200403\_Flatten\_the\_curve\_animated\_GIF.gif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattening_the_curve#/media/File:20200403_Flatten_the_curve_animated_GIF.gif)

Before Covid-19, this was the usual and normal response to an epidemic/pandemic when no vaccine is available. It doesn't mean the goal is ""herd immunity"", but it does mean the virus will slowly burn through the population until either a vaccine is available or enough people have developed immunity through exposure.

If the goal were herd immunity, we did a terrible job, since we never even needed to use the field hospitals which were set up in the beginning of the pandemic, due to the mitigation measures that were put in place (and are still in effect).",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/ij75oj/top_15_european_countries_by_total_deaths_per/g3ca8hm/,AdvancedFollower,1598784715

I'm sorry but it's not worth it. The people who make these decisions are generally old and have already done their travelling, gotten a job and started a family. It's not fair that we never let young people travel or live a normal life because some people are scared of the flu.

505,"&gt; The easiest way to explain this is with marriage. Imagine if you were married and her ex still loves her so he feels negatively affected by your marriage. Your marriage is fully legal, and a higher authority has ratified it. 

Yes, but there is no ""higher authority"", at least not one where the consent of the subordinate is not required. The closest we have to that are entities where their might makes right. The marriage is legal according to that ""higher authority"". The bummer is that if the ex does not recognize that ""higher authority"", it does not matter. Especially because that higher authority which ratified it has not legal authority over the ex.



&gt; What you can do if you are the ex legally? Pretty much nothing. You can try targeting the authority that issued the marriage, or the people that got married, but at the end of the day a contract that does not include you can never be understood to be for your benefit or determent. This is the case for "" Res inter alios acta, aliis nec nocet nec prodest "" 

Well, since there is no ""higher authority"" per se, the ex could do whatever they want. For example, they could simply act like the marriage is not valid. The only option which I (since you used ""you"") and my partner could do is find powerful friends whose might makes right. That is also roughly what generally happens around the world.

&gt; Going back to our issue, the whole international community applies a common standard that cannot be understood as being against Turkey or harming Turkey, because that's neither its goal nor intention. Greece will extend its territorial waters, not on what is Turkish waters but what is international waters, therefore Turkey cannot have a say on this issue. 

Nice, but there is no legal obligation though.

Every entity can do whatever it wants. Whether it will de facto be the case is another story. Turkey may not have a say, but they will simply ignore it as if Greece never did it. And since Turkey is not part of the UNCLOS there is no legal obligation for Turkey to follow Greece's claim nor are there any legal motions which could affect Turkey.

What could happen is that Greece's powerful friends may help them out and punish Turkey. But then again why talk about ""international law"" if the argument devolves into ""might makes right"" or how people on here seem to say ""yeah, but Turkey will be isolated on that issue as Greece is backed by powerful friends""?

513,"&gt; The British Library’s chief librarian has claimed “racism is a creation of white people” and backed calls for major cultural change at the institution, the Telegraph can reveal.

&gt; Liz Jolly manes the vast collection of literary treasures held by the institution, and is supporting changes to displays and collections in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests. Reforms are being proposed by a “Decolonising Working Group”, which claims the British Library’s London building is an imperialism symbol because it resembles a battleship.

&gt; Staff being supported to decolonise the UK’s national library have also suggested that traditional puppet Mr Punch reflects “colonial violence” The Telegraph has exclusively obtained documents revealing these claims, and a letter endorsed hundreds of employees which declared a racial “state of emergency” at the institution.

&gt; In response to this emergency, an internal report called for the removal of statues of the library’s founding fathers, replacing “Eurocentric” maps, and reviewing collections of western classical music which staff branded part of the “outdated notion” of Western Civilization.

&gt; The institution recently faced calls for defunding from MPs after the Telegraph revealed employees had urged colleagues to donate to Black Lives Matter and back the work of Labour MP Dianne Abbott.

&gt; The Telegraph can now reveal that Chief Librarian Ms Jolly has urged white staff to support the institution's plans to purge the library of perceived racism. In a video clip obtained by the Telegraph she tells colleagues: “I think, as I have said before, that we need to make sure some white colleagues are involved, because racism is a creation of white people.”

&gt; Ms Jolly receives between £120,000 and £125,000 per year for her work as Chief Librarian, a role she has held since 2018. She has given her support to a broad “Anti-Racism Project” proposed in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, telling colleagues “particularly pressing” work was ongoing to review “artworks in the St Pancras building”.

&gt; Ms Jolly assured staff that the project is “about developing and delivering major cultural change”, and part of this would be ensuring the repository of literary treasures will “reflect the diversity of Britain today”.

&gt; There are calls for the bust of the founder Sir Hans Sloane to be removed due to his connections with the slave trade This followed on from a letter declaring a “state of emergency” at the library, signed by 200 employees, demanding BAME staff should review any job cuts which might affect employees with “protected characteristics” to ensure continued diversity at the library, better treatment of these workers, and ensuring the BAME Network has a say in who is employed as Head of Collections.

&gt; To tackle the legacy of “colonial violence” at the library, the letter also demands a statue of founder Sir Hans Sloane be removed. This recommended removal is echoed in a report by the Decolonising Working Group, which claims that the “physical space” of the British Library contains “manifestations of the institution’s racism” by glorifying the British Empire.

&gt; Staff claim in the report that: “This glorification is hard to miss in the structure of the building itself, designed as it is in the form of a battleship, by far the greatest symbol of British imperialism.”

&gt; The building was designed by architect and former naval officer Sir Colin Wilson, who added maritime references such as portholes to the building.

&gt; In the report aimed at reforming the British Library “as a space”, visual aspects including a portrait of Mr Punch which hangs in the institution is critiqued.

&gt; The character, popular at seaside shows is: “A theatrical figure from the heyday of Victorian imperialism who ‘entertained’ through an abuse of women and children that mirrored colonial Violence.” Staff have also claimed Library links to the “ongoing settler-colonisation of Palestine”, and have proclaimed that “every vacant wall” of the institution’s property should be used to advertise the cause of anti-racism.

&gt; Other recommended actions include reducing the number of European maps on display, being “tools of power”, and reviewing the presence of busts of Beethoven and Mendelssohn, whose revered status is part and parcel of “western civilizational supremacy”. The music collections should also be diversified, the report suggests.

&gt; The Decolonising Working Group is part of the BAME Network at the library, which advised colleagues to read Marxist authors and support Black Lives Matter, deeming “colour-blindness” a form of “covert white supremacy”. 

&gt; In their compiled report circulated among staff they demand the bust of another library founder, botanist Sir Joseph Banks, be removed and the statue of King George III be reviewed.

&gt; Their work has been acknowledged by the ongoing Anti-Racism Project at the institution, which is being backed Chief Executive Roly Keating and Chief Librarian Ms Jolly, who has enjoined white staff to advance the project to address the “creation by white people” “This says to me that there is something fundamentally wrong with the leadership of the British Library,” said MP Ben Bradley.

&gt; “If the Chief Librarian is so unhappy with British history perhaps they should not be in that job.

&gt; “The very suggestion that racism only applies in one direction , by white people towards BAME people, is categorically false, inflammatory and divisive.”

&gt; The British Library houses almost 200 million objects, many of which have major importance to British history, culture, and literature. These include two copies of the Magna Carta.

&gt; The institution and Ms Jolly have been contacted for comment.

Ironically this practice actually supports Turkey.

**Res inter alios acta, aliis nec nocet nec prodest (Latin for ""a thing done between others does not harm or benefit others"") is a law doctrine which holds that a contract cannot adversely affect the rights of one who is not a party to the contract.**

Turkey is not party to the UNCLOS but it is adversely affected by it.

So you basically support ""Res inter alios acta"" when it is convenient, but not when it is not convenient.

660,"&gt; The sanctions are definitely achieving something.

I agree. They achieve the opposite of what most people think they might achieve.

&gt; Even if the pipeline gets built, it still sends a geopolitical signal to Eastern European countries that their interests are aligned with the US.

But everybody in here already knows that Eastern Europe is nothing but an American subcontractor, so the US doesn't really gain anything that it didn't have already by alienating the EU's biggest economy. 

&gt; All supporting the pipeline does is isolate Germany.

The sanctions changed exactly that. Brussels, for instance, was never in favour of the pipeline. But it's even less in favour of seeing Washington apply extraterritorial sanctions on an EU member, so it's now firmly in camp Nord Stream.

Law of the Sea Convention recognizes that if an entire country is an archipelago, it has the right to establish its maritime jurisdiction on the basis of its islands. Greece is not entirely archipelago, but this map is based on the assumption that it is.
This is the base argument. 

""One of the new terms of the Convention that does not apply to the Mediterranean is that of “archipelagic states.” The UNCLOS of1982 established that the term “archipelago” refers to a group of islands and interconnecting waters that are closely interrelated and form an intrinsic geographical, political, and economic entity. In the Mediterranean, only the Maltese islands would qualify under the above definition and even in that case its archipelagic waters will be quite small.""

"" *In 1999 Greece’s National Intelligence Agency (EYP) conducted a high-risk operation that ended in a debacle and strained its relations with the United  States, Turkey, and other nations. The operation was an effort to transfer Abdullah Ocalan, the fugitive founding leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), from Greece to a country in Africa to avoid his capture by Turkish authorities. Athens’s plan was to hide Ocalan in the Greek embassy in Nairobi until he could be transferred to another location. Army Major Savvas Kalenteridis, an EYP officer, was assigned to escort Ocalan to his destination. Instead, his actions in Nairobi not only failed to keep Ocalan from his pursuers but led to an international flap and ended several careers, eventually including his own. In the process, the Greeks exposed the ineffectiveness of their intelligence apparatus, which violated numerous fundamentals of intelligence tradecraft.* ""

also when Ocalan captured with Cyprus ID he said how PKK trained by Greek Army : "" During his trial, Öcalan admitted, as quoted in Hürriyet  that ""Greece has for years supported the PKK movement. They even gave  us arms and rockets. Greek officers gave guerrilla training and  explosives training to our militants"" at a camp in Lavrion, Greece. ""

The other option is lowering the imports of oil and gas, but as I said, running for oil is quite primitive when world's goal this century is to turn green. A war definitely won't be in Turkey's interest since it's standing against another NATO member therefore it can't pull the shit US had.

Turkey won't be part of EU in the near future because it has a really big population relative to the rest and therefore it'll have way too much power in the European Parliament.

Getting a degree is merely a stamp saying, 'I'm better than them, hire me'. In some fields this is very relevant, like in Law, Medicine and Science. But on the whole, the stuff you learnt at Uni, could have been spent applying yourself to an actual profession which requires specialised knowledge.

945,"&gt;3 - Not being a party to the Treaty means that as far as Turkey (and other non-parties) is concerned, they are not violating anyone elses rights

This is really problematic. One of the biggest issues of Turkey's foreign policy is that it's the only country in the world that doesn't follow this. And it insists for years that it has say in bilateral relations that it's not a part of.

Most importantly the treaty that Greece and Italy signed to hand over the Dodecanese. The treaty is very badly written, doesn't enumerate all islands, and demanded that the islands be demilitarized, however both Greece and Italy (the signatories) are 100% in line with Greece establishing a National Guard on the islands, and about which islands were transferred (all of them). However, Turkey (a non signatory) would disagree, even though Turkey had nothing to do with this.

The same takes place today. Turkey wants to have solid declarations of EEZ and Continental shelf, but doesn't like the legal views of all other countries in the world. So the Turks feel confident having opinions over things that doesn't concern them legally and they are trying to force their own interpretation of what those things are.

In effect, Turkey will try to find any excuse to get its way, even when it's 100% legally clear that it should not get a say. So lets stop pretending that the Turkish government follows legal philosophy whatsoever. They are just opportunists and dangerous.

Greece couldn't care less about what was going there and only did after that deal (now supporting Hafter is not something I agree with personally but it was also kinda forced.

Its not simply because the ambassador's father was a Nazi, it's because his father was very close with Hitler. His father recieved a slap on the wrists off the Western Allies after the war, and because of this the ambassador lived a privileged life off the back of the Holocaust (indirectly).

But again, there are all kinds of discrimination going on, some others hate hungarians (our biggest minority) for some reason, some others russians and so on, and lastly some others do hate other romanians as well, quite very much. So it's not based on skin and neither for being roma, it's all sorts of things going on. Since the fall of communism people have seen more of the roma people around cities. Those that didn't want to integrate into society during the communism isolated themselves outside of cities, or forced by the communism more to say, but that's another story. I guess the fact that suddenly, after the fall of communism, most of the petty thieves or beggars and so on were of roma ethnicity is what made some people jump into this hating a whole ethnicity thing. It's a lot to talk about, their history, our history, history together, and why things are the way they are.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/iifo0v/confusing_fuckery/g38i9ow/,gigibutelie,1598705214

1247,"The change from using ""Reich"" (empire) to ""Bund"" as a prefix was largely motivated to distinguish the new institutions from the Nazi institutions after the second world war and the subsequent restructuring of German politics under the influence of the United States, Great Britain and France. But since the building ""Reichstag"" burned down during the time the Nazis took power, they never used it as a building and it got to keep its name. The Reichstag as a political institution however became a pseudo-parliament after 1933 (20 sessions in 12 years, 100% of the seats held by Hitlers NSDAP), so the new german parliament got a new name: Bundestag.

Bund can be translated fo federation, so it is used correctly. Bundestag - Federal parliament. Bundeskanzler - Federal chancelor. Bundesadler - eagle of the federation.

Whereas Reich can be translated with empire, and used in the same way. It all coincides with the overall renaming from German Empire to Federal Republic of Germany.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/iib2ji/otto_wels_was_the_only_member_of_parliament_to/g38a6uj/,SeeSebbb,1598697969

An analogy: you are a person who is selling illegal weapons to terrorists (for example)? Your country is close to finding out what you are doing, because although you file a zero income tax report, you live in a seaside resort and drive 50 Ferrari’s? Well, if you give us money, we will grant you a visa and get away from that place! Don’t worry citizens, if the accusations are true, we will prosecute him here. Let’s get his money first and we will figure it out afterwards! I’m sure it’s all slander!

1442,"Well, so much incorrect info here. Lots of Greek and EU solidarity supporters are online in this sub. Unfortunately msot of them have no idea, or blinded by the mainstream populist media. I will clarify here the judiciary facts. 

The international law determining the order in the seas today is the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.  This contract was the result of a series of conferences between 1974-82.  It has been approved by 167 states.  Turkey is a  non-state party to the Convention.  The maximum width of the article concerning the territorial waters is 12 miles. Some parts of the Convention, regarding small islands and economic zones as well as continental shelf , were found not suitable by Turkey.  However, many articles of the Convention have become common law rules.  Therefore, it also applies to states that are not parties to the Convention.

Regarding the limits of maritime jurisdiction : If the continental shelves or economic zones of the states with mutual coasts overlap,, a limitation problem arises.  As the ICJ stated in the case concerning delimitation of the maritime boundary in the gulf of Maine area, in such cases no state can unilaterally define the boundaries of its maritime jurisdictions (no countries--this includes Turkey. Libya, Greece etc:). The borders should be determined by agreement between the riparian states.

 In the Convention, the articles regarding the limitation of the continental shelf and economic zones, it is stipulated that the delimitation will be made by agreement between the parties, comply with international law and reach an equitable solution, for example a midline or a special solution. 

For a similar case, if you would like to understand the main agreement which helped enormously to form the pillars of the international court of justice for such matters, look for  the 20.02.1969 North Sea continental shelf case, between Germany and Holland.",,/r/europe/comments/iilfny/are_there_any_nonturkish_european_redditors_who/g37wp3p/,hektorhektor1,1598684063

I want to be as polite as possible, but this is some of the most fucked-up apologetics I have ever read.  

[The Soviet invasion of Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Poland) wasn't some valiant attempt to push back the Nazis. It was an operation to destroy an independant country, in [close cooperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%E2%80%93Soviet_military_parade_in_Brest-Litovsk) with the Nazis, followed by attempts to eradicate basically that [entire country's intellectual elite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre). 

[The Soviet invasion of the Baltics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_the_Baltic_states_(1940\)) did absolutely nothing to push back the Nazis, but it did result in ""political repressions followed with mass deportations of around 130,000 citizens carried out by the Soviets"".

The [Soviet occupation of Bessarabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_Bessarabia_and_northern_Bukovina) likewise did *nothing* against Nazism, but resulted in thousands being sentenced to death, and thousands more being massacred.

1647,"Sure, it's very dirty. I'm not saying that it was done in the very best way possible either. But if the USSR didn't partition Poland, not only would have been invaded in its entirety by the Nazis and there would have been a serious chance for the Nazis to win WW2, killing millions to tens of million more people. This simply isn't disputable, it is what would have happened in the USSR did not invade Poland. Reality sucks like this. Now, the USSR under Stalin did some seriously fucked up things in doing so, but it didn't invade Poland just for fun and wanted an alliance with France the UK, which was denied. So the idea that the USSR was cooperating with the Nazis so that it could invade Poland and the Baltics is completely ridiculous as that invasion was necessary, and they tried to pursue alternative solutions.

If you want to know if a thing is justified in the context of international politics, the test is simple. Would doing that things lead to better, or worse outcomes? It is nigh-undeniable that a Soviet invasion of Poland and the Baltics in 1939 leads to much better outcomes than inaction. So it is justified. How that invasion was done by itself might not be, and neither could be the ulterior acts, but it was still justified. Because of this, and the fact that the USSR was aware that this would happen, the partition under the Molotov-Ribbentrop act is an act of self-preservation and not aggression. Especially when you consider the fact that this was their *backup plan*. 

Finally, the claim that the invasion of the Baltics by the USSR did nothing to prevent the Nazis is absurd on its face given the fact that the Nazis literally had to invade the Baltics before being able to mount a competent offensive against the Soviets. It very certainly and materially worked against the Nazis, and leaving the Baltics to be directly invaded by the Nazis would have led to much worse outcomes for everyone.",,/r/europe/comments/iib2ji/otto_wels_was_the_only_member_of_parliament_to/g37ghz6/,IAmTheSysGen,1598671495

Meaning if a network upgrade is to be made it has often to be co-timed with planned/necessary work on the roads itself (because the cables run underneath them or the pavements). And trying to get three or four companies coordinated schedule-wise is a nightmare in itself.

The government is very reluctant to give subsidies since it can't force federal states and municipalities to use them on specific issues.

1697,"The problems are kinda complicated to be disgusted in short replies, at least for me.There are multiple EEZ conflicts between the eastern Mediterranean countries and most notable those of Cypriotic-Turkish EEZ. Turkey doesn't recognize \*any\* EEZ for the island and EU doesn't want to stay apathetic when a member state being bullied (or portrayed on being so) - EU stance also showcases that they can act as a political union (aka defending the interests of their members) and a serious geopolitical player, maybe for the first time in their history.

Other problematic parts are the claims of Turkish EEZ into the Aegean. Turkish proposed EEZ denies from half the Greek islands any economic activity (!) from their surrounded seas, including fishing activities, diving expeditions, underwater pipelines - vital to transfer gas, drinking water, electricity, phone lines, etc, in essence asking for complete soft control over them.

The parts that I disagree with the Greek side is the EEZ below Kastellorizo (a small Greek island south of Turkey) which shuts down any turkish claims in the region according to UNCLOS. ICJ could base this case on customary laws and judge in favor of Turkey (giving the island a smaller EEZ for their economic activities). In my eyes, Turkey has to push Greece into icj and make this particular demand an international affair.

Lastly, from both sides, turks and greeks could deemed as traitors/unpatriotic to a degree, if they don't embrace their country's maximalistic approach to this or other geopolitical issues. I think same goes for almost all the countries of the world, some  others might even enforce punishments to the ones who derail from their state's views.

1749,"&gt; That’s probably one of the most famous sentences in German history?

Small selection of sentences in German history that I think are more famous, off the top of my head:

Hier stehe ich, ich kann nicht anders.

Aus dem Hintergrund müsste Rahn schießen... Rahn schießt! Tor! Tor! Tor! Deutschland ist Weltmeister!

Jetzt wächst zusammen, was zusammen gehört.

Ich bin ein Berliner.

Ihr Völker der Welt - schaut auf diese Stadt!

Seit 5:45 Uhr wird zurückgeschossen!

Wollt ihr den totalen Krieg?!

Freiheit ist immer die Freiheit des Andersdenkenden.

Pardon wird nicht gegeben! Gefangene werden nicht gemacht! Wie vor tausend Jahren die Hunnen unter ihrem König Etzel sich einen Namen gemacht, der sie noch jetzt in Überlieferung und Märchen gewaltig erscheinen läßt, so möge der Name Deutscher in China auf 1000 Jahre durch euch in einer Weise bestätigt werden, daß es niemals wieder ein Chinese wagt, einen Deutschen scheel anzusehen!

Seine Majestät der König hat es darauf abgelehnt, den Französischen Botschafter nochmals zu empfangen, und demselben durch den Adjutanten vom Dienst sagen lassen, dass Seine Majestät dem Botschafter nichts weiter mitzuteilen habe.

Ein Gespenst geht um in Europa - das Gespenst des Kommunismus. (Die Proletarier haben nichts in ihr zu verlieren als ihre Ketten. Sie haben eine Welt zu gewinnen.)

Denk ich an Deutschland in der Nacht, dann bin ich um den Schlaf gebracht.

Jeder soll nach seiner Façon selig werden.

1766,"&gt;Thälmann was an idiot and his adherence to the theory of “social fascism” - ie.: the SPD are our worst enemy and in fact “fascist” - was instrumental in helping Hitler achieve power because it divided the anti-Nazi left. 

&gt;The most we can say about it really is that it was a tragic mistake/miscalculation on the part of some of the communists - note: many of them opposed this strategy all along. It certainly does not betray some sort of secret affinity or alliance. And Thälmann himself was to pay a heavy price for it - you know, being slowly tortured to death in Hitler’s dungeons for the next decade...

Dude you almost had it in the first half, but then you went on and painted the KPD as some kind of misguided good guys who, if they would have not fought the SPD, would have been a viable alternative to the democratic parties.

The thing is, they were not.

The KPD were literal Stalinists who supported the purges of the Soviet Union which cost the lifes of millions. A Communist Germany would have transformed into a brutal dictatorship with similar purges. The German Communists would have allied with Stalin just like Hitler did and together they would divide Eastern Europe likewise. The Communists explicitly vowed to reverse the Versailles treaty, retake Danzig and probably would have attacked Poland in alliance the Soviet Union, which would trigger a chain of events we already know...

1767,"Which means that the EU should look for a third option. They want to talk military, we will talk economy. The Turkish economy is under pressure, so we light a fire under it.

Main Turkish export to the EU are textiles and transport equipment, so we need to hit those sectors indirectly. Especially textiles.

There are 3 avenues:

* Prop up local production in the EU (Greece would be great).

* Encourage new source of goods (India makes a lot of textiles)

* Change up regulation to interfere with Turkish production (lower to replace Turkey with cheaper alts, raise to potentially block Turkey like US chlorinated chicken).

The problem is that these hit mostly indiscriminately unless you're being careful and they are slow, but it could be a very effective stick economically against Turkey.

I believe the reason for the negativity is mainly cause trump = Hitler in the minds of European MSM and it shows. So anything regarding ""America's not bad"" is reduced to ""but trump, therefore superbad"".

For the longest time no one in their right mind thought the Nazis were a serious threat; the SPD referred to the KPD as “fascist”, too, and was instrumental in kneecapping their ability to confront the Nazis on the streets by banning their paramilitary organizations as well as breaking strikes, etc.

The most we can say about it really is that it was a tragic mistake/miscalculation on the part of some of the communists - note: many of them opposed this strategy all along.

Whataboutism. Higher prices on Big Macs? Like a food tax? Or a fat tax? Yeah, I don't think people would like that either. And there really isn't any measure I can think of that would reduce more CO2 with less effort. It's literally just some signs.

Sure it's not gonna solve climate change, but no single measure will. There is nothing that cannot be made to look insignificant in relation to something bigger. If Germany went back to medieval times and produced no CO2 whatsoever, worldwide emissions would be reduced by only 3%. So it doesn't matter what we do. Yet the average German emits more than twice as much as the average human. So what we do actually matters twice as much as what others do. If we cannot make a credible effort, how can we expect others to do so?

&gt;It's a weird issue to try to force against a sizable opposition

What's weird about it? Literally every other country in the world has a universal speed limit.

1887,"There was this concept called ""social fascism"" which the KPD used to describe the SPD, who they considered their main ""rival"" in the left, because they saw them as taking votes and support from workers and other people. According to them and Stalin, social democracy was a ""traitor"" ideology to communism, because they split form Marxism and stopped being revolutionaries, thinking they could uplift the working classes with democracy and, well, social democracy and welfare. So, the KPD said this was just a ruse, because it would not *truly* uplift the workers because it would not remove capitalism, because no revolution and that stuff. And that was just fascism-with-another-name according to the KPD.

So, it came up with the KP saying they were fighting fascism, including ""social fascism"", which was the SPD.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_fascism

&gt;In 1929, the KPD's paramilitary organisation, the Roter Frontkämpferbund (""Alliance of Red Front-Fighters""), was banned as extremist by the governing social democrats.[6] A KPD resolution described the ""social fascists"" [social democrats] as the ""main pillar of the dictatorship of Capital"".[7] In 1931, the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) referred to the Nazis as ""working people's comrades"". In Prussia, the largest state of Germany, the KPD united with the Nazis in unsuccessful attempt to bring down the state government of SPD by means of a Landtag referendum. In 1931, the KPD, under the leadership of Ernst Thälmann, internally used the slogan ""After Hitler, our turn!"" since it strongly believed that a united front against Nazis was not needed and that the workers would change their opinion and recognize that Nazism, unlike communism, did not offer a true way out of Germany's difficulties.",Poland if it was colonized by Somalia,/r/europe/comments/iib2ji/otto_wels_was_the_only_member_of_parliament_to/g36oxdu/,CMuenzen,1598655186

Catalonia has a history that is distinct from the rest of Spain, they have a cultural identity separate from being Spanish, much like how Scotland has within the UK. Spain itself like the UK was formed by a union of two separate states, one being the Kingdom of Aragon which is roughly synonymous with Catalonia. 

I think Spain would be right to give Catalonia and the Basque Region a means to determine their futures independently of Spain on those grounds in the same way I think it's right for us in the UK to give those options to the Irish and Scottish if they desire them. 

That isn't to say I don't agree with the principle of territorial integrity that you mention further down, if say, Essex decided they want independence from the UK, they can get to fuck. But in cases where you have a culture, whether it be Irish, Scottish or Catalonian that is unified with a much larger cultural group such as the English or Castilian Spanish, then to respect their minority position and not have it be a one sided relationship those smaller groups should be given a means to forge their own path.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/ihidg7/visa_requirements_for_kosovar_citizens/g369jtb/,Mynameisaw,1598647345

Right now I'm in the country to participate in the protests, but in general I moved out several years ago mostly because didn't want to live under dictatorship anymore. So while technically I don't exactly ""live in Belarus"", I think I'm qualified enough to answer the question:)

So, the amount of people who use Belarusian as their main language on daily basis has to be under 10%, likely about 5% or something like that. For example, from all of my friends only one guy speaks Belarusian all the time. If I add all my acquaintances, there will be a couple of people more. Still, the majority of population consider Belarusian to be their native language, even if they don't use it actively.

That said, you see and hear Belarusian on daily basis. In public transport stations are anounced in Belarusian (exclusively, I think), a lot of social and commercial ads are in Belarusian, etc. Belarusan is also much more common among artists, musicians, actors, novelists than among general population. But these days, on the wave of protests, it feels like Belarusian is finally gaining more popularity among ordinary people too. I hope the trend continues:)

As for the rural area/cities, yes, Belarusian is more widespread in the rural parts of the country; also, more in the western part than in the east.

Edit. And about schools. I'm not aware of the current situation, but back in my days, we had several classes of Belarusian language and several classes of Belarusian literature per week.

1975,"Sorry if I came across as condescending, I did not mean to. My intention was to find out where you are coming from, argument-wise. It sounded a bit like you were questioning that high speed equals lower efficiency and that would mean questioning physics itself.

The specific graph I provided may well be questioned, though - I could not tell you where the data comes from and how it was reached. But the general shape of that graph will be the same for every car.

I would not support a 50km/h speed limit. Despite the urgency of climate change, other factors still matter. There has to be a balance between human comfort and the environment. It would also be highly beneficial for our CO2 footprint if we never heated our homes in winter. After all, we could simply wear several wool pullovers and coats. And if we stopped using washing machines and went back to scrubbing our clothes over tubs. All that doesn't strike me as sensible.

In fact, I don't support a speed limit on our Autobahnen. I very much enjoy the status quo. But I'll be the first to admit that's as highly irrational position and if I spent more time studying graphs and learning about the expected CO2 savings of a 130km/h limit I might change my mind, biting my lip and cursing myself in the process.

But if I had to find a sensible limit that strikes a balance between energy efficiency and human comfort, I'd probably arrive at a number between 90 and 130km/h. The lower number would be optimal in regard to throughput (bandwidth). The higher number seems sufficient that nobody could seriously claim that their movement over open roads is significantly impeded.

When trying to reduce our carbon footprint we (and by that I mean smarter people than I) have to look where we can get the most bang for the buck. Rather than reduce speed to a crawl (like 50km/h) we should probably ramp up green energy production much faster than we do now. With green electricity we could then power electric or fuel cell cars. When it comes to dealing with global inequality I have no doubt, though, that we would have to reduce our standard of living. It's pretty clear that our lifestyle is only feasible through exploitation of ""the other half"".",,/r/europe/comments/ii301r/maximum_speed_limits_on_european_motorways_and/g36ag9o/,Engelberto,1598647785

He resigned after a long string of controversies.

He was widely disliked before that already and had pretty much zero appeal to anyone who wasn't already voting for SAP, so he wouldn't have lasted long as party leader either way.


Regarding Löfven, he's pretty much what you would have guessed given his background as a union negotiator: maybe not the best at convincing voters, but clearly very good at reaching compromises that favor his party.

The Ministry of Education - likewise, for at least the last couple of ministers (Piontkowski - the current one - has worked as a teacher, apparently), I guess?

But hey, speed is definitely a major factor in deaths on the road. 
Roads are a lot safer now that maniacs can't go as fast as they want, because they will ALWAYS end up in the wall or in someone's car.
Roads are a lot safer here too since the introduction of a car checkup every two years. 
Everything counts when it comes to road safety.

If I have to slam on the brakes, I WILL. And cars nowadays stops a lot faster then they accelerate. Brakes are very powerful nowadays.
This is a big danger as well. That's why I'm driving slow : I'll drive to the limitations as much as I can, but if someone tailgates me I'm like ""OK so what if I slam on the brakes? No way this dude can stop as fast as me"" so I reduce my speed at least 20 kph which is making them angry but at least I'm reducing the potential damage.

Normal a highway can be 100 or 120 or 130 (even the same highway can differ from just what part you are)

touringcars/busses 100

cars with trailer 90

trucks 80

BUT, between 0600 and 1900 hours the max is 100 everywhere for cars.

Then this all can be overruled by matrixsigns when the auto trafficjam computer detects something or a traffic inspector sees something like a broken car and the signs can be from 50-70-90 as max. and this can be anytime during the day.

This is, the left and right lane can be on different speeds or even a lane can be closed.

edit: oh yea we have the -spitsstrook- normally the sidelane empty for emergency vehicles or broken cars but when the 2 lane 100 km/h is too busy they open the emergency lane for traffic and behold somehow automagicly it goes with one extra lane from 100 to 80.",,/r/europe/comments/ii301r/maximum_speed_limits_on_european_motorways_and/g35ferc/,TheArtistFormerlyVes,1598633157

Turkey and Turkish nationalists bark too much and harrass their neighbors and non-neighbor Europeans, threatening with violence and migration and the West don't bark but eventually the West will have enough of it one day and bite Turkey so hard as to remind Turkey what happened when Turkey or Ottoman Empire fought a war against major powers the last time around.

Why? Serious question. Having a separate grade for behavior makes sense, but why should it affect your other grades? It's inevitably going to lead to a lot of biased grading that can't be appealed because no other teacher was in that classroom and can give a second opinion.

&gt; Their work is not sound if they're missing around instead of working. 

The test score is the work. The purpose of math class is to teach mathematics, not to teach you to sit still and quietly pretend to do math. That's not a useful skill.

&gt;Richard Dixon, the director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: “In terms of energy security, clearly there’s no problem. Its reactors haven’t been running and the lights haven’t gone out. What’s more urgent now is to build up renewables and energy efficiency, to make sure the gap left by Hunterston is filled by zero-carbon electricity or energy saving.”

This is also my opinion. As with many states globally, the introduction of a firmer carbon tax would of course increase the speed at which this could happen. In the UK, there is already a national scheme in addition to the ETS emission trading system the EU organises.

False, as proven in my previous post. They have increased since the fall of communism across all states.

Some of them fear a limitation of civil rights which we already have endured for year now (e.g. surveilance laws), who could blame that. 

In addition many people in germany live under worsening living conditions and corona is the last drop filling the barrel, bringing them to the brink. Many fear now that they get added to the poor half of the population, for which no one at the top government level cares about in germany. We are richt, we could care, but we dont.

2445,"Net migration to the UK has risen to the highest level since the EU referendum in June 2016. The total number of people coming to the country is also at a record high.

The increase, to about 313,000, was driven largely by students from outside the EU coming to universities and colleges, plus others arriving to work.

The enforced removals of failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants were at their lowest on record.

A record 715,000 people who said they planned to stay in the UK for more than a year arrived in the year to March and about 405,000 left, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Net migration — the difference between those arriving and those leaving for more than a year — rose by 92,000 to an estimated 313,000 in the year to March, to reach the highest level since 2016, when it stood at 326,000.

Jay Lindop, director of the centre for international migration at the Office for National Statistics, said: “We are seeing migration levels begin to rise driven by increases in non-EU student arrivals, mainly from China and India.”

Net migration from the EU fell from 62,000 to 58,000, whereas from outside the EU it jumped from 213,000 to 316,000, the highest level since records began 45 years ago.

Of those coming to the UK, 257,000 came to study and about 460,000 to work, to accompany or join their family or for other reasons. About 75,000 arrived from the EU to work plus a further 101,000 from the rest of the world either seeking work or with a job offer.

Kevin Foster, the immigration minister, said: “These figures demonstrate we attract the brightest and best from across the globe, who come to the UK to work and study. There are more international students at our universities, alongside overseas doctors and nurses playing a key role [in] our NHS. We are introducing our new points-based system, which will attract the people we need to drive our economy and lay the foundation for a high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity economy.”

The latest net migration figure is three times higher than the 100,000 target set by David Cameron before the Conservatives abandoned it in 2018.

Alp Mehmet, the chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: “The figures are shocking. The record level of net non-EU migration is an indication of the scale of the problem and what the government needs to control and reduce. The points-based immigration system will do nothing of the sort; if anything, the inflow of migrants will increase.”

The set of figures is likely to be the last showing a big number arriving and leaving, because the Covid-19 pandemic has caused visa applications to fall. Between April and last month there was a 99 per cent fall in study visas issued, a 96 per cent drop in Tier 2 skilled work visas and 90 per cent fall in family visas compared with the same period last year.

Separate Home Office figures showed a big jump in visas issued to people coming to study in the UK, with the number rising by 23 per cent to 299,000 in the year to March — the highest in nine years. About 40 per cent were granted to Chinese people, with Indian citizens accounting for 49,000, or 17 per cent. Later figures taking in the three months from March to June show a substantial drop in visas issued to the same groups.",Pro-European (In both senses),/r/europe/comments/ii4vgb/net_immigration_to_uk_at_highest_level_in_four/g34eidl/,delarussieavecamour,1598611711

2646,"For Lukashenko idk if its true or not, but for us there is a lot at stake here. Anyone telling you otherwise is willingly ignorant about it which only serves other side. Believe me, opposition pulled out all the stops this time. Since they get their money from Belgrade, weve been under so much propaganda especially the last few days of the election. Fake facebook profiles(lots and lots of bots on all our media sites), fake news articles, financing pro Russian/Serbian media in the country and working overtime, we see non stop videos about this situation being made from Serbia, its in their interests to protect their churches so now they play non stop propaganda pieces made by god know who, praising the war mongering priests which deny many things like genocide in Srebrenica, and create this almost war like atmosphere. In the last couple of days, we have had an official Chetnik gathering in one of our towns called Berane, grafitti have been raised talking about driving muslim population out of the city, etc. We have had people on our streets singing about Kosovo and Serbia and other things. Giant gatherings where they display chruch insignia and curse everyone who doesnt support them. So yeah, he is an autocrat but if the opposition wasnt so BAD he would have been gone long ago. If they stopped talking about Kosovo and Serbia and all that stuff, people would have voted him out ages ago. But no, one of opposition leaders in our parlament suggested and called to arm all of his friends from the 90s if need be (he is called a chetnik duke for a reason). So yeah. Milo is bad. Milo is terrible. But i will pick him any day over people waving crosses and singing about Kosovo, calling to arms and having more than QUESTIONABLE relationship with every other minority in this country. Believe me, no one and i mean NO ONE from minority groups votes for them. No albanians, croats or bosniaks ever, and thats for a good reason. It is a lot of fear mongering, but opossition and their priests give them more than enough material to work with. It takes 2 to tango, and believe me, they both play their roles beautifully. One is playing the role of savior of our independence for like 10th time since our independence vote, and the opposition is playing the role of a scare crow, the ones that will take that away and a lot else providing them with more than enough materials to scare others with, if they didnt maybe one of the minority votes would be theirs AFTER 25 YEARS, and they would have won the election. Milo is an autocrat but he can never hope to siphon enough votes for victory without actual major support of his voter base, and he wouldnt have his voters if chruches and opposition woulndnt be SO BAD and representing ANYONE but themselves and their supporter group, nothing bad in that, its just that you cant win an election pandering only to 1 group. I always say, only chetniks will vote for chetniks. No one will vote for the PRO SERB - PRO SERB UNION block except Serbs here. And there are a lot of them, just not enough to ever win the election. But their whole politic revolves around Serbs only and then when they lose, they wonder why they lost (because no one but Serbs voted for them). I am mainly speaking for the Leading opposition party (DF - democratic front). These are the people that voted NO unanimously 2006. Against referendum, and to this day they are openly against it. They dont recognise our flag or our hymn or anything else. They push propaganda that they give them from Belgrade, and deny Montenegrin national identity, calling us all Serbs and those who arent are traitors and killers of ortodox in our society, they are potraying us something like Jews that killed Jesus, like we are the devil if we dont support their skewed versions of Christianity that they preach, curse and constantly call to arms or war over to.

If we had a normal opposition which doesnt deny our referendum rights, Milo would be long gone. If we had ANYONE supporting our flag in the major opposition party, Milo would be long gone. If ANY of the minority parties voted for opposition, Milo would be LONG GONE. So dont think facts are only black and white, because they arent. No one could keep Milo in power this long if there wasnt a genuine reason to fear what other side would do if they got hold of our country. Yes he is an autocrat and a thief, and i dont like him one bit. But what i dislike even more is the opposition who denies my Montenegrin national identity, and would rather see us as a province of Serbia than an independent Balkan country. So before you make your judgement i advise  you see the whole picture. Yes Milo is bad, but he will have an undying support as long as his main opposition are Chetniks and war mongering priests from the 90s.",,/r/europe/comments/ihuy5s/montenegro_president_independence_at_stake_in/g3414pm/,TheRivenRunsDeep,1598597992

2675,"Indeed they are, and it's a problem we need to tackle. But perceiving degrees that women might be interested in as shit degree is not really helpful. Without wanting to play olympics on who contributes more to society, both STEM and non-STEM subjects can. So one shouldn't be more superior to the other, just different interests, life goals, and gender-based pressure.

I see your point, and I've sat in one philosophy class due to interdisciplinary studies. At times, it's hard not to see it the same way as you. I mean, Germany even has the taxi driver joke - which I wasn't even aware of until studying as my family has always been full of teachers and language experts. Thus, I always knew that arts/humanitarian degrees can get you a job aside of being a taxi driver.

I met a guy at uni who was doing some philosophical architecture. He will be sitting in committees of cities and help decide where future architecture projects best should be placed... or something like that. From my experience, arts / humanitarian subjects never lead to a clear job like medicine or law might do. It asks you to do some thinking yourself, and work (both mentally and physically) toward the direction you want to take after your studies. According to the university of Heidelberg, future careers in Philosophy can be writer, researcher, consumer advocate, lawyer, and mental health worker. All of these seem like valuable jobs.

On that note, I envy the United States a tad bit. Many future lawyers first studied arts/humanitarian subjects. Here, philosophy, social sciences, literature, or politics are incredible valuable studies because lawyers only study law in their masters degree, after having expanded their knowledge on moral/social/political thinkers. That's a whole different way to value these subjects because now they seem necessary for lawyers - and they are! How great is it to know political theories on states? Or understand Kant? These are people who, of sorts, helped develop our understanding of what is right and wrong. It also goes the other way around - I studied German's GG for my arts/humanities degree.",Germany / UK,/r/europe/comments/ihp2mv/in_most_european_regions_more_women_than_men_have/g341q5y/,showmaxter,1598598552

2693,"I was replying to the person that said the US only stays neutral only if it is benefits them, which is thought was a ridiculous statement as that is exactly why anyone stays neutral. As for the Greece-Turkey dispute, it is in fact a bonafied dick measuring contest. States tend to become volatile when their status in the region is uncertain. In this case it is obvious that Turkey wants to be regional power, but Greece is kinda in the way of that ambition. Greece on the other hand like you said, is not willing to give cede such a status to Turkey.

Both the EU and NATO both also have good reasons to want to de-escalate the situation with Turkey. Firstly, Turkey is a NATO member, and there is currently no mechanism in place to exclude any member from Alliance. Any attempts to create such a mechanism would obviously be vetoed by a member who stands at risk to be excluded, in recent times that would be Turkey. Secondly, Turkey and Greece's strategic position in Mediterranean are far too important to give up, especially the Bosphorus strait. Greece and Turkey both also allow excellent staging grounds for operations in the Middle East, North Africa and the Black Sea region. By taking a side, say for example to bully Turkey into submission, would mean that we throw Turkey into the arms of Russia, as the two are already flirting with each other.

No we don't. We encourage women to apply to male-dominate fields which bring money and power. We don't encourage anyone to apply to those male-dominated fields which are linked to low salary, because they are not considered aspirational. For the same reason we don't encourage anyone to apply to female-dominated fields.

France has a positive rate of 3%, even testing less. In order to bring the positive rate down to France's levels, the US should either be following the measures a LOT better or it should be testing about twice as much as now - ideally, both. The US is still testing in the average range, not in the best one. And that's even though they're testing more per capita. The key is that the US is not testing enough FOR THE SITUATION. Meaning, it's not useful to compare who's testing more per capita, it's useful to compare who's testing enough for the epidemic in their country. France is doing better in that regard than the US.

The EU has three main bodies - the Commission, the Parliament and the Council of Ministers with a fourth one, the other EU Council (the heads of state meetings) being an unofficial one. The Commission is strictly supra-national, meaning that the representatives there must act in the interests of the EU as a whole as opposed to the interests of their own countries. The representatives in Parliament, similarly, must act in the interest of the people instead of the interest of the countries (those don't always align). The Council of Ministers is strictly a national institution, meaning the ministers must act in the interest of their own countries.

It's a shame really but EU can't be trusted when it comes to international conflicts. Crimea, Turks attacking Syria, Belarus, now this. And that's just few examples.

That being said, as another Finn I absolutely do understand where you're coming from and definitely agree with the way Greece is dealing with this. Erdogan and Turkey are very arrogant, and honestly seem to care very little about anyone else.  Quite a few times a year Russian military planes also do indeed visit Finnish airspace unannounced and they do obviously get a military response in a matter of minutes with our hornets making sure they leave. Not to mention the U-boats.

I think the sad fact is that it's inevitable that world is moving back from globalisation and more towards right-wing, regional stuff, but what can we do really? Just looking at the news as dictators are getting slowly less and less scared of showing their dicks around is pretty clear.

But:

1/3 third of the actual navtex area is closer to Rhodos, Crete and more to the west than Kastelorizo/Turkey. Rhodos is 50 times larger than the Colombian islands as an example.

Another 1/3 is closer to Cyprus than Turkey.

It's very possible that a court would award those or parts of those to Greece and Cyprus.

Additional oil reserves outside the navtex area are around Cyprus including to the south of it as well East and South East of Crete. 

While Turkey claims those areas are in it's EEZ a look at a map will show that in no way that would be fair.

Also the ICJ will have to set the territorial waters as well as an area can't be in Greece's territorial waters and Turkish EEZ or vice versa. That would be 12nmi and not subject to considerations of fairness.

That should not be an issue for Turkey as the oil is way further out than 12nmi. However Turkey is loath to accept Greek islands in the Aegean having 12nmi territorial waters, to the point of voting for a threat of war to Greece in 1996.

iIn the past thew problems were pretty obvious. Women were not allowed to study in university, but the we changed that. 


But now everyone is allowed to attend university, so why is there a problem? We don't even know what the problem is, or how to fix it. We're not even sure whether there is a problem. Maybe men really are naturally more inclined to work as electricians than social worker, on average.

I do not deny that Western Armenia was lost. Yet that was about 1915, and rest were ethnic cleansing in south due to French invasion and some other cleansing or clashes which were sure tragic but hardly can be defined as a genocide.

I'm also not happy with what Mustafa Kemal did with the Armenian issue meaning rather letting it to stay as it is for not alienating groups or to put things as they happen to be in order to not disturb a new national project. Yet not like he himself committed the crimes in such regard. Personally, what he did was wrong for the future of Turkey as well given those regions are now backwards Kurdish majority regions where most of the qualified Western Armenians are gone. That also seen Turkey falling into Islamism with only tokens of Armenians living in certain parts, and Greek pockets leaving with Cyprus issue.

I know what Hamidian Massacres were. It was nothing that new either meaning just letting some Kurds to slaughter and take over lands - as it was done to Alevi Turkomans for a long duree. That's mass massacre and cleansing but I doubt that we can claim that there was the intent to annihilate whole groups? It's like calling pogroms genocide.

You can be sure they took the thousands of islands of the pacific into account, due to colonies, which is a way more complicated issue.

It shouldn't. But why should Greece not follow a treaty that is fair towards them? 

&gt;You can go all in with the UNCLOS but do not forget that Turkey is not bound by the UNCLOS. You can not force the UNCLOS on Turkey.

3155,"We did not do that agreement when we were negotiating with you. We actually did that agreement precisely because you refused to sit on the table.

With regards to ""International law"", I've had enough fruitless discussions here with ""greek professors fo the intl law"" which seems to be every greek redditor ever. It seems like you are watching something in tv and come repeat it here so I will just copy paste something that is not even worthy of your approaches to the topic.

&gt;Any maritime dispute discussions  start from a median (equidistant) line between two countries. However it  is important that where the median line starts from, to make the  discussion fair and equitable. I believe both sides agree to this  premise but there comes the difference in perspective.  
&gt;  
&gt;As per the infamous Seville Map suggest, **Greek side**  claims that Meis Island should be considered in constructing the  medians line between two countries. Their opinion on this matter is that  Meis Island is part of a broader geographical and historical region  called Dodacanese islands (A group of islands southwest of Turkey).  Therefore they want Dodacanese Islands combined should be taken into  account as a mainland while determining EEZ median line.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Turkish claim**  is obvious. Meis Island is considered to be too small and too remote to  be taken into account of construction of the median line, even if it  may be part of a broader region. Historical roles of islands would play  role in a negotiation but not in courts. The courts have seen this  argument being used in Colombia-Nicaragua case. In that, Colombia wanted  their islands to be considered as groups as a mainland, however the  ultimate decision was that the islands were seperated in distance to be  considered so. UK-France case were that the British Islands were too  close to the French mainland so the courts decided that they shouldn't  have a mainland status to include them in determining the median line  because they wouldn't reach a equitable solution. Therefore even if  Dodacanese Islands argument might be important, by being seperated and  being on the wrong side (too close to Turkish coast) Meis Island should  be ignored for construction of median line and only later should be  given an enclaced EEZ.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Greek**  answer to all this is that the International Courts don't have an  obligation to follow the precedent cases as a rule. Automatic  application of precedent decisions as a rule is wrong and each case is  unique. Therefore the starting point for counstrion of EEZ should be  Meis.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Turkish**  reply is that is that if there is a consistent pattern on the case law,  this becomes effectively a binding authority meaning that precedent  case decisions can't be ignored. Barbados- Trinidad Tobago case have  references to earlier court decisions, therefore no reason to ignore  precedent cases. While it is true that each case is unique, there are  plenty of instances where one or more islands are ignored while  determining the median line. One important example is the Guinea -  Guinea Bissaeu case in which Bijagos Islands are as big as Dodacanese  Islands and they weren't considered in equidistance line.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Greek**  answer is that precedent cases can't be in the procedure but they can  be used as a reference, the objection is to apply the precedent cases as  a rule.

Edit: BTW notice how turkish claims are very well exampled. Yeah, thats another thing that bothers me that I frequently hear from greek redditors, they say that what turkey is doing has no examples, while all the examples support the turkish claims.

Well according to the current Turkish goverment it's not so defenite they also published maps claiming lots of islands but that is an other story (although at the same time intertwined because Turkey proves that if you ""settle"" with her she starts to ask for further ""setlements"" to be done ) but I am glad you aknowledge that the islands are indeed Greek.                        
Hence and by definition (third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (1982)) an Exclusive Economical Zone (EEZ)  is when a coastal state e.g an Island assumes jurisdiction over the exploration and exploitation of marine resources in its adjacent section of the continental shelf, taken to be a band extending 200 miles from the shore.

But the army could defend successfully the zone of Smyrna. He later quit his position as general when the government decided to go full attack. 
Also British field Marshall George Milne who was appointed in Smyrna to monitor the Greek army has written reports that claim the capability of the Greek army to successfully defend the area and generally the good odds of a defensive war in the zone of Smyrna. 
Don't forget that at this point the majority of the Turkish army were irregulars transformed later by Kemal as regulars.
Finally, if Greece was on the defensive it would still have the support of the Great Powers.

To simplify the math, and make the explanation more understanble (I hope) I'll use 50% instead of 44%.    
Let's assume British are 50% less productive than the migrants. This means that every time the migrant harvest 100 fruits, the british harvest 50 (50% less of 100 is 50).    
So every time the british harvest 50 fruits, the migrants harvest 100. (which is twice as much, which means that migrant are twice as productive (which is 100% more productive).     
     
If we go back to the original values, we have 100 for migrants and 56 for british.

The pro-russian side has had their power base eroded for years, yet still can muster a pretty strong following, while their oposition formed numerous coalitions, toppling each other in scandal after scandal, including numerous corruption ones. While, obviously, being anti-russian does not mean being pro-union.

Moldova (Besserabia) also missed much of the nation-building of the 19-th century, including the growing pains that romanian moldova had to go through, including anti-unionist riots.

The best time for a reunification would have been in the '90s, but we didn't have a Helmut Kohl, not the littlest bit of foreign goodwill left, after the Romanian authorities reppressed the romanian opposition in 1990 in the famous 'mineriads'.

The neo-communist government in power waffled and flopped impotently, despite a lot of opening and goodwill from the moldovan side. The 'peacekeeping' mission the russians sent cemented the status quo after the moldovan-transnistrean civil war, so a political solution became increasingly less likely as time passed.

Now, we kinda drifted apart, and Moldova and moldovans have their own issues to decide upon. And even as those things are decided, there are geopolitical issues at play.

Greece should not expect any decisions from the European Union with regards to demands for stricter sanctions against Turkey over its recent actions in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Commission’s foreign policy chief indicated on Thursday.

In doorstep comments ahead of an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers in Berlin, Josep Borrell noted that “only political proposals” would be made during the conference, which will address developments in the Eastern Mediterranean as well as the situation in Belarus and the EU’s relationship with Russia.

“Everybody is focusing on what kind of decisions we will propose regarding sanctions,” Borrell said. “As you know, this is an informal meeting; it cannot take decisions, only political proposals that will be developed later.

“I think that the discussions will be important, because the level of the sanctions and who to sanction is something that needs to be fully considered,” he added.

Athens has called on Brussels to take a tougher stance toward Turkey, with government spokesman Stelios Petsas earlier on Thursday saying that it expected Borrell to present “a catalogue of sanctions” at the Berlin meeting.

You mean representing *you* above others?

By the same rational nobody can be trusted, or are you also implying that at the same time as having bias for Ireland, this commissioner is the only person with the integrity and professionalism to represent the needs of others?

The job at hand is one that fulfils the needs of the EU as a whole, whether that benefits some and harms others in the short term is weighed against the overall benefit to the Bloc.

What you are really saying it that Ireland is not very relevant at an EU level, and thus requires unfair, special treatment by way of a biased actor working within and on the behalf of Ireland... Its totally fine for adverse decisions to affect other people in other countries but not Ireland.


The trade commission is one of the most sought after roles in the EU, particularly now with the trade issues effecting relevant players like the USA and China. The EU needs a trade commissioner with a focus on the needs of the Bloc on a global scale, and the notion that this persons important GLOBAL decisions would be swayed by a tiny fraction of the EU is laughable.

3811,"That's really an Americanism, and IIRC we normally used ""czar"" when it started.

*googles*

Yeah.  Goes back further than I thought.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czar_(political_term)

&gt; Czar, sometimes spelled tsar, is an informal title used for certain high-level officials in the United States and United Kingdom, typically granted broad power to address a particular issue. 

-

&gt; The word ""czar"" is of Slavic origin, etymologically originating from the name ""Caesar"", as does the word 'tsar,' a title of sovereignty, first created and used by the First Bulgarian Empire. The title was later adopted and used by the Serbian Empire and Tsardom of Russia. 
&gt;
&gt;During the tenure of Joseph Gurney Cannon, he was sometimes referred to as Czar Cannon. This was a result of the power of the Speaker of the House during this time. However, there was a ""revolt"" in the House which saw Cannon give up power, as well an overall decentralization of power within the House.[2]
&gt;
&gt;During the latter stages of World War I, President Woodrow Wilson appointed financier Bernard Baruch to run the War Industries Board. This position was sometimes dubbed the ""industry czar"".[1]
&gt;
&gt;One of the earliest known metaphorical usages of the term in the U.S. was in reference to Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who was named commissioner of baseball, with broad powers to clean up the sport after it had been dirtied by the Black Sox scandal of 1919.[3]
&gt;
&gt;In 1926, a New York City chamber of commerce named what The New York Times termed a ""czar"" to clean up the milk delivery industry.[4]
&gt;
&gt;In the United States, the term czar has been used by the media to refer to appointed executive branch officials since at least the 1930s and then the 1940s under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[5][6][7] In 1942, The Washington Post reported on the ""executive orders creating new czars to control various aspects of our wartime economy.""[8] Positions were created for a transportation czar, a manpower czar, a production czar, a shipping czar, and a synthetic rubber czar, all to solve difficult problems in coordinating the resources necessary to fight World War II.[1][9] Not only did the administration of President Roosevelt advocate their creation; in December 1944, Republicans in Congress advocated that a ""food czar"" position be created that would have almost unlimited control over food pricing and distribution.[10] Certain of Roosevelt's Cabinet secretaries were called ""czars"", despite having been duly confirmed by the Senate, at the point that their powers were increased by statute.[6]

I dunno about ""stole"", though — I mean, it's using the term metaphorically to reference the literal sense of the word, like how one might use the term ""king"" to refer to someone who isn't really royalty today.

3815,"I found a couple of news articles and blog posts from the past 5 years that discuss the misinformation spread regarding the number of guns in Finland. During 2007, someone said it is 2,4 million guns. But this was apparently fake. This number would have made the guns per 100 people 43. The corrected more recent estimates say that there is approximately 1,5 million registered guns in 2016 (more than one million of which are for hunting), and the number is decreasing. In my personal experience, the tradition of hunting is declining and young people are not as interested in it as earlier generations. There are still some illegal guns from the wars that are not included in the calculations, but the numbers are estimated to be tens or hundreads of thousands, not millions. One article from 2018 says it is 1,8 million guns. So based on these something between 1,5 million (27 guns per 100) and 1,8 million (32 per 100) is probably most accurate. Technically it can still be more than 30 guns per 100, but probably not many years anymore.

I'm not against people being really, really, **really** rich. If someone invents some really innovative technology and manages to turn it into something extremely useful for society, then obviously that person deserves a bigger piece of the pie. If only because he's proven that he capable of putting it to good use. I'm fine with people being worth, say, a couple hundred million dollars. They'd still be able to live a life of absolute opulence, but that'd still be orders of magnitude away from being billionaires or god forbid, people with tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars. They would still be able to own several insanely big mansions all over the world, fill them all with permanent live-in staff and fly a private jet that they personally own to an from those mansions constantly. But billions tho.. I really fail to see how anyone could 'deserve' quite literally more money than they could spend in 10 lifetimes. Not to mention the level of power that comes with that kind of capital. They can lobby and pump enormous amounts of resources in convincing policy makers to serve their personal interests. I'm not against billionaires because I'm jealous (alright, maybe a tiny little bit haha), but mostly because no individual should have that much power.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/ih0iwj/number_of_billionaires_across_europe_source/g2zyqof/,King-O-Banality,1598511031

If goods and financial assets, as well as people, flow and operate globally, then what a large economy does has impact on the whole world. This does indeed translate into power, whether we want to use it explicitly or not. 

Similarly, everything that happens in the world does affect the EU eventually. If there is a terror wave in Nigeria people flee towards Europe, if there is a financial crisis in China the European economy tanks, if there is a civil war in Syria it creates space for religious insurgents that eventually terrorize Europe, if the Amazon burns in Brazil eventually the climate all around the globe is affected.

The entire Black Sea coast was captured by Russia in the Russian-Turkish wars. Crimea was presented to Ukraine by Khrushchev, Donbass was given by Lenin.  Lviv is Poland. Transcarpathia is Hungary, Bukovina is Romania. Ukraine is a tiny land in the circle of Kiev and several neighboring regions.

A nautical mile is 1/60th of a degree distance on the earth's surface from the center. It is also referred as a arc minute on the surface. This minute can also be split up in seconds. This is the basis of our coordinate system. And is used for all navigation. Be it ships or planes. The connection to the clock is with time zones. One time zone is 1/24th of the earth's radius. Or 15 degrees on the surface. Or 900NM on the equator. (standard time is again different since that's political and not mathematic)

Once the empire surrendered in WWI, the Unionist government collapsed and scattered into exile and hiding. At first, the incoming government was willing to cooperate with the allies, and a purge was conducted on Unionists. However due to the allies having a very liberal understanding of ""no occupation unless it is of strategic importance"" they continued occupying territory despite the armistice agreement. To the Istanbul government and most Turks, the allies were attempting imperialism instead of enforcing peace.

However, once Mustafa Kemal's movement started gaining steam, there were attempts of compromise and for both governments to join together and resist imperialist allied demands. Sensing where the wind was blowing, the allies forced the elected Ottoman Chamber of Deputies shut, and the Sultan, his cabinet, and his appointed senate had absolute power, though Kemal would even be able to infiltrate the senate. This meant the Sultan and Istanbul government became allied collaborators.

However in reality, the Istanbul government held almost no power outside of Istanbul. Anatolia was in practical anarchy, with local notables organizing into Defense of Rights Associations, and able bodied men organizing into irregular çetes (gangs) and Kuvayi Milliye millitias. These forces were without discipline, irregular, and (especially çetes) almost moblike, and would attack allied forces as well as Christian minorities (who could be allied collaborators too).

&amp;nbsp;

The Government of the Grand National Assembly: 

Known as the Ankara government was dominated by Mustafa Kemal Pasha, a war hero who was assigned by the Sultan to be inspectorate of the 9th army based deep in Anatolia. This meant he was to demobilize it and ""maintain order"". Instead, Kemal does the exact opposite of what he was ordered and organizes a resistance movement against the Allies powers, seeing them as more interested in imperialism than keeping peace. Officers ordered to arrest Kemal refuse, and Kemal unites various local Defense of Rights Associations into the Association for the Defense of Rights of Anatolia and Rumelia. Kemal then opens the Grand National Assembly, consisting of elected representatives of unoccupied provinces of the Ottoman Empire, based in Ankara, who all happened to be part of the ADRAR. Kuvayi Milliye and demobilized Ottoman army commands also start to pledge allegiance to Kemal, allowing for the organization of a regular army.

&amp;nbsp;

Greece 

Greece was a dictatorship under Eliftherios Venizelos, who sought to make the Megali Idea a reality, basically a pan-Greek state that would include lands of significant Ottoman Greek populations including Western Anatolia and the Black Sea coast (This dream was very unrealistic since these populations were often minorities in their own areas and would include a sizable Muslim Turkish population). The allies saw Greece as the best proxy to ensure order in Anatolia by promising Venizelos territory in exchange for employment of the Greek in keeping order. Upon the Greek Army landing in Izmir, cycles of atrocities immediately break out between the army and Ottoman Greeks vs Muslim çete gangs. The Greco Turkish war was the Western front of the war of independence, and is the most famous.

As the Ankara consolidated, the Greek army was sent deeper and deeper into Anatolia, becoming overstretched in hostile territory, and it was a matter of time before disaster. It is after the battle of Dumlupınar that the Great Offensive started, where the Turkish army pushed the Greek army out of Anatolia within the span of 3 weeks (which this post is commemorating).

&amp;nbsp;

UK: 

Gave significant financial and diplomatic support to Greece, British troops were not as active against the GGNA, however they did fight anti-British guerilla activity in Mosul, now Iraq (it wasn't set that Mosul would be Turkish or Iraqi post war of independence).

&amp;nbsp;

France: 

France occupied much of southern Turkey for their Syrian mandate, the Franco - Turkish war was also the southern front of the war of independence. France fought this war with their own troops as well as Armenian auxiliaries. As far as I know, Turkish forces fighting on this front weren't as integrated into the GGNA's army: it was mostly militias of irregulars that were nominally loyal to the GGNA. After Italy, France was the second major allied power to tacitly support Kemal's GGNA after the Turks beat them in Cilicia. 

&amp;nbsp;

Italy 

The Italians were originally to be allotted a large territory in Anatolia in the peace conference, and they had occupied provinces like Antalya and Konya. However there were conflicts between Italy and Greece's claim of the pie. When it became clear the allies would support Greece over Italy, Italy basically went rogue and gave financial and diplomatic backing to the GGNA very quickly. I don't know of what manor they evacuated Antalya and Konya.

&amp;nbsp;

Armenia:

Just coming out of a super dark time, Armenia declared independence around the end of the war. Some shenaniganry happens with the Transcaucasian federation too, however Armenia was supposed to become a League of Nations mandate under American protection, and they were awarded a large chunk of Eastern Anatolia. However The US senate famously not only rejects LoN membership, but also the Armenian mandate. Armenia had minimal support from the allied powers too, who were also the ones supposed to guarantee them a protected homeland in the first place. With the Armenians gaining some self defense, massacres of Turks and Muslims immediately started. Reprisals would turn the situation from a genocide into a hellish ethnic conflict. 

Eventually Kazim Karabekir, one of Ataturk's lieutenants, got his way and invaded Armenia jointly with the Bolshiviks, and they sign a treaty in which Armenia is partitioned between the two of them. This was the Eastern front of the war of independence.",,/r/europe/comments/ih75pu/the_great_offensive_started_today_on_26august1922/g2zv2x7/,qernanded,1598507836

4091,"[According to the 2011 census, 39% of Hungarians are Catholic, (37.2% Western Catholic and 1.8% Eastern Catholic) 13.8% are Protestants, (11.6% Calvinist and 2.2% Lutheran), 1.9% have Other religions or denomination, 18.2% have no Religion, and 27.2% refused to answer.\[1\]\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Hungary)

Comparing Christian values with ""Sharia law"" is ridiculous. Can you tell me one country that practices such thing as ""Christian Sharia""? Also, Christianity can't be compared to Islam. Jesus wasn't a military conqueror, but the prophet Muhammad was. The Crusades were a problem of the religious institutions. Not the teachings of Jesus. I don't agree with everything that's written in the Bible, but I agree with the core principles of Christianity. I see nothing wrong with that. It's a moral code that guides people to a path of tranquility and peace. It gives them hope and security that God is out there and he cares for them and supports them. It's entirely another topic that some people are religious fanatics who look down on non-believers and think that violence is justified if it's in the name of God. In my country we have a saying for this kind of people - ""The excessive saint isn't dear even to God"".

Orban doesn't ""shove his religious dick"". He has a stance that is pro-Christian. Looks like the bigger part of Hungarians are Christian(according to the census) and agree with him on that topic. There are others who are not Christian, but also agree. Of course there are many who don't. I personally don't support him as a politician, because he is corrupted and serves Hungarian oligarchs. I don't see how his conservative attitudes are such a trouble for you though? Are homosexuals persecuted by the country? No. They just don't have the right to officially marry and adopt children. LGBT parades are also allowed, even though there are some people there who dress up in disgusting outfits to openly praise perversions instead of homosexuality and human rights. Now I see that you are also labeling me as homophobe with the ""Also you couldn't help but mention homosexuality and perversion."" Remember the labeling I told you about? You just did it. If you read what I wrote it was ""sexual perversions(by that I don't mean homosexuality itself)"" By sexual perversion I mean this - [1](https://i.redd.it/u7v8bn4v1rh31.jpg) [2](https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/13x129_46fc_9-e1561500152601.jpg) [3](https://www.thetricolour.com/pictures/gay-pride-lgbt-ireland.jpg) [4](https://live.staticflickr.com/360/20207155568_47a3475418_b.jpg) [5](https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2018/07/Trump_Protest_8.jpg) Kids shouldn't be exposed to this filth.

4122,"There was no such thing as fighting for greater Armenia aside from Western Armenia. Only push was for Cilician Armenia. You are probably thinking of Sevres Treaty and Wilsonian Armenia, but that didn't involve any fighting, it was just a treaty which was not ratified and a proposal in US congress which didn't pass. Also Armenia never attacked Turkey. It was the Nationalist Turkish forces which attacked Armenia which had declared independence within territories belonging to the Russian Empire and not to the Ottoman Empire. 

Marash did involve Armenian fighters as part of French forces **but it also involved many more civilian survivors of the genocide, many of whom were massacred**, although some survived by the French taking them to France via the sea. 

Death marches were one of the acts of genocide, bulk of the destruction against the women, children and the elderly civilians. The other was direct executions of the able-bodied men direct in their villages/towns, or in the army while being conscripts, direct massacres, which Marash is one example under Ataturk. Another was forcefully taking women and especially children into Muslim households, something which Ataturk blessed by at least not taking any action to undo. As for the last remaining genocidal act which is causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, this didn't end even when the Republic of Turkey was established. The only genocidal act Ataturk wasn't involved in was deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, at least not as a death march.

Ataturk not only didn't reverse any of the damage done to the Armenian nation, but was the commander when massacres were committed against Armenia both in the case of Marash, as well as in places such as Kars, reversed provisions such as those in Sevres Treaty which sought to undo forced taking of women and children, and those who were forced to cover to Islam, among many other provisions to right the wrongs CUP had inflicted upon the Armenian nation. In another comment I copied one of these provisions.

The issue is one (3MW) cost around 4 Million  € is build in a mere month, can compete in low price enviroments and is turning a net profit in around 12 years.  Calculated after average load hours 2800h (2018) and whole sale prices(40€MW/h) in Germany. We earn  336 000€ annually.

A nuclear plant did average back then in Germany 8 years in build time(quite shorter than current nuclear plants in Europe)

Let's take a average cost 10 billion €. As power plants cost vary heavily and the plants build nowadays in Europe are a bad example. It's pretty much around the prices nuclear advocates want them built. 

So nuclear has around 8000h (even though often less, especially older plants)

with the 40€ MW/h and I'm generous a capacity of 1600 MW. That will pay for itself in 20 years of Generation.   512 000 000 € profit annually. 

So after 28 years until you make profit. But then we make more than a winturbine or not?

If we build windturbines for the money of one nuclear reactor we could build 2500 of them.

So we have 840 000 000 annual profit after 12 years with windturbine

or 

we have 512 000 000 with nuclear after 28 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

We could aslo look of the plenty studies or the LCOE.

After the Turks got hold of Smyrna(shown in the painting above) a few days after the Greek army departed, they set fire to the Greek and Armenian quarters of the largely Christian city and between 10k-100k people died as a result.

Which is a gross misrepresentation.

There are many small towns with 600mbps offerings, although the pace has slowed significantly, because they have been forced to resell their last mile fiber (which is the expensive part). Consumers got much cheaper and better connections, Movistar rushed to get the debt down through every mean possible, and in the foreseable future they'll think twice if a similar opportunity comes along.

I am saying that their profits are so wildly out of proportion with their actual contributions it's quite frankly ridiculous. And I am saying that a system in which there are no capitalists has the potential to be fairer than our current one.

4225,"A lot of people misunderstand the history of Turkish independence. Spoiler alert this is long and I am not salty or pissed I just want people to understand before judging. First off, Atatürk didn't kill the Armenians. During 1914 to 1918, he was either in Dardanelles or in Aleppo and Damascus fighting against the Allies for the most part. Those places weren't where the Armenians were iirc. Between 1918 to 1923, he was busy fighting a war against the British, French, and Greeks along with a few others. If you want someone to blame, blame the 3 pashas in power at the time of WW1. Atatürk wasn't part of them and actually said himself that the Ottomans who carried it out deserved punishment after doing the genocide on Armenians. Those 3 pashas did dream of a fully Turk empire and weren't afraid to genocide. Fortunately, they all were killed by Armenians when trying to flee Turkey after failing. Also small fun fact Armenians/people of Armeni descent helped in making the Turkish language. One well known one is ""Dilaçar"" which is the last name he was given by Atatürk which means language opener. 2nd, the ""Greek ethnic cleansing"" often brought up by Greeks is misunderstood. Both sides agreed to exchanging both Greeks and Turks to the other. What seems like ethnic cleansing nowadays was seen in the past as a solution for peace according to the league of nations. Unfortunately, it didn't bring peace between the 2 countries as we can see rn with Cyprus divided and the Eastern Mediterranean EEZ violations. Atatürk was able to beat 2 global powers along with many other countries invading Turkey so we respect him greatly. He gave us the nation we are in. The lives we have rn. Also there is a misconception where he named himself Atatürk but that is false. We did.

Turkey's standpoint that the Greek islands should be ignored for the delineation of the EEZ's is problematic before any negotiations could take place. If Turkey could compromise on that, then Greece could compromise on on *how much* EEZ certain islands nearest to the Turkish coast can generate, to give an example.

Greece is asking for such a discussion, but on the conditions that Turkey would cease the exploratory surveys in the meantime. As a gesture of goodwill.

4571,"About how reactors in South Korea are kept cheaper:

&gt; **South Korea has indicted 100 people, including a top former state utility official, of corruption in a scandal over fake safety certifications for parts in its nuclear reactors**, authorities said on Thursday.

&gt;Asia’s fourth largest economy has faced a series of shutdowns of nuclear reactors due to fake documents going back to late 2012. Of its 23 reactors, six remain offline, including three halted in May to replace **cables supplied with bogus certificates.** 

[Source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-korea-nuclear/south-korea-charges-100-with-corruption-over-nuclear-scandal-idUSBRE99905O20131010)

&gt;Prosecutors discovered that thousands of counterfeit parts had made their way into nuclear reactors across the country, backed up with forged safety documents. KHNP insisted the reactors were still safe, but the question remained: was corner-cutting the real reason they were so cheap?

&gt;After the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, most reactor builders had tacked on a slew of new safety features. KHNP followed suit but later **realized that the astronomical cost of these features would make the APR1400 much too expensive to attract foreign clients.**

&gt;“They eventually removed most of them,” says Park, who now teaches nuclear engineering at Dongguk University. **“Only about 10% to 20% of the original safety additions were kept.”**

&gt;[...] “Suppliers who were supposed to be competing with one another colluded to decide who would win [KHNP bids],” Kim told me. “You’d have a group of white-haired executives from competing firms sitting across from each other, playing rock-paper-scissors to decide who would take certain contracts.” Dummy bids would then be supported by fake documents, doctored to ensure that the designated loser would fail. On one occasion, he says, an irate KHNP procurement manager **called him to point out an amateurish forgery in a fake bidding document—and demanded he do it again, properly.**

4696,"SUMMARY

France, Germany, and Sahel countries launched the Sahel Alliance in 2017 with the aim of bringing together major international donors to better coordinate development assistance and other financing efforts for the region.

The Alliance aimed to integrate security, development, and governance perspectives but has struggled to find coherence and effectiveness – although it has adopted some novel approaches.

The worsening security situation in the Sahel led international actors to then set up new initiatives, including the Partnership for Security and Stability in the Sahel and, more recently, the Coalition for the Sahel. However, the relationship between these initiatives remains largely theoretical, with the practicalities of cooperation and burden sharing yet to be fully defined.

These new initiatives risk privileging security solutions to complex problems, meaning that necessary governance reforms may fall by the wayside. This is despite widespread acknowledgement, including from senior French officials, that there is no purely military solution to the varied conflicts and challenges in the Sahel.",Luxembourg,/r/europe/comments/ih0arm/disorder_from_chaos_why_europeans_fail_to_promote/g2wyuw1/,JackRogers3,1598453724

4759,"&gt; Now I could point out that the moments where private investment has been much more inefficient(like Germans private outflows during last 20 years) or that market is cyclical and if there is no government who can provide anti-cyclical spending the crises get worse etc etc. But this is going to be ideological debate, which would be waste of time. 

Fair enough. But I can point out an array of literature that says that ""anti-cyclical  spending"" has either zero effect or makes the things worse. This is not admitted within most of the academic sphere since they despise Austrian &amp; Chicago school of economics.

 

&gt;On the other side they have a mostly non-tradable service and construction sector riddled with part-time **foreign** workers. Switzerland especially depends on foreign labour, 30% of swiss workforce are foreign citizens. This workers enjoy much worse protections, are exposed to higher unemployment and are more likely to work ""gig"" part-time jobs.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Switzerland dominates in part-time jobs.](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/product?code=tesem100)

I disagree here. ""Non-tradable"" service and construction sectors in Switzerland pays proportionally higher, compared to the purchasing power, than any other EU country. In Zürich a supermarket worker earns in the 4000-4400 CHF range whereas a construction worker is above 5000 CHF per month. Also, it's false to say that these workers enjoy ""much worse protections"": they have exactly the same protections as a PhD working in Pharma.  The part-time jobs in Switzerland are not viewed negatively by workers in Switzerland, on the contrary. Many working moms simply prefer less working hours and high-skilled workers not far from retirement does ""80%"" or ""50%"" jobs to have more free time. Since in Switzerland income taxes are low, even a part-time job is enough to sustain a decent life style.",,/r/europe/comments/igdrvs/which_economists_have_given_good_responses_to/g2wl0nj/,DyTuKi,1598446015

4861,"&gt;Ahahahah what? Care to provide any proof that is not a statistic by the Soviet Government?   
&gt;  
&gt; The annual average growth rate of Soviet GNP since 1928 is 4.2 percent. This clearly qualifies as a sustained growth record. However, there has been a sharp decline over time. In recent decades Soviet GNP growth rates have declined more than half, from 5.7 in the 1950s to 2.0 percent in the early 1980s. From about one-quarter the size of the U.S. economy in 1928, the Soviet economy climbed to about 40 percent in 1955, 50 percent in 1965, and about 60 percent in 1977. Soviet GNP per capita was also catching up, reaching 52 percent of the U.S. level by 1975. However, this pace has slowed drastically in the past two decades and even reversed itself in recent years. In spite of some relative Soviet advancement, the absolute gap between the two economies is now widening.

The German invasion was a direct result of the war waged by Italy. Until it happened, Greece was placing itself to remain neutral similar to how Turkey was. By that time, Europeans (incl. Italians) were well aware just how brutal the Nazi occupations were.

So Italian invasion directly lead to the German invasion which lead to a (well established by then) pattern of Brutal occupation and deliberate mass starvation of the civilian population to prevent mass scale resistance and also to feed the German armies. That directly caused that many deaths.

The brits also bombed civilian buildings as part of their training and their bombings of roads and railways caused hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths, including the deaths of many in concentration camps and PoW camps which were cut of from food and medicine",Bavaria (Germany),/r/europe/comments/igtj6n/in_1940_the_italian_fascist_government_was/g2wcsuz/,AyyStation,1598439428

&gt;In Italy, labour exploitation, including forced labour, predominately affects migrant workers in agriculture, textile production, construction,4 and domestic work. 5 Research conducted in 2016 revealed that migrant workers in the agriculture sector and domestic work frequently face exploitative working conditions, ranging from violation of contract provisions through to severe abuse and trafficking for labour exploitation and forced labour.6 The agriculture sector, particularly in the less developed southern part of Italy where most of the country’s farms are situated, has been known for years to rely on cheap and exploited migrant labour.7 These workers are reportedly subject to some forms of exploitation and abuse, such as not receiving adequate remuneration, being charged to use transport provided by employers, having their passports and identity documents confiscated by middlemen or labour brokers called caporali, being forced to live in the place where they work, which exacerbates isolation and segregation that in turn increases vulnerability to human rights abuses, and being subject to inadequate or even inhumane living conditions.8, 9 The media has described workers being paid only 2 Euros an hour (US$2.32)10 with no legal employment contract or health insurance,11 while research conducted in 2016 identified that workers in Sicily could be paid between 15 Euros per day (less than 2 Euros per hour) through to 50 Euros per day in the agriculture sector.12",,/r/europe/comments/iggssz/on_25th_august_1256_the_city_state_of_bologna/g2w5dx5/,bERt0r,1598431649

Then we had a major famine, we had constant slaughters because of resistance killing Germans and Germans killing civilians for counter-measures. Then because all our government structures were gone, we had a civil war that killed hundreds of thousands more and scars Greece to this day.

And all because Mussolini couldn't keep it in his pants.

4990,"&gt; I like the last one where the straight couples have advantage if they are more or less equal to a gay couple. 

Great. Let's see how that compromised will be perceived by the two groups. I imagine that at least some conservatives will still do not like because it still allows for the *possibility* of gay couples adopting, but most might accept it because they know there are so many straight couples who want to adopt, so their list is much longer. And for gay people, how do you think they will react to being said ""we know you are more or less as suitable to be parents as a straight couple, but we will prefer straight couples and only consider you when we run out of straight couples"".

So, this solution is a compromise that gives almost everything the conservatives are asking for (almost no child ending up with gay parents if we can possibly avoid it), and only a tiny bit to gay people (the law doesn't *prohibit* you from adopting a child, but it says that no matter how good you would be as parents according to CWS evaluations, the fact that you are a gay couple will always be a disadvantage for you, and you will only be considered as a last resort). 

So, this compromise is not a middle ground. It's so much closer to what the conservatives want (only asking them to accept that in theory, yes, gay people could become adoptive parents), and only give a tiny bit to the other side (making it legally possible, but still judges them much more severely than it judges equally good straight parents). It will be very hard to make gay people accept that this is fair or a substantial step forward, so they will probably not enter such a negotiation.",Cyprus (self-isolating in DE 🇩🇪),/r/europe/comments/ig9hbh/poland_education_minister_defends_official_who/g2w5y4h/,agrammatic,1598432264

To me , the structural exploitation of ireland is not a nationalist motivated narrative, just historically evident, deforestation was something that began when humans first settled the island, but you can’t argue industrialism did not finish the job , and as ireland was administered by Britain I see that continuing administration and the Industrialization it brought leading to it as a beneficiary, its wealth having come about from the exploitation of many places , including its own island but not limited to it, but I am willing to change my mind or at least inform myself better with an actual source.

Maidan was marked as strongly pro-West with people viewing West and Western approach as the approach to emulate.

From what I have saw and read, this doesn't seem to be the case in Belorussia and it seems to me that even the ruling elite is throwing Lukashenko under the bus as a convenient scapegoat. But the economical and political situation is such that there will be the pro-Russian government. I suspect that Putin will throw Lukashenko under the bus as well and instead support the Belorussian army (with Russian-educated officers) and ruling elite through economical ties to help stabilize the situation, which will give him massive influence.

5240,"I can't help but interject into what is being said here, what /u/idio3 is saying is simply wrong and his attempt to distance himself from the insanity of his fellow comrades is a historical pattern of all naive idealistic communist intellectuals. It was people like him/her who help make violent revolution possible, and they are the first to be executed by their fellow ""comrades"" historically, reason being that they are the most dangerous to the new dictatorship as they understand the most about the rationale behind it. Communism doesn't make sense ""in theory"" or ""on paper"", it totally misconstrues reality. For one thing that ""theory"" is based on the presupposition that [power law distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law) in wealth are somehow ""unnatural"", or that there is a causal relationship between that kind of inequality and systemic problems of poverty and low class mobility. The reason for such distribution is simply because capital invested compounds on itself, which is why capital naturally flows to the the top percentile of productive people. The richest people don't have several orders of magnitude more wealth because they're that much more productive, but because they are a tiny bit more productive than the next guy. Those tiny increases in productivity compound on themselves over the long term resulting in ultimately massive differences in total output. Such a distribution seems destructive or unfair until you gain control of your emotions, and realize that we all benefit from capital that we don't own every day. Such distributions in wealth are inevitable if the goal is for humanity as a whole to progress as fast as possible.

Also automation doesn't lead to widespread unemployment, never has never will. Sometimes governments attempt to delay the movement of labor from one sector to another by subsidizing peoples jobs, but like a currency peg eventually it breaks or snaps like a rubber band, this will cause a short period of mass unemployment. But that is not the fault of automation, but of foolish attempts to engage in central planning in labor markets. Luddites always say ""X new technology is different"", but it never is. What causes unemployment is bureaucratic red tape and central planning schemes, and the economic fallout of interest rate manipulation and money printing. In America after the 2008 mortgage crisis, a Hollywood movie came out called ""The Big Short"". That movie explains that the credit ratings agencies were selling good ratings for junk mortgage securities to the highest bidder, but the movie conveniently leaves out the fact that all these ratings agencies were given a monopoly by the US government. By law you had to use the government approved rating agencies. I'm not even saying this was done intentionally or that there is some communist conspiracy in Hollywood, it is just a product of Hollywood painting a picture as they wanted to see it. Nobody who makes these movies ever goes into the research process thinking ""I wonder if it was the governments fault"", they all just assume the problem is some inherent flaw of a market economy and they find the evidence that fits their assumptions.

We are on the verge of a global sovereign debt crisis, the bond market has been absolutely destroyed in Europe by this ludicrous negative interest rate ""experiment"". Be wary because the bankruptcy of governments around the world is already being marketed by neo-communists as a failure of ""capitalism"".",Diet America™,/r/europe/comments/ig9add/flight_of_the_navigator_armed_lukashenka_searches/g2vhlzc/,LateralusYellow,1598411770

Lets instead focus on Switzerland. It suffers from exactly the same problem as Germany. A relatively strong manufacturing sector + expanded export-oriented service sector, where workers are mostly educated and the jobs are highly productive with sufficent protection.

On the other side they have a mostly non-tradable service and construction sector riddled with part-time **foreign** workers. Switzerland especially depends on foreign labour, 30% of swiss workforce are foreign citizens. This workers enjoy much worse protections, are exposed to higher unemployment and are more likely to work ""gig"" part-time jobs.

You're definitely right that the search for another fuel source partly led to industrialisation though.

Most of the loss of the UK and Ireland's forest come down to prehistorical events as our ancestors burned down forests en masse to create better hunting grounds (hence the Moors) and the introduction of agriculture and domesticated animals from Europe.

5385,"Hi, Belarusian here.

Thank you very much Czech Republic for your support. It is \*very\* important.

An enormous pressure is put on Belarusian workers right now. Belarus has a large government sector - all major companies, factories are controlled by the government. It is like \~80% of the Belarusian workforce employed by the government. And Lukashenko's government actively uses its monopolistic power to oppress people to stop them going to anti-Lukashenko demonstrations. Factory directors threaten workers to fire without any pension or unemployment benefits. Some protest activists even put to a jail.

Most Belarusian workers feel fear, injustice. They feel that they are left 1:1 with this crazy dictator. They feel that they will be punished for its political views and afraid to go outside to manifestations.

Support like this is \*extremely\* valuable.

First of all this is financial support to people who have been fired for its demand of fair elections. Belarus is not a rich country, an average worker earns \~300-400$ in Minsk and 150-300$/month in a province. Even a small amount of help will be a great relief to them.

Second - spread the word about this help. Please contact https://tut.by (the major internet news site) or [https://t.me/nexta\_live](https://t.me/nexta_live) (popular Telegram channel about the protest movement) and tell about it.

Musk did not make is money in South Africa and was not living there any longer. Why cherry pick one individual?

&gt; Because they can do same and achieve same? 

We live in a world of finite wealth, we can not all be wealthy/successful. The more I have, the less most other people have. Those at the top protect their wealth from those at the bottom and seek to grow it indefinitely.

&gt; That's not how it works, to invest 20 million you need to get it somewhere. And if you tax everything, people who want to earn 20 million will move elsewhere. And you'll end up with bunch of people who inherited their millions from someone and are not capable of doing anything useful.

Historians can be whatever faith they like or of no faith. But it shouldn't distort the clear factual information we are dealing with.

Take your 'source' for example. Not only is it 20+ years old so missing out on the more modern analysis of things like Tacitus for example, but it's actually not a peer reviewed paper. It's just a rehashing of the old established narrative from the time.

This is an extensively researched area and the facts when you boil down to them are really clear. But there is just a ton of shit like the 'academic source' you just cited muddying the waters.

It's not that complex. There is nothing from the time that mentions Jesus Christ and stuff from the time that doesn't. That's it. That's all it boils down to.

Want to claim he existed anyway? Well fine you do that. Doesn't make it true and as we move away from faith based cultures the clearer the waters get.

5491,"Scholars and historians are not different things, a scholar is ""A specialist in a particular branch of knowledge"", per my dictionary. A religious scholar and a historian are different things yes, but I did not mention religious scholars. I'm not sure where your idea comes from that religious scholars are so greatly unwilling to critique or doubt the text they study, even if it is a text relevant to their faith. Critical examination of anything should be part of the education a scholar receives, religious or not.

The source I mentioned, whereas you have to mention any source except for your own opinion, is a history book (books aren't usually peer reviewed). Written by a historian, using historical facts.

You keep saying that this is such a researched area, and you mention that Tacitus is wrong and whatnot, yet any source I find mentions the exact opposite. Take Graham Stanton, again this is a little older from 2002, but you haven't cited any sources what so ever, so I'll still use it:
""Today, nearly all historians, whether Christians or not, accept that Jesus existed and that the gospels contain plenty of valuable evidence which has to be weighed and assessed critically. There is general agreement that, with the possible exception of Paul, we know far more about Jesus of Nazareth than about any first or second century Jewish or pagan religious teacher.""

Now if you show a source more compelling, better researched and more recent than Stanton, a Cambridge professor as well as a very distinguished academic, then I am more than welcome to change my opinion. However, you haven't. 

But let's see someone more recent then:

Bart Ehrman (a secular agnostic) wrote: ""He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees."" written in 2011 (Forged : writing in the name of God)

I don't claim he existed. Various very believable historians and authors do so. I won't go into the details of why your analysis of

&gt;There is nothing from the time that mentions Jesus Christ and stuff from the time that doesn't. That's it. That's all it boils down to.

Is incorrect, the sources I stated above will more than explain it for you.

Finally, none of these points have anything to do with the existence of God. I am personally not a religious person, and if you believe that all religions are bullocks then that's just fine and dandy, but you're still wrong in your belief about the current acceptance and views of historians on Jesus's existence.",,/r/europe/comments/igc3az/archeologists_just_found_an_1800_year_old/g2urcwh/,MarechalRouget,1598397270

The loss of forests was a major factor in the development of the industrial revolution as far as I remember. The price of charcoal led to people looking for alternative fuels, leading to Abraham Darby discovering that coke worked and started using it to produce iron. Coalbrookdale became a centre of Iron production, which drew John Wilkinson to the area who in turn later made major developments in regards to replaceable parts and the Boulton and Watt engine, as well as building the world's first iron bridge in the town of Ironbridge

5573,"&gt;The EU’s expert group says its criteria are science-based and designed to give incentives to bring about the rapid emissions cuts needed to give the world a chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change. 

Note the word ""rapid"" before ""emissions cuts"". 

Even convinced nuclear enthusiasts will admit freely that the energy source has wildly under-performed throughout the last decades when it comes to adding and replacing clean energy capacity. Due to the way the carbon in the atmosphere interacts with the biosphere, it is imperative to reduce emissions as fast as possible starting right now, since natural carbon sinks can buy time for the remaining emissions and hopefully avoid a self-reinforcing warming effect, time we can use to move towards carbon neutrality/negative emissions.

Based on current and recent performance, nuclear plants will require many years of planning and construction along with incredible risk of delays and cost overruns. Therefore, they are not suited to achieve *rapid* emissions cuts at all. Those are the ones we need.

The exclusion of nuclear power, even if accepted as sustainable in other ways, then is not a real issue. 

Aside from that, investment costs for nuclear power plants are so great that eligibility for EU green investment funds or labels was *not* going to be a deal breaker for their viability.",-6 points 9 minutes ago,/r/europe/comments/iggavr/gas_and_nuclear_industries_fight_to_the_end_for/g2ub5ud/,Bojarow,1598388782

PARIS (AP) — It was a picture postcard meant to portray unity in the vast and fragile lands that once were French colonies: President Emmanuel Macron standing with the leaders of five West African countries where France has spearheaded a counter-terrorism war since 2013.

“We are all convinced that victory is possible,” Macron said at the summit in Mauritania.

That was less than two months ago. Today, one of the five leaders has fallen. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, the president of Mali — the country at the center of the battle against Islamist extremists — was ousted last week in a coup d’etat. But an unflinching Macron is pressing on, refusing to withdraw France’s 5,100 troops from West Africa, even though extremist attacks have multiplied and victory looks like a mirage in the crescent-shaped sand dunes for which France’s Operation Barkhane is named.

“Operation Barkhane ... continues,” French Defense Minister Florence Parly tweeted last week, after the bloodless coup in Mali by a clutch of military officers who detained Keita and his prime minister. France’s swift response showed its determination to maintain a military presence in West Africa remains intact despite pockets of anti-French sentiment and questions about whether this could become France’s endless war.

As coup leaders promise a transitional government of uncertain length, there is nothing sure about the allies or enemies of tomorrow in a region where ethnic loyalties count and Islamist extremists have spread across porous borders. Keita himself once warned Macron that extremist groups in West Africa are “an enemy with a thousand faces.”

The captive Malian ex-president formally resigned and the military junta that took over has stressed its wish for French and U.N. forces there to continue their job.

But with the removal of Keita, past guest at France’s Elysee Palace, the only constant is Macron’s doggedness.

Macron made Mali his first foreign visit — a week after his election in 2017 — putting at the top of his agenda the anti-terrorism fight in a region where France holds enormous sway.

Beyond security, “the French want, I think, to stay influential in their former colonies and have this leadership in this sort of global division of labor” by major powers, said Yvan Guichaoua, a Sahel expert at the University of Kent’s Brussels School of International Studies. “It’s a way to perpetuate the narrative of French grandeur among French public opinion ... We’re still a big power.”",,/r/europe/comments/igi9ij/french_troops_stay_in_mali_after_coup_no_end_in/g2tut51/,quixotic_cynic,1598380916
5603,"[2]

But, he cautioned, “The longer you stay, the greater the chance that you become part of the problem.”

France has long had an outsized role in the five nations embroiled in the counter-terrorism effort in the Sahel region, its African backyard until decolonization in the 1960s. Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania remain tied by numerous accords to France, which maintains military bases and pumps in aid. France has 600 million euros ($708 million) in aid projects underway in Mali alone, according to the French Development Agency official in charge of Mali, Nicolas Mora.

A succession of French presidents has worked to shed the nation’s image as West Africa’s gendarme, and Macron and his ministers take pains to underscore that Paris’ largest overseas military operation is wanted by the African countries and approved by the U.N. The French goal is to stabilize Mali and then allow troops of the region to take over.

France first intervened in northern Mali in Jan. 2013 to push back al Qaida-linked extremists who controlled swaths of the north and imposed their harsh interpretation of Islamic law. It was hailed as a liberation force as soldiers freed Timbuktu and other towns. But as years passed, killings mounted, al-Qaida replaced lost leaders and an Islamic State offshoot arose. Violence spread to neighboring Niger and Burkina Faso.

Today, some see the French as occupiers with a hidden imperialist agenda.

Anti-French protests erupted last fall, a message that so worried Macron he called a summit in January with the leaders of the G5 nations, demanding they clarify their commitment to the French intervention.

“France isn’t there with neocolonial, imperialist aims or with economic goals,” Macron said ahead of the summit. “We’re there for the collective security of the region, and ours.”

But France’s presence has become increasingly unpopular in Mali as the violence that has undermined security in the West African nation since 2013 has not abated. Thousands in Mali have protested against France’s presence, often referring to their presence there as an “occupation.”

At Friday’s rally to support the coup, Malians carried signs decrying the former colonizer: “This is not a coup d’etat. It’s a revolution of the people,” “Stop the genocide by France in Mali,” “Death to France and its Allies,” and “Down with France and its governor.”

Africa specialist Marc-Antoine Perouse de Montclos disputes Macron’s contention that an international terror network in the Sahel puts Europeans at risk.

In his book “A Lost War, France in the Sahel,” he contends that French authorities have ignored local realities, like inter-communal vengeance and armies operating brutally with impunity, to promote the narrative of jihadis with direct links to Iraq and Syria.

A future French exit strategy may be as elusive as victory, according to him.

“When do you decide the jihadi threat is weak enough?” Guichaoua asked, and local armies are strong enough to take over the job? “We need measurable criteria.”

The head of the French joint chiefs of staff, Gen. Francois Lecointre, conceded that determining the end of engagement will be “complicated.” He foresees no victory hurrah.

“We will never achieve definitive victory,” Lecointre said on France-Inter radio. “Never will the armies march as victors under the Arc de Triomphe.”",,/r/europe/comments/igi9ij/french_troops_stay_in_mali_after_coup_no_end_in/g2tuv0u/,quixotic_cynic,1598380941

Sea territory is defined by equidistance from the closest shore. According to international law, islands have the same rights as any other land territory.

Why can't Turkey be confined? Facts don't care about your feelings. What's so special about Turkey? I understand that you have nothing else to project, no legal basis, but most people usually treat ""might is right"" doctrines as bullying rather than treating it with respect. 

Greece claims the area based on UNCLOS which is considered customary law by all countries in the world, even USA and Israel that are not signatories.

What's the legal basis behind Turkey claims? Not liking geographic reality?

I'm looking for an answer like: Turkey claims that this area belongs to them according to THIS SPECIFIC LAW.

Please replace THIS SPECIFIC LAW with something other than :

""You can't confine Turkey""

""Turkey will not accept that""

Jokes aside, I kinda feel bad for the Dwarves in Tolkien's universe. They did commit some war crimes (such as slaying Thingol and ravaging Doriath), but hey, they were corrupted by the Silmaril, and everybody in the First Age committed war crimes. 

And after that, they basically became centrists, wanting to just mine for God's sake. However, after the Rings of Power were made, the Dwarven rings corrupted them, and they mined too deep and too greedily, coming across a Balrog, which forces them to abandon their main mansion, the Dwarrowdwelf. 

They get a *sort of* happy ending in Return of the King, with Erebor restored, the Iron Hills, and Gimli's new colony, which makes me feel less sad, but they are a fraction of the power of the Men and Elves. 

Also, Gimli goes to Valinor, which means that he's eventually bound to come across Aulë himself, the Vala who created the dwarves. Imagine how cool is that! Maybe Gimli even learned some new skills from Aulë.

Investors in Belarus’s sovereign debt are growing jittery about the threat of international sanctions against the country in the wake of last Sunday’s disputed election.

A sell-off in Belarusian debt has accelerated in recent days as authorities continue their crackdown on protests against the contested victory for Alexander Lukashenko, which would continue the strongman president’s 26-year rule of the former Soviet state.

Dollar bonds issued by Belarus fell 2 per cent to 3 per cent in price on Thursday. A bond maturing in 2026, part of a $1.25bn sale of new debt by Minsk in late June, was trading at 93 cents on the dollar on Friday morning, having been issued at just below 99 cents.

Germany has led calls to impose EU sanctions on Minsk as the police response to initially peaceful protests has grown increasingly violent.

“The risk of sanctions is something we as bond investors have to be vigilant about,” said Sergey Dergachev, a portfolio manager at German asset manager Union Investment, who has sold some of his Belarusian bonds this week. “There’s a big question mark over how this situation will be resolved, and there’s likely to be more downside for the bonds until it is.”

Mr Dergachev said he thought sanctions that would prevent European investors participating in new debt sales by Minsk, or even trading its bonds in the secondary market, were very unlikely. However, he said EU sanctions targeting specific Belarusian officials were now his “base case”. 

The sell-off follows an initially muted reaction in markets even as opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya fled the country in the wake of the poll, which saw Mr Lukashenko awarded more than 80 per cent of the vote. Bond prices slipped slightly earlier this week but remained above levels seen in the run-up to the election.",,/r/europe/comments/igfv4e/belarus_bonds_dumped_by_investors_fearful_of_eu/g2tg4ba/,HappyPanicAmorAmor,1598374051

I don't think Belgium's method is 'excessive', just honest. It has been amply shown that anti-covid measures result in lower mortality from car crashes, job accidents, crime, other infectious diseases etc. This can explain the (negative) gap between Belgium's excess deaths and official covid deaths.

5772,"Your yardstick is meaningless. What more: combined with a meaningful measure, it *supports* the claim you say is ""completely incorrect"". 

First, a flat plateau is flat whether it is at 10 m or at 5010 m. If you elevate a flat surface by 5000 m, you do nothing to its flatness. You do something to its altitude, but that is not the same. 

To measure how flat or not it is, you need some measure of how it deviates from being flat-at-its-average. One would be highest minus lowest point (329 for NL, 294 for LT) - but if you insist on using average for something, here you go: 

* Netherland: deviates at most the difference 322 m - 30 m from its average of 30 m (according to you). 
* Lithuania: max deviation is the difference 294 m - 110 m (again, according to you).

292 is larger than 184.

There are adjustments you should make: a *large* near-flat country would have larger top-to-average distance than one of the same slope and smaller area.

Devshirmes were not slaves, contrary to claims here, they were subjects of the Sultans. Besides Ottomans was never called it blood tax, only central Europeans called it blood tax, possibly due to propaganda and inner consumption - since otherwise you can not find men for your holy war. Even the lowest ranked ones were paid handsomely (in gold coins). They can marry, have children and they can retire after 30-35 years of service if they demand. One of them married with Suleimans sister for example, the Ottoman princes. Now, compare it with serfs of Europe, which was about 70% of European population during the time of Janissaries. Being a Janissary is definitely much much advantageous than being a serf. A side note, European serfs were far more miserable than Ottoman commom slaves (not Devshirmes since they were not slaves). Check for example: https://youtu.be/pNfX_uJ4PRg

They were chosen especially for being viziers/advisors (like ministers today), the officer closest to Sultan and other high positions (Similar institutions were present in Persian and Roman Empire as well). The reason is that Ottomans actually despised Turkmens after Timurs invasion, so Turkmens (aka Turkey's Turks) has almost never have higher positions in Ottoman army. In fact Turks were mostly used as cannon fodders (look up Azabs).

I'd completely disagree with your third point, though. Being unable (or unwilling) to communicate at your audience's level is a great sign that you have poor communication skills.

5830,"From a BBC article:


&gt;It's important to make clear that Article 7 is a process rather than an end in itself.

&gt;And the process is divided into separate parts, with one not necessarily dependent on the other.

&gt;Under the preventative mechanism, the commission, the European Council or the Parliament can start the Article 7 process to determine whether there is a ""clear risk of a serious breach of EU values"".

&gt;The parliament has to agree by two-thirds of those MEPs who take part in the vote, which must also be an absolute majority of all MEPs, to start the process.

&gt;It then goes to the EU Council - the heads of government of the member states.

&gt;The council must agree by a four-fifths majority that there is a risk of breaching EU values (and then recommend specific actions to be taken by the country concerned).

&gt;European Parliament sources say there is no particular timeframe for this process - and that, in theory, the council could do nothing and simply ignore the vote by the parliament.

&gt;Sanctions

&gt;Under the sanctions mechanism enshrined in Article 7, only the council or the commission can trigger the process.

&gt;The council then has to decide unanimously that ""a serious and persistent breach of EU values has taken place"".

&gt;It has to also get the agreement of two-thirds of the parliament to this.

&gt;Once that has been done, the council has the power to suspend some of the country's membership rights - such as voting rights in the council itself.

&gt;However, it is not clear what other rights can be suspended.

&gt;And the council can only take this ultimate step by a qualified majority amounting to 72% of member states.

&gt;At the moment, this is not the course of action being proposed in the case of Hungary, although in theory that route remains open to the EU at a later stage.

The BUT is important, primeval or not. Most Swedish forests, when walking in them, feel like a real forest of randomly grown trees and wild under-vegetation, it's not at all like a flat field of crops growing in nice lines. 

There's often an exaggerated amount of pine trees compared to the natural mix, which is unfortunate, but it still feels like free wilderness. 

In Italy I would often see the trees lining up perfectly when driving by, i.e. they were planted in lines and left to grow long term, but IMO it was not a forest.
