9,"The only thing that stops russians from integrating, is the kind of chauvinistic pride that is inherent to large imperial powers and their titular nations. It would be unthinkable, if millions of chinese illegally cross the Russian border, build illegal settlements and then beginning to pressure Russian authorities to legalize mandarin as an official language and give political representation to all new chinese colonizers. It would rightly be considered invasion. 

Integration is not just up to estonians, at some point russians will have to do their part as well. These endless ""compromises"", where the russian minority refuses to make any concessions or meet half-way, leads to a situation, where Estonia (and the Baltics in general) just ends up self-russifying and thereby continuing Soviet era russification policies. 

The fact that russians aren't integrating doesn't necessarily mean that the balts have done anything wrong. At some point, you must accept that there are irreconcilable differences between these two ethnic communities and a compromise is impossible - one side must surrender to the other. And the balts obviously aren't gonna do that, because that would undermine their independence. They might as well have remained as the westernmost province of the Russian Federation.

But to be serious:

Until 12 years ago, there was no burden on the producers of chemicals to prove that they were safe. Anyone - and I mean ANYONE - could simply decide to introduce some new chemical in the market and we took it in good faith that it's not hazardous. As you realize, that led to multiple disasters, including the ozone layer depletion in the 80's.

&amp;#x200B;

Then the [EU introduced REACH](https://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach/understanding-reach) (came into force in 2007). The concept behind it is that the previous system is not sustainable and frankly, not safe at all. For the individual consumer and for the planet. The regulation had been negotiated for MANY years before its introduction and powerful lobbies watered it down to the bare minimum.

When REACH went into effect, because of the mere volume of work it required, it started with the most toxic compounds and those produced in the most massive quantities. There is some logarithmic scaling to finally register all the chemicals out there and to research their possible synergies (massive new problem, as we are constantly bombarded by thousands of chemicals which are usually studied in solo). That will take decades to complete.

4 or 5 years ago i would have considered  a single apartment in the middle of a larger city as too expensive if it would cost 400‚Ç¨ per month, there were cheaper ones available. today you will have a hard time to find a single apartment for 400‚Ç¨/month within 15km of that same city.

if your rental cost is below 400‚Ç¨ and you can reach your job with public transportation you can have a decent life with 1100‚Ç¨.

the issue here is, if you are unemployed you basically get 1000-1100‚Ç¨ from the state just to survive. no matter how well you can live with 1100‚Ç¨/month its just wrong that you are not better off compared to someone who does nothing. if it isnt possible to reduce the amount of benefit unemployed people get, there needs something to be done about low income. in my opinion it would be the best if the state would create some sort of progressive support for social insurance payments. in a way that someone who gets minimum wage doesnt have to pay any social insurance payments and with increasing wage it goes up to the ammount we have today for everyone.

The fact is that most russians, who are willing to integrate, have already done so. The rest have put their loyalty with the Russian Federation - that you think that this is somehow the fault of the balts is laughable and demonstrates, that you fundamentally do not understand the historical context and the circumstances of this minority.

102,"No, it is a cultural thing. Czechia like Austria (and I will guess Slovenia) share the same view because the opinion on homosexuality was formed in the 19th century, and the region shared the same penal code and education. The opposition to criminalization of same-sex relationship came from the scientific community around 1860s associated with medical and social studies, attached to a university of Prague or Vienna. In Bohemia, Purkyne wanted the change the penal code and his work influenced subsequent generations of scientists that homosexuality is a natural and unchangeable trait for a certain percentage of men and does not possess a threat to the society. People from one institution often taught at the other, and there was a constant exchange between these two. The push for legalizing same-sex relationship existed in Czechoslovakia and Austria for a while but was suppressed during WWII. However, in 1961, homosexuality in Czechoslovakia was decriminalized, based on research and work of medical science spanning to the time of Purkyne. Therefore, the cultural acceptance was formed a while ago, and affected the society for much longer. Slovakia which shared the same penal code like Czechoslovakia was not influenced by gay-friendly medical community unlike Prague, and its position until recently is rather conservative.",,/r/europe/comments/9sgq9t/young_adults_in_central_and_eastern_europe/e8rme07/,kaik1914,1540953334

So it's not a question of denying them the opportunities, it's a question whether society should support the kind of lifestyle where a person deliberately puts their child at a disadvantage from the get go. And to me the answer is a clear no. 

Having a child is a commitment to sacrifice 18-20 years of your life to support someone who can't support themselves.

410,"&gt;I'm responding to the argument that Russia is European because ""historically it's a European country which expanded into Asia."" I agree with your cringe, but I figured that the way to answer this argument was to look at the history of Russia and see if the argument had any merit. Even if you believe that history determines geography, I think this argument is questionable.

&gt;Does Russia consider itself European? This seems to be a question of some debate.

Russia is of European origin, it's not a spawn of a Khazarian steppe where Russia has later extended.

On the other hand, Hungary and Bulgaria originate from steppe dwellers, and both these countries are parts of the European Union. Only Hungarians have kept the original language though, Bulgarians blended with Thracians and some Slavs and adopted their language.

453,"&gt; Having gay rights makes you morally superior. There I said it. Giving equal human rights to a historically badly mistreated minority group makes you morally superior. They're still treated terribly in many countries in the world. You can replace ""gay rights"" with something else such as women's rights or animal rights. If women in Saudi Arabia aren't allowed to vote, but they are in Bulgaria, then I say Bulgaria is superior to SA in womens rights.

Who decides that? You? From your perspective, sure. You live in such a society where that is deemed normal and fine. But if you go into those countries you listed and ask them how they perceive it. you'll get an entirely different viewpoint. So what makes you think you are right and they are wrong?

&gt;Or if you can beat your wife in India if she doesn't listen, or force sex on her, but if you did the same in Bulgaria you would be thrown in prison, then Bulgaria is superior to India in that regard. Switzerland has very strict animal welfare laws, I'd say it's superior compared to most other countries when it comes to animal rights. It's really not that complicated.

It is. Because everything you described is your opinion on how things should be done. While I agree with you, the people of the Middle East do not agree with you on many of those things. Many Asian countries also do not agree with you. And it has nothing to do with how rich and how well off a country is, it's cultural and it is opinion based.

&gt;If you consider the fact that the vast majority of countries don't allow gays to marry, it definitely is an accomplishment. No need to downplay it because Bulgaria doesn't have it.

So again, why do you think you're right and they are wrong? The only reason I am annoyed is because people like you just can't help themselves but ""rub it in"" like having gay rights is something to strive towards to. Some countries do not want that and neither do they want to strive for it. 

&gt;You can also view it neutrally. If you look at gays from a neutral position, you'd give them the same rights as straight people have. By allowing gays to marry, you're not giving them any special treatment, nor are you discriminating against them. It's the neutral position if you think about it, but some people hate gays so much that they see even a neutral position as special treatment.

I do view them from a neutral position, I don't care about them one way or another, as I've already explained. But the fact of the matter is a society doesn't need to embrace homosexuality or other progressive rights like transexuality in order to be part of the ""cool kids club"" as people like you try to portray it. I don't care about your little club of progressive nations and I find it annoying that these threads pop up constantly as some sort of a reminder that Eastern Europeans need to embrace your attitude and culture.

Big countries are what ruined Lebanon's neighbour.  Lebanon is stably collapsed anyway, it has no functioning central government, it's a great example of anti-fragility.

But, yeah, Lebanon would never be incentivised enough to support Islamists in Syria the way that Turkey has, because the consequences come back so directly and at such a scale relative to Beirut.

471,"&gt;Oh, now we suddenly need the Russians? Our economy would be fine if we kicked the Russians out. Also we wouldn't kick all of them out only about 50-75% of them. Secondly our biggest political parties are keskerakond and reformierakond. Keskerakond is friendly to Russians and reformierakond is neutral about them. Don't really see how we aren't nice to them. Or at least we are nicer to them than they are to us. The Russians in Ukraine haven't been called colonizers yet they still haven't integrated. The Sudeten Germans in the Czech Republic weren't called colonizers and yet they never integrated despite living in there for thousands of years.




mate are you fucking kidding? Kicking out 75% of the Russians would absolutely devastate your economy or do you think that Narva pays taxes to Moscow? No country can afford to lose such a massive % of their population without consequences. Also this shows your fundemental misunderstanding of history so lets break this down. The Russian/ Russian speaking Ukrainians were perfectly integrated into Ukraine the issue was that they disagreed with the Ukrainian speaking Ukrainians on the direction in which to take the country the west wanted the EU the East wanted to get closer to Russia. And your point about Sudetenland is even worse. They lived under the German speaking Empires of the Holy Roman Empire and the Austrian Empire, hell they wanted to be a part of Austria when the Empire collapsed and a new Republic was declared but they were allowed to. The issue with Sudetenland is so radically different that I have no idea why you bring it up, they were never part of Czech society they were Austrians living in Austria until suddenly they weren't. Sure that's somewhat similar to the Baltics but even then that only leaves the integration time frame at what 20 years?







&gt;How can we integrate them in to our society if they don't live in our society? They live in their own communities in Narva and Tallinn.

**Arrival in Georgia in 2003 as ambassador of France, Salome Zourabichvili is today the surprising favorite of the presidential election held on Sunday in this country of the Caucasus, the last by a universal ballot.**

Extremely tight and organized in a tense atmosphere, the elections on Sunday will see Salom√© Zourabichvili, supported by the ruling party, Georgian Dream, have the main opponent of the opposition candidate Grigol Vachadze.

The position of president became largely symbolic, after the recent constitutional changes, but the election is seen as a test for the Georgian Dream, more and more unpopular.

It is the course of Salom√© Zourabichvili, born in Paris in 1952, of parents georgians who have fled their country in 1921, to escape the repression the bolsheviks, which has awakened the most interest and controversy in this election.

‚ÄúI always thought that I would help one day, at a certain level, this country to move towards democracy,‚Äù said in an interview with the AFP Salome Zourabichvili.

‚ÄúSeveral decades ago, a young diplomat French, I could not have imagined that I would be a candidate for the presidency in the country of my ancestors, which was then in the clutches of the soviet Empire,‚Äù adds the former diplomat.

A 66-year-old, who is currently mp independent, arrived in Georgia in October 2003, appointed ambassador to France by Jacques Chirac. Person is not considering, then, the political earthquake that was going to upset Georgia a few weeks later.

In November 2003, the Rose revolution, led by the pro-western Mikhail Saakashvili, pushes toward the exit of president Eduard Shevardnadze, after more than ten years in power.

Elected president in January 2004, Saakashvili, in search of experienced managers to integrate its administration and to carry out its promises to modernize the country, the ex-diplomat French his minister of foreign Affairs.

It is, however, soon accused of arrogance and impulsivity, even in the ranks of the majority, and loses the support of a party of diplomats and parliamentarians.

At the end of a year, Salome Zourabichvili is dismissed, despite protests against his departure, which bring together thousands of people in the streets of Tbilisi. The former diplomat joined the opposition and became one of the fiercest critics of Mikhail Saakashvili.

‚Äì The last general elections ‚Äì

The application of Salome Zourabichvili took off when it received the support of the billionaire ex-Prime minister, billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, who is suspected by many to continue to pull the strings of power in spite of its official withdrawal of the policy in 2013.

The main opponent of the ex-ambassador is another career diplomat: Grigol Vachadze, 60 years old, who was previously a diplomat in the soviet era and has also been head of the diplomacy of Mikhail Saakashvili, from 2008 to 2012.

On the bottom, the two favorites of the election converged on several points: both pushing for a rapprochement with the european Union and Nato, as Georgia asks in vain to reach for more than ten years.

But the campaign is hard. Supported by the united national Movement founded by Saakashvili ‚Äìnow in exile‚Äì and by ten other political formations, Grigol Vachadze accuses the ruling party of having failed to alleviate poverty in this country of 4.5 million inhabitants.

He blames especially the Georgian Dream to be corrupt and seek to use the resources of the State to consolidate its success at the polls. He also criticized the ‚Äúreign oligarchic informal‚Äù of Bidzina Ivanishvili, including the futuristic villa of glass overlooks ostensibly, the Georgian capital.

On his side, Salome Zourabichvili condemns malicious campaign against her, but also the authoritarian trends exhibited by the united national Movement during its years in power (2004 ‚Äì 2012).

Salome Zourabichvili, or Grigol Vachadze will inherit a position to be able to reduced. The investiture of the new president will mark the entrance into force of a new constitution in which the role of the president of the republic becomes essentially formal.

As soon as 2024, the president of the Republic of georgia will be elected by an electoral college of 300 members. Adopted in September 2017, this constitutional reform had been denounced by the opposition, who accused him of being built to serve the Georgian Dream.

The current president, Guiorgui Margvelachvili, elected with the support of the Georgian Dream, has refused to represent him because of this reform, ensuring not to want to play a secondary role in the political life of georgia.

Literally the next sentence after the one you quoted:

&gt;Although they are sometimes cited as more relevant socialist success stories, the experiences of the Nordic countries also support the conclusion that socialism reduces living standards. **In many respects, the Nordic countries‚Äô policies now differ  significantly  from  what  economists have  in  mind  when  they  think  of  socialism.** For instance,  they  do  not provide healthcare  for ‚Äúfree‚Äù; Nordic healthcare financing  includes substantial cost  sharing. Marginal labor  income tax rates in the Nordic countries today are only somewhat higher than in the United States, and Nordic  taxation  overall is surprisingly less  progressive  than  U.S.  taxes. The Nordic  countries also tax  capital  income  less  and regulate  product markets  less  than  the  United  States does.  However,  the  Nordic  countries do regulate and  tax labor  markets somewhat more; thus, American families earning the average wage would be taxed $2,000 to $5,000 more per year net of  transfers  if  the  United  States  had  current  Nordic  policies. Living  standards  in the 
Nordic countries are at least 15 percent lower than in the United States.

&gt;**It may well be that American socialists are envisioning moving our policies to align with those of the Nordic countries in the 1970s, when their policies were more in line with economists‚Äô traditional  definition  of  socialism.** We  estimate  that  if  the  United States were  to  adopt these policies, its real GDP would decline by at least 19 percent in the long run, or about $11,000 per year for the average person.

It goes on to say that they're less socialist today because their more socialist policies didn't work very well, which is the truth.

577,"&gt; It had to do with the fact that livestock make up 60% of all animals (including humans) on earth right now. Humans are 36% and the REST are 4% And yeah, the problem would be fixed in a few years, making humans make up 96% of all animals on the planet.

You are confusing animals with _mammal biomass_. Biodiversity is a sad topic, but it is far from as dramatic as you make it sound.

&gt; On your first point: No, it cannot feed more people than that. Nor do I have any desire to live on a planet that is 100% humans, and the rest is plants and bugs. (We'd probably eat those to extinction as well tbh) Nor would it stop deforestation, as we'd need more space to grow all these plants that will feed the ever growing human population.

I think you are underestimating the wastefullness of meat production. In many countries, most land is used to either keep cattle etc. or to produce soy and grains to feed those. The amazon rainforest for example is mostly being destroyed for those reasons. Everyone being vegetarian would significantly decrease the land we need to grow food (we already use more than we have to, because it is fed to animals) and end up increasing biodiversity + leave a lot of unused lands for animals.

&gt; There could be no more industry, there could be no more scientific progress, there could be no more technology.

Why would that be the case?

&gt; The only way to allow the population of the world to reach a decent quality of life, is to have LESS people. 

We don't even need most of the current population to maintain our way of life, improve it even, and this trend will just continue. Automation has made humanity several times more efficient in almost every way. Quality of life has increased for billions within the last few decades.

&gt; Third point: No, not missing the argument, you are not looking into it enough. You are advocating and end to industry, technology, scientific progress. Because all these things are dependent on heavy industry, mining, energy-needs. Take away all these industries and the unemployment would be MASSIVE.

Technological and scientific progress isn't much of a contributing factor to our current situation. Results of it are, yes, but not the research itself. That won't suddenly stop. Imagine the progress made if we would put a lot more money into researching ways to not go extinct. Most industries would still exist, just less ruthless, more sustainable. Those that are most unsustainable will die out anyway.

Industries would change and adapt. Some would disappear. The biggest change would be moving away from constant economic and shifting towards economic and environmental sustainability. I don't see how this would be bad. And I frankly don't care about jobs in industries we would be better off without.

With the move towards more sustainability, automation can become even more important. Research into that won't stop. Specialists on this field won't suddenly disappear either.

&gt; WHY is it a problem that we would no longer make up half of all living creatures on earth? How is that an issue? Why do you, personally, have a problem with this?

&gt; There is no way out of this mess, other than for people to stop fucking without a rubber so goddamned much.

I don't have a problem with having less people. I would be fine with 2 child policies in countries were it is feasible. The thing is, in those countries the average is below 2 children in the first place. And somehow those are also the countries that contribute and contributed to our current situation the most. So, if you are targeting those countries were the number is well above 2 children per woman, then you are simply targetting the poorest countries and poorest people.

641,"&gt; Oslo has poured cold water on a proposal from Tory MPs to adopt a Norway-style trading relationship with the EU to break the deadlock over Brexit and the Irish border. 
&gt; 
&gt; At a press conference in Oslo, Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg said allowing Britain to become a member of the EEA/Efta trading bloc, which has a very close relationship with the EU, would be ""difficult"" to accept. 
&gt; 
&gt; ""If you asked us if we would welcome Britain, we would welcome any good cooperation with Britain. But I don't think it's easy to think that you should - I know the British discussion - to enter into an organisation you are preparing to leave at the same time is also a little bit difficult for the rest of us,"" she said. 
&gt; 
&gt; The so-called ""Norway for Now"" option was raised by Conservative MP Nick Boles and would keep the UK in the single market as well as a customs union with the EU. 
&gt; 
&gt; As this could obviate the need for  hard border in Ireland, the proposal has gained cross-party support in Westminster. 
&gt; 
&gt; In return, the UK would be expected to follow EU rules and send payments to Brussels for a fixed period, and then switch to a more sophisticated trade agreement in the future. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Telegraph understands that behind the scenes Norway is deeply skeptical towards Britain becoming an EEA/Efta member. 
&gt; 
&gt; It came as Theresa May insisted that she is not preparing for a general election while addressing EU leaders at a same press conference.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We are not preparing for another general elections. It wouldn't be in the national interest,"" the Prime Minister told reporters at the Nordic summit in Oslo. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Prime Minister had been asked whether her upbeat budget was a signal for an upcoming election. 
&gt; 
&gt; The focus of the summit will be co-operation between Nordic governments, but with Mrs May in attendance Brexit is likely to be near the top of the agenda. 
&gt; 
&gt; It is understood that the Prime Minister held bilateral talks with several Nordic and Baltic states, in the hopes of gaining their support for a compromise over the Brexit deal. 
&gt; 
&gt; Both the UK and EU remain in deadlock over the Irish border, which is the largest obstacle to finalising the Withdrawal Agreement. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Prime Minister says she cannot accept the EU's backstop proposal for avoiding a hard border after Brexit as it would isolate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.
&gt; 
&gt; However, both sides privately hope to form a compromise this week that could open the door to a special Brexit summit in mid-November, where the divorce deal would be officially agreed. 
&gt; 
&gt; In London, Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, suggested today that a Brexit deal could trigger tax cuts and increased public service spending.
&gt; 
&gt; Asked what would happen to Monday's announcements if there was no Brexit deal, Mr Hammond told BBC Breakfast: ""My Budget stands.

I live in Bucharest. Do you know what Bucharest's demographics are? They're 96.6% Romanian (aka Caucasian) and not even all of the remaining 4.4% are non-white.

So what does this mean? It means that your average person can rarely even see a person of another race much less actually interact with one. I realize this is impossible for you to fathom if you live somewhere like Paris, London, Amsterdam etc, but it is true here.

This does not somehow make people innately racist, but they're not used to others, which is EXACTLY how whatever amazing culture you're from was barely a generation or two ago. I don't need to tell you how recent rampant racism was in the West.

Meanwhile cultures you probably think are vastly superior like the US are highly multicultural but racism remains a huge issue. Maybe you're not as great as you think.  

I read your post and you said a whole lot of other bullshit that you rightfully got downvoted for. To put it simply: You are extremely prejudiced, but you probably think it's OK because Slavs are white. Let's run down over some of the things you said and imagine you said Africans are like this instead:

- Being a person of color in a Slav country is extremely dangerous. Slavs are unstable creatures that resort to brutal violence very quickly because of your skin color. You can't even visit without being in great danger! (This is so absurd and hyperbolic I don't even know what to say)
- Slavs were poor and primitive before the great Western countries came and lifted them out of poverty with EU monies (**imagine saying this about Africa holy shit**)
- Traumatic events have shaped the **""collective Slav psyche""**, your words. Christ.
- Talking about crime and criminal empires. Wonder what your opinion would be on people saying the same about other, non-white minorities that are also over-represented in crime. You'd give them the instant racist label, I bet. 

You are VERY prejudiced and the funny thing is you don't even see it. Almost everything you said in that thread is based on memes and stereotypes. I bet you don't actually know any EE people and you've never been to any EE countries. 

You're the one who is obsessed with skin color. You wouldn't dare say even half these things about another race but you feel perfectly comfortable being smug, superior and hateful towards this group because they're white like you. 

Meanwhile there are countries in Africa where basically everything you said could also apply and it's actually MUCH WORSE. There's places like the DRC where groups raid each other, rape and mutilate women, a ton of fucked up stuff and all on the same ethnic divides or sometimes even less. 

But you wouldn't hear a squeak about those from you. Meanwhile a Polish guy that saw a black guy maybe 5 times his whole life looks at him for a little longer and it's the worst ever. SMH indeed.

It really isn't. All state institutions are bound by the laws of the land. Wanting extralegal institutions is akin to suicide.

&gt; People here are saying that while economics should be independent of politics.

This is an impossible proposition. Pretty much all economists will readily admit that their field is related heavily to political science and that it occupies issues that are central to politics. The way resources are managed can't be untangled from politics.

&gt; The value of the money you have in your bank shouldn't depend on the comments your braindead president makes.

When central banks ""protect"" the value of money they use societal resources and state tools to alter market. You are not entitled to money that is of a certain value just how you're not entitled to a guarantee that a stock/bond will maintain its market value, unless you can politically decide to do it. There are no arguments for intervening in the market to stabilize the currency that aren't political in nature.

&gt; Economics is not a judiciary branch. Economics exists in and of itself.

No economist worth their salt will agree with this definition.

A) Central banks are a state institution just like other branches of the state.

Even when you do it, you still have a few ingredients that you need for it and even the simplest form of living where only those ingredients would exist in the world it would still be a consumerism world where people would try gaining as much bread as possible...

922,"At least in Spain, ""this last generation"" has no voice or vote, and the same wil happen with other countries, let me explain.

Baby boomers are the only ones with power here, the country with highest life expectancy in Europe/the World (depending of the source, every study change the parameters and sometimes is first, second, third or fifth).

What im trying to say is that countries with high life expectancy usually have an older population, and an inverse population pyramid going up, where the people over 40 years old rule the country, almost without interference of younger people.

As you can see in the graphic linked below, in Spain, the people between 19 and 39 years old are only 25,3% of the population, while people between 40 and 59 years old are 32.1%, and people between 60 and 99 years old are 25.8%. 

Politically the young generations have the hands tied, the game is rigged, the rethoric was written in the '80 and '90, and we will be stucked there until the people that lives on that rethoric are a minority.

We dont have power, voice or vote, at least speaking in practical terms, we have some political representation, but not enough to force a real change.

At the end of the day, the politics are the same, with a face wash.

953,"&gt;Are you telling me that the shift happened because Germans deeply changed their views on the EU? Or is it because of migration?

No. I am saying this shift is happening because national politics have become sufficiently intertwined with European ones to require parties that have a fully European perspective. Whether that perspective is ""retreat to our nation"" or ""integrate with Europe"" is irrelevant; both are an *answer*, rather than a stunning silence beside some used-up slogans.

The Eurozone and migration crisis were just two topics which are fundamentally European but absolutely dominated our internal political discourse for the past decade. Incidentally, this is the crucible that gave rise to the AfD and hence the Greens as the 'counter-AfD'. Add to this our relationship with Russia, the US and a possible ""European third way"", and you have enough stuff to transform our national political discourse.

&gt;‚ÄúCall it cosmopolitans versus isolationists, liberal-alternative views versus traditional-authoritarian views, Europhiles versus Euroskeptics,‚Äù Ko√ü said.

Was going through many articles about energy and renewable sources and what surprised me is how far this went in last 5 years. The prices of renewable energy fallen massively and investors are looking to put massive amount of money into it. 

Just as always, when the climate is going to cause more damage to big companies, that's when we will see massive effort to save what we can - and we still can. 

My wild guess is that by 2030, we are going to see huge problems around the world caused by ongoing climate changes and that's when the action on massive scale will happen. It will be too late, but just enough to divert from total catastrophic scenario i guess.

1051,"&gt;Can you please stop with the notion that even the idea of independent Montenegro is inherently anti-Serb?

Literally no one argued that the idea of independent Montengro is inherently anti-Serb. Erasure of Serb identity, culture, language and religion from Montenegro's history and implicit discrimination against everyone trying to preserve it because it collides with the national myth of the freshly made Montenegro is inherently anti-Serb. 

&gt;That's patently false, and you know it. The first head of state from the side of the aggressor, to ask for forgiveness for the crimes committed by his countrymen was Milo ƒêukanoviƒá. Was it real? Almost certainly not, but that however is irrelevant. What's relevant is the fact that we have abided, and will continue to abide by those principles. That said, the fact that it's unbelievably hypocritical remains.On the other hand, can Serbia claim the same? What have your politicians done, apart from occasionally parroting the empty words how for example Srebrenica was a terrible crime, carefully picking their words, so as to not admit it was a genocide, because after all, they know better than the Hague Tribunal. A few days pass, and back we go to the openly expressed desires Republika Srpska was independent, for example.

  Expressed forgiveness? Prosecuted war criminals? Actually had a revolution that reformed the system from within? Expanded civic rights for Bosniaks, Croats and other minorities so much that most European countries don't even follow suit? First and foremost acknowledged the crimes instead of trying to erase them by making up a new name and historical narrative? 

  I'm sorry if that stresses you out but Serbs deserve to live and the fact that they are the only ethnicity of ex-Yugoslavia that got locked outside of their country by separatist extremists doesn't make them radical nationalists. Montenegro's territory covers territories where all Montenegro's live + those where Albanians and Serbs live, half the country didn't even want to separate from Serbia. Hate to say it bud but that is far more imperialistic and forced than supporting independence of people in other countries who want to be free from the choke hold of the government they deem oppressive and invalid.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/9sdhxa/serbian_officials_condemn_montenegro_unification/e8pr4lb/,turereka,1540888969

sounded genuine and well written, so i do indeed believe it was indeed a female writer describing her issues than a prank

&gt;Because Eastern Europeans can't stand black people? Jeez. 

not because they cant stand them, but because its getting to ratio, where they cant identify with a single person on screen and so they switch to other channel. this is what progressives claimed for their diversity push, but now when a huge viewer block is antagonized the ratings will crash especially in eastern ratings so those sweet syndication money income will suffer

but its also kinda funny, the new ""diverse"" ""latino"" show mayans m.c., spinoff of sons of anarchy has only 2 latino looking actors, rest of the mayans are mestizo/european, so majority of show looks like you were in Barcelona and not mexican border.

there even was a first mexican reality show with rich mexicans made by netflix actually, and they were all mestizo and indigenous people raged on internet that its not proper representation.

now i have to concede that NCIS NO did introduce the 3rd black character in a reasonable and plausible way, so i do give them credit for it. but its really getting to situation where a certain joke becomes reality: ""if aliens watch human tv, they would think 40% of america are blacks, all white women are married to black men, and all white men are gay"" :P",,/r/europe/comments/9sgq9t/young_adults_in_central_and_eastern_europe/e8pr4us/,Mbrol67,1540888986

Since the first government left of center (1982), there was a fairly successful push from the civil society to be done with these non written rules (as well as the written ones). It became common for movies to make depictions of gay people that we'd find offensively stereotypical: effeminate, a very marked and particular accent, always laughing everything off... But it served its purpose: when people who came from an homophobic background understood what to expect, and saw that they would be frowned upon for behaving that way in public, they started backing off.

Third... what exactly is the difference to using women to get high ranking officials to spill secrets? Why hate on gays and lesbians so much more...? Makes no sense. 

I think it has overall more to do with the fact that all liberal movements were strongly supressed in Warszaw pact countries - which led to fewer people being known as being homosexual and the notion that its very rare and ""unnormal"" got entrenched. In the western countries were you could hold free pride parades for decades or where you had parties for a long time that support minority rights for gays led to the issue being brought more in the centre of society with acceptance growing.

Furthermore, on many issues the US has pretty much a similar diplomatic position as many European states.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The reason that the F-35 was affordable for Belgium was because the US spent $400 Billion to do the research and development on the plane and Belgium gets to piggy back off of that because the US was the one who spent the money on that cost. It's in Belgium's interest to buy the best, most affordable plane, that their money can buy, and they clearly have reasons to think that the F-35 is that plane because it is a 5th generation multi-role stealth aircraft. Belgium, Norway, Denmark, the UK, and the Netherlands clearly have an interest to buy good jets over supporting  vanity. At a certain point, the US did pay to develop these jets.

Hmm.  Surely that only happens if bottom-trawling?  Some places ban that due to damage it causes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_trawling

&gt;Bottom trawling is trawling (towing a trawl, which is a fishing net) along the sea floor. It is also referred to as ""dragging"".

-

&gt; * The Council of the European Union in 2004 applied ""a precautionary approach"" and closed the sensitive Darwin Mounds off Scotland to bottom trawling.
&gt;
&gt;* In 2005, the FAO‚Äôs General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned bottom trawling below 1000 metres and, in January 2006, completely closed ecologically sensitive areas off Italy, Cyprus, and Egypt to all bottom trawling.

&gt;When peace finally arrived in 1945, the world‚Äôs military forces had a major problem on their hands: Scientists did not know how to destroy the massive arsenals of chemical weapons. In the end, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States largely opted for what seemed the safest and cheapest method of disposal at the time: Dumping chemical weapons directly into the ocean.

-

&gt; Popiel explains that the more he read about sulfur mustard after the WLA 206 incident, the more he began to question why it had survived so long on the ocean floor. At room temperature in the lab, sulfur mustard is a thick, syrupy liquid. But under controlled lab conditions, pure sulfur mustard breaks down into slightly less toxic compounds like hydrochloric acid and thiodiglycol. Bomb makers reported that sulfur mustard evaporated from the soil within a day or two during warm summer conditions.
&gt;
&gt;But it seemed to remain strangely stable underwater, even after the metal casing of the bombs corroded. Why? To gather clues, Popiel and a small group of colleagues began testing the WLA 206 sample to identify as many of its chemical constituents as they could. The findings were very revealing. Military scientists had weaponized some stocks of sulfur mustard by adding arsenic oil and other chemicals. The additives made it stickier, more stable, and less likely to freeze on the battlefield. In addition, the team identified more than 50 different ‚Äúdegradation products‚Äù that formed when the chemical weapon agent interacted with seawater, sediments and metal from the bomb casings.
&gt;
&gt;All this led to something that no one had predicted. On the seafloor, sulfur mustard coagulated into lumps and was shielded by a waterproof layer of chemical byproducts. These byproducts ‚Äúform a type of skin,‚Äù says Popiel, and in deep water, where temperatures are low and where there are few strong currents to help break down the degradation products, this membrane can remain intact for decades or longer.

1283,"&gt; Exactly. I also don't understand why is it forbidden to have several legal wives in most of the countries. I explain it by islamophobia.

There is actually very strong research demonstrating that polygamist societies are much less stable and much more violent then monogamous societies. Polygamy virtually always ends up with a small number of males monopolizing large numbers of possible female marriage/mate options, which means huge numbers of men have no possibility of finding a wife, and often no possibility of advancing economically either.

This typically results in those single males turning to violence in order to steal someone else's wife, or acquire enough assets for the huge brideprices that are typical of polygamous societies.

A research paper that I came across last spring was written by Nigerian authors and showed that polygamy contributed to the rise of Boko Haram in Northern Nigeria. Nigerian men who were too poor to pay a brideprice joined Boko Haram on promises of being able to take cattle from villages Boko Haram attacked, cattle being one of the main assets used to pay for a wife.

The reason this isn't a problem in, say, Singapore, which has far higher levels of population density than Niger, is because it has an educated population and economy that doesn't do small-scale farming.

If Singapore has more people, yeah, it can create new expenses, but it's got a service-based economy that scales well with population.

The law says you have to have winter tires in certain conditions (ice, snow, aso). It's up to the motorist if those conditions aren't met but in case you get in an accident in winter and didn't have the tires you'll likely get into trouble with your insurance as well.

That statement doesn't make any sense - the US is dependent upon domestic consumption for like 75% of its economy, it has massively abundant natural resources, it can grow enough food to support itself, it has no rivals in it's entire hemishpere.  The US is literally the country that is most well positioned to survive isolation.

&gt;No sane Security advisor or economic advisor or IRE advisor would ever recommend USA to step down from it¬¥s position in international relation system. That would be akin to suicide.

Suicide for who? It would be far worse for the nations that rely on the US to enforce international law and accepted convention.  For example no US Navy = free for all on the open seas and there is no one to enforce international maritime law to the same extent, so any nation that relies on global trade would be severely impacted.

Emphasis on 'claimed'. There are more women on the internet who talk in MRA groups about how they hate getting jobs because they are female than there are women on this planet. Nobody would ever lie on reddit to push their agenda.

* Humans need, for drinking alone (like, to avoid a no-water-in-the-city shit hits the fan scenario) about half a gallon a day.  That plant could handle a hundred million people with drinking water.  That's twice South Africa's entire population.

* In practice, they aren't going to wait until all other sources are exhausted.  You'd project and run as supplemental water, just like we do in California.

* South Africans use about 62 gallons/capita of water at normal household levels (which is actually surprisingly similar to US levels, at ~89 gallons/day).  That should get that plant alone capable of getting pretty close to handling regular use of that city without other sources (though in practice, if it were in use and the only source, prices would rise and I'd expect consumption to drop).

1515,"&gt; When it's blatant tokenism and pandering, it does

I mean I don't disagree with that, and many gay people don't either. 

&gt; There are some great characters who happen to be gay, unfortunately, there are dozens of non-characters with a hard to miss ""gay"" label for each of them.

This is gonna be a point of contention, because, in your mind, ""who happen to be gay"" means they should be in closet and the fact that they're gay should never or very very rarely be disclosed and it shouldn't be relevant to their character, and that's not inclusive or supportive of gay rights. You can have a great character a great story of a gay man falling in love with another man and them becoming a couple and marrying and have it not be tokenism or pandering but you'd say it is because he isn't hiding he's gay. 

&gt; This is the end goal

I don't think so, that works in the US because of the specific makeup of modern America and all their many neurosis and issues over Civil Rights and race and minority rights and their specific, extremely loud and demanding dare I say entitled, political culture. Europe is different, even progressive Europeans believe stuff like you need to speak the dominant language and assimilate to dominant culture to be fully of that country, which would be considered borderline far right in the US.

1571,"&gt;Which is why I said Hong Kong doesn't fit the Irish question. 

That wasn't my argument, you implied there were parallels between Hong Kong being occupied and Northern Ireland, when there isn't. The Irish government recognises as fact the territory of the north being an integral part of the UK, abandoning its claim over the area through a constitutional amendment, whereas the Chinese never did with Hong Kong.

&gt;Where Hong Kong is relevant is in the UK's attitude towards conceding territory during the period during The Troubles and after the Falklands War. There were grounds to dispute the handover of HK (the agreement was with the Qing Dynasty, not the PRC) but it was felt to be more trouble than keeping hold of HK was worth. Likewise, the IRA were proving to be more trouble than Northern Ireland was worth.

That attitude could be said of maintaining Gibraltar or the Falklands, the reason we keep them is due to large segments of their population wanting to remain part of the UK. Economics isn't always the main precursor to defending territory.

&gt;I know about the Irish constitution, but the GFA is a more relevant document re: the north. Under the terms of the GFA, both UK and Ireland agreed the Northern Irish people's right to self determination is sovereign and that Northern Ireland can join the Republic if ever there is a majority to support that. It's possible that both sides knew that really meant: Northern Ireland will be handed over to Ireland when it will be peaceful to do so. Here we are 20 years on, and the polls are pretty much 50/50 support for a united Ireland

Yeah, so if this is a roundabout way of agreeing with my point that people in NI can have an Irish passport if they so wished, which you proposed as if it could be a new policy, then yes, this is correct.

So we're in agreement, Hong Kong was an occupied lease territory from another state, where NI was not military occupied, as it is an integral part of the UK with a majority of its population holding the same view, with a significant portion of its population also holding an affinity with another territory which used to be part of the UK, of which we've come to an agreement with.

1576,"&gt; So? Of course you choose the ""best"" country for immigration. Would you immigrate to a poor african country or to the US if you had a choice? Still does not mean that a majority of the people does not want to work and/or immigrate. Of course there are some people that do not want to work and abuse the welfare system (we do have some of them in germany too).

Our asylum system shouldn't be abused for migration. This is a kick in the butt for every legal migrant, that went through the long process of getting into Germany the normal way (US citizens for example).

&gt;Again, what is your solution? We do have huge problems in 10-20 years.

As I said earlier, there is enough money for pensions, if we also use tax money for it.

&gt;Sure, they could go back and die in their country because of war/racism/

War in Syria is almost over, already lots of safe regions. Shouldn't be more unsafe than Israel if you ask me. And who exactly is fleeing because of racism these days?

&gt;Some years ago the asylum decision took a long time (not sure if thats still the case) and you are were not allowed to work in between.

Its not the case anymore.

&gt;Sometimes i wish some of the people that are against immigration that much would be in the role of the immigrants

I'm sure I wouldn't harass, attack, sexually abuse or kill citizens of my host nation.

As I said earlier though, I am not against all kinds of migration.

3.

No no usta.

1. A small country, even a dysfunctional one, won't invade a country half way around the world.

2. It also is less likely to invade or otherwise ruin a neighbouring country to the detriment of its own citizens (eg Ankara : Syria, Washington DC : Mexico).

Do you speak German?

&gt;2015 hat die gro√üe Zahl von Fl√ºchtlingen aus dem Nahen und Mittleren Osten sowie aus Afrika die politische Agenda bestimmt. Vor allem der B√ºrgerkrieg in Syrien und der Terror der radikal-islamistischen Miliz ISIS haben Hunderttausende von Menschen in die Flucht in Richtung Europa getrieben. Die Fl√ºchtlingskrise kann nur gesamteurop√§isch gel√∂st werden. Daher arbeitet Deutschland eng mit seinen europ√§ischen Partnern zusammen.
&gt;
&gt;Der Bund entlastet die L√§nder und Kommunen bei der Betreuung, Unterbringung und Versorgung der Fl√ºchtlinge. **Die Asylverfahren werden beschleunigt, Fehlanreize beseitigt. Menschen ohne Bleibeperspektive sollen schneller in ihre Heimatl√§nder zur√ºckgef√ºhrt werden.**

https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/jahresberichte-der-bundesregierung/jahresbericht-der-bundesregierung-2014-2015/468286-468286

You will find that if you read the actual statements of the German government on the topic that they always include the intention to speed up deportations and similar things. These were just not reported on in international media.

The bold paragraph reads (paraphrasing) asylum procedures will be sped up, false incentives will be removed and people that do not qualify will be deported more swiftly.  

 Germany even financed information campaigns in the middle east and Africa (like television spots, radio spots and such) to tell people that the things told about Germany are lies and that they shouldn't come. 

&gt; and she did not rapidly deport them.

Merkel absolutely made laws to speed up deportations. Several ten-thousand per year are deported or are sent home via voluntary return programs. For some countries the change in these laws basically stopped new arrivals(mostly from the West-Balkan). 

&gt;It was her job to find a way and if a law needed changing or she needed to exit or renegotiate a treaty then do it. If it meant changing the constitution then do it. 

Germany is not a dictatorship Merkel is a member of a centre-right party in a coalition with a centre-left party so her party alone has not even the votes to pass a simple law. Essentially no German party could ever just pass laws, they are always coalitions. To change the constitution she would have needed votes from several opposition parties on top of that.

&gt; In the US we are about as hardcore about following our constitution as any nation I know and we have a process for amending it. If she is unsure of how to do that then have her ask Trump for advice. 

It is not a secret how the constitution is changed. 2/3 majority in the Federal Diet 2/3 majority in the Federal Council. The President has to sign (and the court could rule that it is not compatible with paragraph 1 or 20 of the constitution which are protected by the eternity clause). Her conservative parties combined with her social-democratic coalition partner would need the votes of the Greens and either the Liberals or the Socialist. The President is also to the left of her. 

&gt;The bottom line is at a minimum she should not be trying to push them off on other nations that clearly do not want them. 

Merkel never proposed pushing migrants that were in Germany to other countries. She asked countries to take migrants from Italy and Greece to help those countries.

&gt;Germany is luring them in with generous benefits 

Are you aware that most countries in Europe have comparable benefits to Germany? And again, if they were lured by benefits why didn't they come in 2005. Germany had benefits at that time, too.

&gt;and that is nobody's fault outside of Germany.

No, Germany did not lure people in, did not invite people to Germany and was not responsible for the huge increase of migrants in 2015. ",Berlin (Germany),/r/europe/comments/9sbkvy/angela_merkel_has_told_her_cdu_party_she_will_not/e8oop3s/,MartinS82,1540845891

As a strong Remainer in the UK - I ... semi agree in that it was a mistake to let so many in without much warning, but only politically.

Morally, it was the right thing to do (imo) but it gave a *lot* of ammunition to use against her.  I think politically it was a bad move and one that's dented her popularity at home.  Which is a shame because she *is* - as far as I can see - a good *leader*.  She's not superwoman and she's not always right.  But she's smart, she *listens* and she looks at the stats and facts and figures.  

That's a heck of a lot more than *most* politicians would do.


She is strong willed.  She will try to get what she wants.  She's not always brilliant at small talk (I hear she's quite shy and dislikes meeting strangers - something I share with her :D ).

She seems very willing to compromise and to be diplomatic - she leads / led a coalition which included some fairly religious people which isn't easy to balance these days.

She's done it for what, 13, 14 years almost?

Interesting. 

1) So had the UK had dropped bombs from Tornados on the bogside against IRA targets, and killed 30 civilians in the process, that would have been fair enough, in your humble opinion?

2) Do you have any evidence that the vast majority of killings by the British Army were *not* the result of ""crossfire""? 

3) What about when they carried out massacres, bombed pubs full of people, or tarred and feathered/kneecapped people in their own neighbourhoods in kangaroo courts? What does that have to do with bombing critical infrastructure in an act of war, as you are clearly trying to categorise all IRA murders.

1800,"&gt;How do you get out of that ghetto when the prices are much more expensive outside?  
&gt;  
&gt;No, it's not just a one-way responsibility for them to mix with the rest of the country. It goes both ways. Especially when they are the poorest, and the government has the power to make a change by giving incentives for people or other social classes to live there, or lower housing princes.  
&gt;  
&gt;But those same people put pressure on their mayors to keep the segregation. They dug their own grave in the long run and today the consequences are here : decades that people don't want to mix, and now they're surprised even the new generations didn't just miraculously adopt a 100% western lifestyle.

Sure dude, you go live in the ghetto. It's so nice there, a few government incentives will do the trick.

And this is once again painting people as innocent bystanders in their own lives. As if they are not responsible for their choices to do those things.

&gt;Racial insults, and inciting hate is, in most european countries.

How is insulting a historical figure a racial insult? And since when did Muslims become a race? Should we fine people for making remarks about child abuse in the Catholic Church?

&gt;Why not? Do I look like a pro-extremist to you?  
&gt;  
&gt;Now maybe replacing the extremist preachers would be a more appropriate first-step in those cases. But that's more of a detail.

You seem to go out of your way to make up excuses for people who become extremists. So it is good to see that you at least agree on this.

&gt;Today that's how it is.  
&gt;  
&gt;But at the very start of this chain reaction, many decades ago, it is right wing extremists that started it all.  
&gt;  
&gt;As I said, at the start, immigrants came for jobs, they didn't come as an organised invasion force to create violence and crime. Right wing parties were the first to spread the narrative that they were a nuisance, created unemployment, and were culturally different. That is when the feeling of rejection and hate started to build into conflict.

The immigrant is the innocent bystander once again, falling victim to the right wing that is the cause of all evil... I don't buy it, it's a simplification and ignoring everything about how we got to this point. And you are doing exactly the same thing you blame others for.

1898,"Sorry but that's strait up bullshit. Logic that works for physical items does not work for online media.

Several studies have been done on the situation in Spain and every single one found that consumption of online news declined 6-15% after the implementation of the link tax as well as revenue for the news makers.

They also found that the chief losers in all of this were not Google or Facebook nor the big Spanish news outlets but smaller local news outlets and smaller local aggregators many of whom simply shut down. This is plain and simple a dumb idea conceived  by people who have no idea how online media works. 

In online media the more something is shared(""Ripped off""), the more traction it gets, the more clicks it get etc. etc. Someone making a gif of your youtube video and uploading to r/gifs for example is a net potitive for your channel. If you are an online media company you want to be ""ripped off"" as much and as often as possible.

Further even if it was not a horrible idea on the face of it, the implementation is total garbage. The way it is written means that each individual EU member will have different rules for what does and does not constitute a taxable link. So that means if you want to aggregate news in Europe you will need to somehow determine for each country whether or not you need to pay the tax.

The Googles and Facebooks of the world might well have the resources to do that or design a system to that for them but but the smaller local sites, startups etc. certainly will not. So even if Google and co. decide to stick around and pay the tax it will very likely make them even more ubiquitous and give them even more leverage to strong arm websites.

This thing is just dumb from top to bottom, its a bad idea on the face, it is badly implemented and will be negative for everyone from end users, to aggregators to the news makers.

1946,"&gt;First it needs to hit those limits. Secondly everyone just assumes they won't grow like india or China which have WAAAAY more people per km2 than even europe let alone US or Africa which has the least amount people per km2.

We know that china has very high human capital and Indian has medium human capital and a large cognitive elite from international assessment tests. That is not the case with Africa, so the potential for growth is lower unless these problems are (and can be) addressed.

&gt;""My point is that sometimes this is necessary."" your words.

I never proposed genocide. I proposed reducing fertility so that there is no unsustainable growth.

&gt; I say it is nessesary that French people should be removed from Earth. That would help earth of something.

That is both stupid and wrong while my suggestion likely would help a lot of people.

&gt;Problem is that theory didn't work for both China and India. Especially for India which has like the most people per km2.

These cases are very different. For one India even at the peak grew more slowly and always had higher human capital. 

&gt;No it is not bullshit. Nations grow out of share number of people in them. The more people in nation the faster progress is made, the more people go to school, the more people create companies, sell things and so on.

That is why Sweden is much poorer and lesss innovative than Bagladesh. Wait, that cannot e right? Density and population and wealth help, but human capital dominates world wide comparison of such.

&gt;Yes africa is poor. But last thing it needs is stopping population growth. It needs more people to make more progress.

Africa is nearly an absoliute zero when it comes to relevant innovation, most applicable innovation would come from outside, be it with 2 of with 5 billion Africans. Human capital has to come first, else this theory of yours does not work.

2105,"&gt;  There is always a better solution then war.

Is there though? In a perfect world, sure. But we don't live in one. Is there really _always_ a better solution than war?

Should Hitler have been allowed to just annex and occupy left and right? It's not war if no one shoots back, right? And no need to keep concentration camps secret if no one can do anything about it.

I like to compare militaries to police. In a perfect world there would be no crime. Certainly there is much we could do to prevent crime before it happens. And we _should_ do a lot more. But can we ever _really_ get rid of it? Probably not. We will always need the police, and the police will always need to sometimes resort to force, just like nations will sometimes need to resort to force.

Saying there is always a better solution than war is like saying that there is always a better solution than the police tasing someone. Sounds good in practice, but does not work so well when you have some guy high on drugs trying to rip someone's face off.

2147,"&gt; Greens and SPD aren't really social parties anymore

I disagree, Greens and SPD are still social parties, they do not differ much from the CDU anymore though (which is way more social/left because of Merkel than 10-20 years ago). Compared to the old CDU/CSU they are social parties. In addition the SPD is still doing good, social politics but they are shadowed by internal/govermental fights.

&gt; As sad as it is, Germany produces about 2% of worldwide CO2 emissions, even if we stopped all of it, there would still be climate change.
&gt; And its no solution to hamper small car owners, while airplanes and ships are still pumping out toxic waste everyday.

Thats like saying ""other people are bad and because of that i shouldn't set an example and be bad as well"". Sure, we won't ""solve"" climate change alone but we can set an positive example and prepare for the future. At some point in the future we HAVE to care about it - and well, why not be better prepared than others? Even from an economic point of view it makes sense to be prepared for what the future wants and needs, even though it costs money now. As an example BWM and VW could have dominated the electric cars, but well, they decided not to invest (much) and now we have Tesla, Renault, ... and german cars are way behind. Same with renewable energy, everybody complained in the beginning and now we are at a good and efficient point.

&gt; There might be a reason why many poor people don't vote left anymore, imo because they got nothing from it in the past.

If you look at the US then you realize that social democracy and all the left parties got us a lot in the last 100 years.

Because science started to give much better and more accurate answers (darwin, newton, keppler, pasteur... is it a coincidence their discoveries happened approximately at the same time religion started to lose pace?).

What has this to do with anything today? I can see the reasons. I can't see the relevance. And once again you push these people into a group that somehow does not understand science then and can't help it to be more extreme in their religion.

&gt;The point is : empires and cultures are not superior or inferior to eachother. Circumstances allow them either to get ahead of, or get behind. Just like those empires where ahead of europe at a time, then fell back.

Still not relevant for why Muslims (in Europe even) feel attacked over criticism on their religion.

2230,"""Craftsmen"" were a tiny, extremely privileged minority, raking in excess profits from being protected by monopoly decrees through the guild system. Industry workers were almost exclusively former farmers, peasants, etc. who poured into the cities because factory work paid substantially more. So yours is an odd comparison.

Austria hardly became irrelevant **at all** during that time. Quite the opposite. They didn't industrialize forever, but once they did, they grew rapidly. The Empire built up the fourth-largest machine building industry of the world, after the United States, Germany, and the UK. Austria-Hungary was also the world's third largest manufacturer and exporter of electric home appliances, electric industrial appliances and facilities for power plants, after the United States and the German Empire.

Vienna and Budapest grew like crazy, the former becoming the cultural and intellectual capital of Europe, in many ways.

Meanwhile, the colonies proved to be a huge burden for all the colonial nations. They all bled money like crazy to keep up administrations for little gain. Austria *did* have the Ostend company, but they dissolved it. The colony business made no profits.

Had A-H not industrialized a hundred years after the German North, the Habsburgs would more than likely rule Great Germany. But even outside of that, A-H would have been the most powerful nation in Europe, had they not also refused to modernize the military. Prussian-led Germany was the strongest single power, despite a smaller poulation. Are you going to tell me that was because of their Namibia holdings?! It obviously wasn't.

You simply don't want to admit your mistake. No problem

&gt;Still not relevant for why Muslims (in Europe even) feel attacked over criticism on their religion.

The arguments takes many steps because it's not that simple. You just try to erase all the steps in the middle to make it look like there is no link between the two.

&gt;Would you apply the same excuses to them then? That those groups and political parties can't help it, but are just responses to the hatred they see towards themselves from the Muslim community? And we should just wait until they catch up then without criticizing them.

2312,"&gt;TIRANA, Albania ‚Äî Police in Albania fatally shot a man in a gunbattle with officers Sunday during an annual event to celebrate Greece's entry in World War II against Italy, prompting a strong reaction from Athens.

&gt;Konstantinos Kacifa, a 35-year-old dual Albanian-Greek citizen, first started shooting in the air in the village of Bularat, 255 kilometers (160 miles) south of the capital, Tirana, police said in a statement. Then the man fired at approaching police cars before running away.

&gt;Kacifa hid on a nearby mountain and continued to fire at officers, authorities said. Police said he died in the exchange of fire.

&gt;Kacifa was born in Bularat but had most recently been living in Athens. Police and prosecutors were investigating a motive for the man's actions.

&gt;Greece's Foreign Ministry reacted to his death by saying ""it is unacceptable that the operation resulted in the loss of a human life.""

&gt;""We await from Albanian authorities the complete clarification of the conditions under which the aforementioned Greek citizen lost his life and will immediately make the necessary moves,"" a statement said.

On his facebook you can see that he was clearly involved in extremist circles, and some sources are stating he was associated with Golden Dawn. Obviously he is not indicative of average Greeks.

A similar thing also happened in East Germany.

While the kind of people who stayed behind in East Germany were the least likely to be political dissidents.

I think Scandinavian emigration to the US is more of an extreme example. People forget how dirt poor Scandinavia used to be only 100 years ago. They had by far the largest percentage of their country emigrate. Second only to maybe Ireland during the 1840s famine.

2476,"Because if the only criterion is being bigger, then there is no particular reason why Stockholm should be considered more important than London or Berlin, or indeed even Copenhagen.

My point is that size is not what makes a capital.

Even if it was, Stockholm and Copenhagen are very similar in size. As others have pointed out, Stockholm has a larger formal population, but Copenhagen consists of a dense city core with a large number of surrounding municipalities. It is very easy to make the argument that the metropolitan area of Copenhagen (2.4 million in 2005) is more populous than the metropolitan area of Stockholm (2.2 million in 2005), but it all comes down to how you want to slice the cake. 

The Copenhagen metropolitan area is so populous because Denmark is very ""monopolar"", i.e. about 40% of Denmark's population lives in the Copenhagen metropolitan area.

Stockholm is unquestionably more financially important than Copenhagen, but not by a large margin. Politically, Stockholm is irrelevant outside of Sweden (or similar in relevance to any other foreign capital). Culturally, everything gets a lot more murky.

However, I have to return to my original point: It is *incredibly* offensive to call oneself the ""capital"" of something else, without consent.

This, then, means that the first year or two in college has to be spent teaching a lot of prerequisites, and the students can finally start really learning their major content during years 3 and 4. Then, they go directly to PhD after only about two years of hardcore major classes. Same story repeats: The first year of their PhD is spent learning material that many EU countries teach as a part of their undergraduate.

""Towards the end of World War II, food supplies became increasingly scarce in the Netherlands. After the landing of the Allied Forces on D-Day, conditions grew increasingly bad in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands. The Allies were able to liberate the southern part of the country, but their liberation efforts came to an abrupt halt when Operation Market Garden, their attempt to gain control of the bridge across the Rhine at Arnhem, failed. The seizure of the approaches to the port of Antwerp (the Battle of the Scheldt) was delayed due to Montgomery's preoccupation with Market Garden.

After the national railways complied with the exiled Dutch government's appeal for a railway strike starting September 1944 to further the Allied liberation efforts, the German administration (under Wehrmachtbefehlshaber Friedrich Christiansen) retaliated by placing an embargo on all food transports to the western Netherlands.

By the time the embargo was partially lifted in early November 1944, allowing restricted food transports over water, the unusually early and harsh winter had already set in. The canals froze over and became impassable for barges.""

Poland is one country, where the jews lead not just in quality, but also quantity.

Quality in general is the point. Jews were not the only ones who died, but they were killed in factories of death. They were not just starved and worked to death. The Nazis had to design new ovens, because they could not get rid of so many bodys. There was research and development to increase the amount of jews, which could be killed. Even ABC weapons are intended to be used in a way that has a military benefit.

The holocaust just is the pinnacle of human inflicted horror.

Of course there were more people, who died, but we as a species tend to pic the max and go with it. For me, as a lesson for the future the holocaust is not as important in its gory details, as it his how it got to a point where they had to advance tech to kill more.

2713,"You don't have any veto rights either way. Some politician you probably didn't even vote for does.

Regardless of that, sure, you can evaluate whether it's still worth it, but that doesn't change that with 28 member states you can't have veto rights. Currently a system of double majority is used, which works quite well, everyone seems to agree. Not every decision will suit everyone, but most decisions will suit any given nation and the fact that the EU can make decisions and react to new situations benefits everyone.

The Lisbon treaty also introduced Article 40, which should be familiar from Brexit articles. A process for leaving did not exist prior to the Lisbon treaty. 

Why is this relevant? Well, everyone decided the Union should expand, otherwise that wouldn't have happened. Everyone also agreed the EU had to reform in order for that to happen. If any given country found its no longer worth it, they can always just leave. It is entirely within their rights.

Furthermore the Lisbon treaty was passed democratically. Way more so than any previous treaty. Most treaties, not just EU, but any international treaties, are not decided by referendum. Ever. 

The Treaty on the Constitution was rejected by referendum.

The Treaty of Lisbon was rejected by referendum.

The changed Treaty of Lisbon, more satisfactory, was passed in referendum.

The second referendum was not on the same text. They legitimately conceded to the electorate what they wanted, and the electorate decided the new deal was good.

What is unfair and undemocratic is that Ireland could hold up the process by rejecting it and gain concessions no one else did. Democracy doesn't require unanimity, and when a given process does, its going to be dominated by the one selfish stubborn prick who doesn't care what anyone else wants, essentially becoming a tyrant. I'm sure you've known some annoying uncompromising person you were forced to compromise with in your life at some point and understand why this is a problem.

There are however a few inconsistencies:

The treaty was between states, why was there a referendum? Most states didn't have one. If every state accepts, isn't that an agreement between sovereign states with elected governments and thus democratic?

If it should be decided by citizens, not states, shouldn't no state have a say at all. Shouldn't it just be a referendum?

Furthermore of one is to have a referendum, having state referenda is a rigged system. You would have 28 different referenda, with each of them having to succeed. One failing can overturn the will of 27. (Maybe leave of you don't agree, let the rest of us continue doing our thing?) Furthermore it's not really the will of 28 either way, because it simplifies each state to a yes or no, thus not representing nearly half of Europeans. If it indeed fails due to a few states, it fails to represent the vast majority of Europeans and is thus undemocratic. To illustrate how rigged this is, imagine if all it required to pass was 51% in favour in one member state, even if everyone else rejected it. This is entirely equivalent.

Therefore, the only legitimate referendum on European issues, is a European referendum. A single referendum across all member states, counting the votes of citizens.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9s383u/juncker_on_the_topic_of_the_clock_changes_survey/e8mnz1w/,GalaXion24,1540766149

2756,"But Caucasus was part of the original Europe. Some people completely dismiss the idea without actually knowing the history. Originally Europe consisted of what is now Eastern Europe with the center being Greece and the area including Balkans, Caucasus, Ukraine. With western parts like Iberia being a lot further from the center of Europe than Asia minor. That was changed By Romans who considered themselves as the center and their surroundings being Europe. hence the border shifted from Caucasus to River Don. So it was always defined by the bigger power who considered itself ""the center"".. All in all If we consider Greece to be the founders of Europe then Caucasus is part of Europe. If we consider Rome as founders then it isn't.

2758,"&gt;Without the SVP, Switzerland would be ruled by people like Merkel

God, this bullshit narrative again.

&gt;You could enjoy ""refugees"" and insane energy policies and a slowly but surely starting media induced hatred for you own country.

You do realise we take in refugees? You do realise we have a big renewable energy industry, despite the SVP, not because of them. If anything we should be pushing that further, as renewable energy is the only way we can become more energy independent. Furthermore, the main source of hate in Switzerland is the SVP. They are the ones causing a divide in our country with their demagoguery and populism, not the other parties. 

&gt;It is a mistake to believe that Switzerland became rich and successfull just like that. The biggest party of course had a big part in it. 

When Switzerland saw its big growth after the war, the SVP didn't exist in its current form. Originally they were a centrist party for farmers, and only began to move to the right and then right-wing with the arrival of Blocher. All that the ""modern"" SVP did, was cause a decline, stagnation in the 90s, which took until 1998 to reach pre-decline levels, and make our international standing worse by attacking bilateral treaties with lies and half-truths. 

&gt;Germany was once almost as rich as switzerland(when it was still conservative),

The last time Germany had similar GNP and GDP PPP to Switzerland was in 1938.... Is that the ""conservativeness"" you're looking for? Or the Prussian militarism from the decades before?

2769,"&gt; What does the word 'Czech' itself actually mean and where did it come from?

It is derived from word for ""kinsman"" and is cognate with word for ""human"".

&gt; What or how do Czechs refer to themselves in your native Czech language

ƒåech (masculine singular), ƒåe≈°ka (feminine singular), ƒåe≈°i (masculine and general plural), ƒåe≈°ky (feminine plural).

&gt; What's it like living in an entire country yet with such a small, tiny population?

It has over ten million people in relatively small territory. It's hardly tiny.

&gt; Czechia is of the few landlocked countries in Europe, so what's it like living in a country with no coast and access to the sea?

It might be somewhat annoying but in this era pretty irrelevant.

&gt; Do Czech people consider Slovaks and other Slavs to be family, to be brothers &amp; sisters?

Slovak mostly yes, in many cases they are literally our kin as result interbreeding. Other Slavs less so, especially those with orthodox background.

&gt; Also what's the relationship like today between Czechia and the former constituate countries that made up the Austro-Hungarian Empire?

Fine.

&gt; What kind of legacy and and effect has the Austro-Hungarian Empire left on modern Czechia today?

Austria-Hungary has mostly negative reputation but its influence is still quite apparent.

&gt; Also What kind of legacy and and effect has communism and the Soviet Union left on modern Czechia today?

According to majority of population negative.

&gt; but as an Czech have you ever tried and do you like cider and ale? Do you like it or not?.. And can you buy cider and ale in Czechia?.

Yes.

&gt; What does takeaway/takeout food in Czechia consist of, what's it like?

Most common ones are East Asian (for example noodles), Middle Eastern (for example kebab), Italian (for example pizza) and local (for example fried cheese).

&gt; Well as a Czech what do you think about it?

Nothing really. How things sound to you is your problem.

&gt; Compared to its fellow Slav neighbors just why is Czechia so athiest and non-religious?

Most Czech weren't Catholic before Habsburg recatholisation. Then during National revival religion didn't become part of national identity.

&gt; Would a non-white person be safe &amp; be welcome visiting Czechia??... Would their life be in danger?, would they be at risk of being attacked/beaten up?

Czech Republic is very safe in general.

&gt; In Czechia are Brits considered to be attractive/hot/sexy?

No.

&gt; Are most Czechs pro or anti British?

I would say indifferent.

&gt; Do you learn about the Celts, Romans, Saxons, British Empire, Industrial Revolution, The Middle Ages etc?

Yes.

&gt; and are basics beyond trading and wars covered, or do go more in-depth or is it just those two main topics?

Some things besides wars and trade are covered in more depth.

&gt; Just what do you learn about the UK?

Location, basics of history, geography, political system and culture.

&gt; When it comes to things like sex and porn are you prudish, awkward and puritanical, is it a big taboo to openly discuss such matters, like do Czech ppl like to pretend it doesnt exist?

Generally no.

&gt; Is Feminism a thing in Czechia?, And if feminism is a thing is it out of control like in other parts of Europe?

Yes. No.

&gt; Are most Czech men uncut or not?

Former.

&gt; What is the LGBT situation like in Czechia?

Fine.

&gt; do they have rights?

Yes.

&gt; Is LGBT and being gay accepted socially and cultrally?

It is by majority.

&gt; Is Pan-Slavism a big deal/serious thing in Czechia?

No.

&gt; What are race relations like in Czechia?

There aren't that many people of other races. Only significant minority of different race are Vietnamese who are mostly accepted.

&gt; What's your opinion on the EU's eastward expansion and accepting in of Czechia/The Slavic nations?

I am fine with it.

&gt; Do you think Eastern Europe was allowed into the EU too eay or not and why?

There isn't single Eastern European country in EU.

&gt; Do you feel safe in Czechia?. Is Czechia in 2018 a safe country?.

Yes.

&gt; How would you describe Czech food?

Heavy.

&gt; What do you like about it and what do you dislike about it?

It's tasty but unhealthy.

&gt; How common is mixed/interracial dating in Czechia?, and how common is it to see mixed/interracial couples in Czechia?

Uncommon.

2797,"I don't see it as particularly different to not wanting a childless leader. I don't fully buy into the argument but some people want iconic leaders that capture images of national virility and childbirth - homosexuality is the polar opposite of that, it makes 0 babies. Especially at a time when European birthrates have collapsed.

Europe is awash with childless leaders: Merkel, Macron, May, Rutte, L√∂fven, Varadkar - even my own Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon. Some through biological incapability but others by choice.

I think that childbirth has a non-trivial psychological impact on people that makes them more conservative, risk averse and increases their sensitivity to external threats. I think that the detached managerial nature of the modern European elite who care near exclusively about economics and never culture or nation is entirely tied into the fact that so few of them have genetic skin in the game.

Maybe I'm placing undue emphasis on this but I don't think I'm stupid or bigoted for pointing this out. Homosexuality is the antithesis of childbirth. Edit: I'd certainly have a softer view if adoption were discussed or in cases such as Ruth Davidson (lesbian Scottish Tory leader) who had a child, although the means by which and father are unknown.

I already have a degree in Economics from a university with a difficulty far greater than any European university (Taking into account it's also 4 years instead of 3) and I just found during my last year that my *thing* was everything related to computers (Wasn't going to ditch all the progress and start another degree) and started learning everything on my own. Programming, discrete math, OOP, networks, etc etc.

I have been reading and doing stuff (discrete math mostly) like non-stop for the past year and half. But I don't know if by providing evidence of the stuff I did will suffice for an European university.

Guess I will have steal and try to argue that my Econ. fits into a data science or computational logic degree.

EDIT: Adding a little pseudo rant. I mean, if I study on my own for two years, two years and a half non-stop, logic and discrete math I would be FAR more able to be in the computational logic MSc at the TU Dresden than any other person who was doing a BSc in IT Eng.

2868,"&gt;So i downvoted you and i have a squadron, lmao ? I downvoted you because you're plain and simply a liar.

Bla bla bla, more pseudo moral highground. You have no proof im a liar.

&gt;An example you completely missed the point with, still waiting for a source on how he was killed by Vucic/Serbian government.

I literally linked it in the same comment you pretend you read.

&gt;Yep, also a lot of stonings,stabbings and shootings of Serbs by Albanians, isn't quite weird when Kosovo is in a limbo.

""Local Crime"" is Local Crime. If 2 drug dealers decide to knife each other have at it. Fact is that what I quoted was a serb from Kosovo. You are a teen from Belgrade talking about what you THINK serbs from Kosovo live like.

&gt;I talked to the admins about it

I kmeed to the admins about it*
&gt;I talked to the admins about it, no need to take it up with you, who can't even source half the stuff he says.

AKA. I can't prove shit and I won't back up my claims but I will spam source even if you type Water is Wet. 

&gt;You failed miserably then, didn't you?

Were not the ones that went from a European superpower to top 10 poorest countries in Europe.

&gt;Im not surprised at your reading skills, but Belgrade on Water(its Belgrade Waterfront btw) is a housing/business complex, not a resort..

In English its Belgrade on Water. Makes little difference if its a complex or not. You choose not to wash your pretty buttocks in its fountains but instead in Greece.

&gt;Indeed it is, but its a sad state of affairs when another country has to come clean up your trash because it's endangering it, and it doesnt even border you, which is quite frankly hilarious.

Not really. USA helps Israel with their problems. France helps Morocco with theirs. Austria helps us with our borders etc. It is not so unheard of for other more powerful nations to ""help"" smaller ones for their benefit.  

&gt;Better than Turkey i guess.

Turkey is one of your biggest trading partners WTF are you smoking lol?

&gt;yeah, just like that time you cried in my PMs then pasted the convo on r/albania, 

Proof?  Source? Link?

&gt;That dude replied to me the dude on the_donald didn't reply to you, you literally searched for a thread and commented on it, pathethic.

I don't speak serbian genius. I think you are deliberately leaving this part out. I already told you people in r/serbia don't like you and chat with me. Your ass better not try to sneak its way into our little discord like you did with r/bih

&gt;So that's another albanian that's triggered enough to rumble through 3-4 month old threads, seems to be a trend with you guys, but i can't complain, it does provide comedy. At least you didn't forget to downvote me and upvote him, so much for a squadron lol.

Proof I did that? Why did you leave the rest of the comment out :) Might it be because you have talked about me several times on r/serbia calling me siptara?

&gt;But i do understand, less developed states have always been obsessed with the better ones, it sucks but it's the truth.

2869,"It's not Anglo-Saxon bullshit, it's that the entire point of publishing research is to enable the largest possible audience to find it and thus allow it to make a positive contribution to the world. When you're publishing in other languages, be it Russian or Swahili, this is made a lot more difficult. Encouraging English publications results in greater mixing of ideas which gives stronger research. You will find it very difficult to find a successful academic that is not reasonably fluent in English because it will straight up prevent them from doing their work as well as it could be done. It will almost certainly result in unnecessary repetition of research, another reason to encourage universal use of English in research.

The system doesn't discourage other cultures or thinking in other languages, pretty much the opposite, you can think in both English and your native language and any other languages to get your research done, you just have to publish it in English afterwards. Professors at French, Chinese, etc. universities don't go around thinking in English all day.

A childish way to dismiss counter-arguments with ""told you so"", but please go on.

&gt;but from my own personal experience with Greek academia and historiography.

I really doubt that somebody who has even remote contact with academia would take the time to troll Reddit with alt-right talking points as you do.

&gt;He simply was a right winger

He ""simply"" suspended habeas corpus, freedom of speech,  and threw political opponents in torture camps.

&gt;One gets a sense that Metaxas is purposely left out of the story in many cases.

You are saying this, unironically, on the very day of a national holiday celebrating one of his direct decisions. If anything, the fact that this day was chosen as Greece's day to commemorate  WWII speaks volumes about the lengths the post-war right-wing regime went to to whitewash Metaxas' time in power.

&gt;openly left wing academics and historians have been a very prominent group in your academia arguably since the military dictatorship of the 60's and early 70's fell

Using ""Muh regressive left"" as an argument, from an historian? Very likely.

&gt;In western academia and historiography. Metaxas is very much painted in good light. If you read British sources for instance it's mostly positive.

Unsurprisingly, since he acted like a British colonial governor in everything except name.

&gt;This is why generally Greek sources and historiography for the 20th century is deemed often as unreliable past the 70's

\[Citation needed\]

&gt;This is a big problem with your country the extremely partisan nature of your politics infects literally everywhere and it makes working or collaborating with Greek academics frustrating and just annoying as they all seem like they are pushing a political agenda

Of course, I'm sure you've collaborated with academics extensively.

2964,"Amazing, excellent work. Good to see that someone else picked up the slack for me (I don't have much time these days to make these weekly posts). Allow me to point out a few other interesting municipal negotiations.

* [Ghent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghent) is still in deadlock. Right now four parties (who have a huge majority counted together) are negotiating for a new city executive and two politicians claim the mayorship. The leftwing cartel (=joined list) of sp.a and Groen (which had the most votes) originally had someone of sp.a as main candidate, but as Groen ended up the bigger of the two parties, they offered the mayorship to green alderman Filip Watteeuw. On the other side liberal alderman Mathias De Clercq of Open Vld (who had the most personal votes, but his party became second) also claims the mayorship, and he teamed up with the smaller Christian democrats of CD&amp;V. To make things more complicated the cartel wants Open-Vld to drop CD&amp;V, while Open Vld and CD&amp;V want Groen to kick sp.a out of the cartel.
* In the Brussels municipality of [St.-Jans-Molenbeek/Molenbeek-St.-Jean] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint-Jans-Molenbeek) the PS has become *incontournable*, after they were put in opposition six years ago by a coalition of liberals, Christian democrats and greens. The PS list was lead by Catherine Moureaux, the daughter of [Philippe Moureaux] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Moureaux)... who was the mayor of Molenbeek for decades until he was dethroned six years ago. Moureaux was very controversial, to say the least, many find him responsible for keeping a blind eye to the rising Islamic extremism in the municipality. [A picture of Moureaux being celebrated by a group of Muslim men] (https://moustique.cdnartwhere.eu/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/20181016moureaux-11.jpg?itok=J4a04xWR) went viral, which didn't help to take away the fears that the old days of papa Moureaux would return. Moureaux took up negotiations with the greens and the far left PVDA/PTB, but those talks failed, so now PS will probably team up the liberal MR of incumbent mayor Schepmans.
* [Vilvoorde] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilvoorde) was one of the few places in which the Flemish social democrats actually scored well. That didn't stop current mayor [Hans Bonte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bonte) from almost ruining his own chances in this town as well. Bonte ran with a cartel of his own sp.a party and the green party Groen. He promised that the greens would get at least one alderman, but as Groen only managed to get three people elected, all of them with no political experience, Bonte decided to draw back his promise. Groen was pissed about this and wanted to blow up the cartel. Open Vld, with who Bonte wanted to form a coalition, ended the coalition talks and proposed to form an alternative coalition with N-VA and Groen but without the sp.a of Bonte. Bonte is willing to reconsider his opinion about a green alderman and hopes to restart the negotiations next week. If he fails, Vilvoorde will be yet another Flemish city lost to the sp.a.

Research is so complicated and these rankings are heavily biased towards quantity over quality so you end up with a map like this where the UK has supposedly twice more top universities per capita than Germany and even more than that compared to France. If you look at how research works in Germany and France you'll realise that they cannot fair well in rankings like this because it's done very often outside universities. In France for example we have one of the largest research centre in Europe and in the world, it's called the CNRS and thousands of researchers work there. But it's not a university, so it's valued nowhere in these rankings despite being highly regarded all around the world.

Just to be clear I am not saying all the countries ranking well have crappy universities. The UK has top universities all over, and there are top universities all over Asia as well of course.

3044,"If you name a specific issue with changing the date in the middle of the day, I might be able to respond to that, but here's my try:

If you mean business hours as given on the website, it's as easy as the following ‚Äì everybody will understand that the business isn't open for several days straight:

    Mon 21--05
    Tue 21--07
    Wed 21--05
    Thu 21--07
    Fri 21--03
    Sat 23--03
    Sun Closed

In order to log entries somewhere, you could go with the same scheme and write down the day that the log business day started. An example for two days in a setting where your work day starts at, say, 2300:

    2018-10-29
    2300: Monday again
    2310: That happened
    0130: Nothing happened
    0320: Something happened

    2018-10-30
    2310: A new working day started
    0230: Things happen

If for some reason you require the date for every entry, it's practically no cognitive load to notice that you've just passed the 00h mark since the last entry. I wouldn't see a need for that unless your business operates 24 hours in which case the date also changes during the work day in the current system.

3055,"France:

Politics:

- **Emmanuel Macron ""doesn't see the link between the assassination of  journalist Khashoggi and France's weapons sales to Saudi Arabia"", says it's ""pure demagogy"" to talk about it.**

France is the third biggest arms exporter in the world, but we never speak about it, it's never brought up in political debates. [The USA are 1st, Russia 2nd].

Coincidentally a documentary was broadcasted this week, entitled ""My country makes weapons"". Very few people watched it and it didn't dominate the news although Kashoggi's murder has been making the headlines and the subject of our weapons sales was for once mentioned by the media. The documentary highlighted our responsability in the selling of weapons to states such as Egypt,  Saudi Arabia, the UAE, China or India (our main clients). As well as the corruption associated to these sales. 

Macron was asked about it and replied: *""What do weapons sales have to do with Mister Khashoggi? I understand the link with Yemen but there isn't any with Mr Khashogg! If we want sanctions, we ought to take sanctions in every sector! In that case we need to stop selling cars.""* [Cause that's exactly the same thing].

- **Trial approaching for former President Nicolas Sarkozy in the ""Bygmalion"" case (= illegal financing of his 2012 campaign)**.

In 2012, candidate for reelection Nicolas Sarkozy spent double the legal amount during his presidential campaign (43 millions instead of 22). The communication agency they used ('Bygmalion') has since been under scrutiny. 

A Court of Appeal rejected the appeal he filed last year, which means the decision to judge him in this case is maintained. BUT he has the right to attempt a final contestation and of course announced he'll take it: he filed an appeal to the Court of cassation. So his trial is still not for tomorrow, but it is approaching. 

And Sarkozy has multiple other judicial affairs tied to him, of course. 

- **Suspicions of wrondoings by 'Far-Left' party leader Jean-Luc M√©lenchon still in the news**.

See my comment in last week's post. Nothing substancial or really new happened this week, but it was still making the news.

Other news:

- **Teachers expressed their grievances towards their administration, following the video of a high-school student aiming at his teacher with a fake gun**. 

Last week a video emerged on social media, in which a student films and laughs while another student threatens a teacher by pointing at her with a fake handgun (asking her to list him 'present' although he did not attend the class). 

Obviously outrage followed, but very soon a hashtag was spread by teachers: ""Pas de Vague"" (=""No wave"" = ""don't draw attention to it""?) to express their frustation about the fact that they are consistently discouraged by their administration to report violent acts. 

The Minister of Education was, as he always is, very quick to react. But some pointed out that he himself had been unreactive when he was in post as a rector....

The (new) Interior Minister announced that hiring policemen in some schools is being considered. Which is reminiscent of Sarkozy. 

- **Contestation of hunters growing, following several deaths**.

Hunting season started a few weeks ago, and as is the case every year, people have died. Cyclists, strollers, hunters. The topic usually doesn't really attract a lot of attention but nowadays we can clearly sense that the public opinion has shifted and hunters are starting to be contested.

3150,"I might be bad at explaining, but i'll try my best to show the differences between the nordic countries and the US.

Sure, it is part of the model to have strong private economy and therefore production, but i believe that the different comes in culture and how much the government has money, in general. 

Nordic countries see that everyone should have a equal chance to thrive, and happily pay  big taxes, and enjoy free education (i am 17 and only thing i've paid for is books and pencils) and nearly free healthcare, meanwhile US has more of competetive attitude to it, which generates a mindset where you do your own living, not anyone else. 

People here trust the government to use the high taxes well, and know who it goes to - in US there are a bit too many people and lack of trust to really pay them a lot. So, the US government has not enough money to meet such needs of social programs and citizens, therefore healthcare and education are a lot more expensive, and things such as military spending create large differences. So to say it's similiar to US? 

No, it simply isn't. I don't think that a country can be an economic superpower, militaristic superpower, and a heaven for each of its' citizens at the same time, as competetiveness is exactly what you want for that. Nordic people see happiness of all and funding everything from birth to death through government as the main focus.

Every country has problem with their public transport services, and because trains are expensive to operate and expensive to fix when something goes wrong (even things like too many wet leaves on the tracks mess up  some train services like), of course it's never going to be perfect. 

I commented about Ireland purely because I'm Irish, though I must say, I think Ireland is a weird case in European terms. For example, DB travels into surrounding countries (such as the Netherlands, Austria etc.). Therefore, it is in DB's interest to make sure that the services in these countries is up to scratch for their trains. This leads to DB investing in local services, such as track maintenance. 

Ireland, on the other hand, is an island nation with no bridges or other connections to mainland Europe. Though we do border with the UK, there is only one train line up to Northern Ireland (it follows the east coast and around until it reaches Derry). That leaves most of Northern Ireland with no rail services, and so there is almost no investment in Irish Rail (Iarnr√≥d √âireann) from the UK.

An unmarried Tuscan woman 21 years of age would be seen as past marriageable age, the **benchmark for which was 19 years**, and easily 97 percent of Florentine women were married by the age of 25 years while **21 years was the average age** of a contemporary English bride..

3228,"&gt; Nobody is sweeping that under the rug. We just don't start court cases when it is mentioned.

The issue is, it is almost never mentioned for other figures.

But for political manipuation reasons, you keep hearing the same arguments against islam.

Don't get me wrong, I fully support the right to criticise islam. But I fail to see how calling  Mohammed a pedophile based on old testimonies really helps the situation.

I also wish people would recognise that ""native"" europeans took a step back from religion far before most other continents. Today, lot of people from other regions are trying to catch up in that matter... but constantly shouting to their face that ""their prophet is a pedophile"" and that ""they don't respect women"" is similar to pushing underwater the head of a guy trying not to drown.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to fight radical islam, help moderate muslims not look like fools. Then they can convince their friends that the rest of the world doesn't just blindly hate them, and they just need to make some efforts to live peacefully.

&amp;#x200B;

Some european countries started to reduce the role of the church for more than two centuries, and we still have some christian zealots (thankfully not many) trying to push their agendas. Why should we expect from muslims to do the same in only a few decades?

&amp;#x200B;

And with looooaads of gay porn!üòãüòèüá®üáøüòçüòé(tbh its one of the main reasons why i love the country, and one of the main reasons i really wanna visit the Czech Republic in the future some time, so i can explore that whole world/and the czech sex scene, immerse myself in it all etc. I wanna czech it out!.The beautiful architecture, tasty food, hot people, interesting n rich history &amp; culture are all big draws and more reasons to visit as well of course~). But certainly its no exagerration to say that the Czech Republic does produce some the best gay porn in the entire world. A world powerhouse in that field tbhüëçüòéüòç. I mean porn(both gay &amp; straight) has(and has for most people out there) defo put the Czech Republic on the map in the modern world in a way that nothing else has. Seeing as the country plays a major role on the small screen(by that i mean screens of the worlds phones/laptops/PC Desktops etc)... As many of the Czech nation's most iconic cities have had a starring role in many porno movies/many major n hugely popular porn studios have also, and many of said studios are based there as well(again particulery gay porn, especially what with the likes of Bel Ami Online. Who are the biggest and most popular studio in the entire world iirc). They're merely one of many studios. Prague (along with likes of Budapest/Bratislava/Ljubljana) etc is Europe's and indeed (what with the internet) one of the world's main (gay)porn capitals and powerhouse's. Europe's (gay)porn heartlands are in the Czech Republic etc and Prague is a massive part of that nowadays. The Czech porn industry has again as said(much like Hollywood with its big screen movies filiming in central Europe recently) put the place on the map in a huge way. Czech Europe is not just about Nazi/Soviet era history anymore folksüòèüòé:P. It looks like such an awesome country :P.

If a moderate Muslim feels so attacked over someone having a go at someone who lived 1300 years ago that he rather joins extremists, how moderate is he exactly? A moderate would say: I disagree with you, but I am not going to lower myself to your level over it. Or he just realizes this is not about him, but about the extremists that he does not agree with anyway.

* Fouad Belkacem, the leader of radical islamist group Sharia4Belgium who was imprisoned for 12 years in 2015 because of terrorism, has been deprived of his Belgian nationality by the Antwerp court of appeal. This means he is officially no longer a Belgian (only possible because he also had Moroccan nationality, because you can't make people stateless). It's the first time a Belgian convicted terrorist has been deprived of the Belgian nationality. Source: [news article](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2018/10/23/terrorist-leader-loses-belgian-nationality/).
* You may or may not know, but Belgium is a medium firearms exporting country due to the presence of [FN Herstal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_Herstal) in our country (more specifically in Wallonia). FN Herstal is entirely owned by the regional government of Wallonia, whilst weapon export licenses are also a competence of the regional governments. The jurisdiction over weapons export was regionalized to avoid conflicts, since Flanders regularly opposed weapons sales to foreign countries from FN Herstal. The Walloon government on the other hand is more concerned about the jobs and income FN Herstal provides rather than where those exported weapons will end up. This was showcased again this week by the question whether to suspend arms sales from Wallonia to Saudi Arabia after the Khashoggi murder. (Source: [news article](https://www.lecho.be/economie-politique/international/general/vers-une-suspension-des-ventes-d-armes-belges-vers-l-arabie-saoudite/10061503.html)) French-speaking newspaper L'Echo [has previously reported](https://www.lecho.be/economie-politique/belgique-wallonie/L-Arabie-saoudite-premier-client-des-armes-wallonnes/10024035) that Saudi Arabia was the largest client of Walloon arms sales (a quarter of total sales for 153 million euros).
* A parliamentary commission has approved a bill that will make fingerprints mandatory on our electronic identity cards. The intention is to make identity fraud more difficult in the fight against terrorism, by making it easier to check whether your identity card is actually yours using your fingerprints. The fingerprints will however only be stored on our identity cards an not in a central database. With the approval, parliament defied our Data Protection Authority, who gave a negative advice about the bill because it found that the measure was disproportionate.

* This week, it has been officially announced (after it had already been leaked) that the Belgian air force will buy 34 F-35A Lightning II fighter jets from American defense company Lockheed Martin for 4 billion euros to replace our old F-16 jets. (Source: [news article](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2018/10/25/belgium-to-buy-f-35s/)) The F-35 came out ahead of the Eurofighter Typhoon and the French Rafale. More discussion can be found on the [associated /r/europe thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/9qdihm/belgium_chooses_lockheeds_f35_to_replace_f16_jets/).

**But the hottest news of all is of course the aftermath of the municipal and provincial elections we had on 14 October:**

* In a number of larger towns and cities there are still coalition talks going on to form a governing majority for the next six years. In [Charleroi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleroi), the *Parti Socialiste* (PS) of mayor Paul Magnette got an absolute majority, but they still offered two alderman mandates to the growing marxist party, the *Parti du Travail de Belgique* (PTB). (Source: [news article](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/10/20/charleroi-magnette-ptb/)) The PTB has been growing in Wallonia after some scandals in which PS politicians were implicated, which translated in them getting a non-neglectable amount of seats in municipal and provincial councils in these recent elections. The PTB are seen as more radical leftist and more authentic than the PS. The latest news was that the PTB rejected the offer of Magnette. (Source: [news article](https://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/detail_le-ps-et-le-ptb-de-charleroi-mettent-fin-aux-negociations-aucune-coallition?id=10056631))
* Another general trend is the (slight) growth of the greens, both in Wallonia and Flanders. They are now becoming the main leftist party in Flanders, thereby replacing the socialists in a lot of places (whose position in the political landscape is significantly weaker than their Walloon counterparts from the PS). The greens also for example joined a coalition for the Brussels City government together with the PS.
* In Antwerp, the rightwing mayor Bart De Wever from the N-VA (also the party's chairman) has stated he wants to reconciliate with the greens and socialists now that the elections are over. The electoral campaign in Antwerp has at times been very dirty, with mud, accusations and semi-scandals being thrown around everywhere. The N-VA got about 40% of the votes and is the largest party in Antwerp, which makes them *incontournable* for any governing coalition. If the N-VA would continue the current coalition (with the liberals and christian-democrats) they would only have a majority of one seat in the city council, meaning that basically every councillor would have a veto on everything. This would put the city government in a very weak position. This is the main reason De Wever is looking towards the greens and the socialists, who could offer a more comfortable governing coalition. The only problem is that those have positioned themselves as the polar opposite of De Wever's policy. They risk being seen as hypocrites if they would cooperate now with De Wever, which is important because in May there will be new regional and federal elections. On the other hand, if they reject De Wever's offer, they risk being seen as unreasonable manchildren who are never able to compromise. This wouldn't sit well with people like me who would rather see the greens join coalitions so they can steer the ship towards a more environmental direction (even if it's only a little bit).
* In the area around the [Dender river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dender) in Flanders, the rightwing and extreme rightwing parties have made a lot of gains. Since the late 80s, all mainstream political parties in Flanders have promised never to join a coalition with the extreme rightwing and Flemish indepentist party Vlaams Blok and their successor Vlaams Belang (the infamous [*cordon sanitaire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordon_sanitaire#In_diplomacy)). However, in a town called Ninove, the local Vlaams Belang wing got 40% of all votes, which poses the question for how long the cordon is still viable. The only way to keep them out of office in Ninove is a grand coalition between all the other parties, which would be in a very weak position. In another Dender town called Aalst, the N-VA is the largest but Vlaams Belang the second largest party (together they would have a majority). There, the N-VA still refused any coalition with Vlaams Belang and is looking towards parties like the christian-democrats for a coalition instead. Possible reasons why the area is voting so rightwing is the higher-than-average poverty level (the Dender area is an old industrial area) combined with an influx of black and muslim people from nearby Brussels (the area has cheaper real estate prices and good railway connections with the capital). This sometimes causes an uptick in 'youth crime' and adds to a general feeling of 'unsafety', in addition to feelings that these 'immirgants' are getting benefits and attention the 'native' poor people aren't getting.

3422,"It's because back in the late 19th-early 20th century when most of the houses on the island where built it was a thriving fishing port due to it being the last great herring period (a phenomenon where the herring came in in huge numbers and stayed for 20-100 years, and then disappered again). The harbor where situated between the two islands and around the edge of the small one (pictured) and each boat had a connected boat house with the same name (every house pictured at the waters edge is a boat house). Then the people who owned and worked the boats of course wanted to live as close to the boat house and boats as possible so they built their houses where there was room left on the interiour of the island. In those days what you did was place four long wooden boards on the ground where you wanted to build, and if they where still there after something like a week or two then that was seen as a legit building permit, because that would have given the neighbours enough time to see the boards and move them.

3461,"&gt; In the UK literally thousands of underage white girls were groomed, raped and pimped 

how many men did this?

Did they do it in the name of their religion? If not, how does it matter?

&gt; And it was covered up by the authorities and the media 

Are/were they not prosecuted and justice served? What are you complaining about?

""People have to know""? Seeyou reactions in this thread, I believe the contrary. Obviously some people are too dim-witted to act rationally in the face of some pieces of information.

When christian priests rape children, it's only ""priests"". No one starts blaming the whole christian community,even if there are thouthand of non-priest christians that covered them.

&amp;#x200B;

But when a group of rapists happe to bu muslims, we HAVE TO claim it out and loud. As if it really mattered. Do you think it makes any difference for those girls that they were muslims?

But certainly having sex with a nine-years old is a pedophilic act. There is no doubt about it. There are also accounts from Aisha herself that support that she was very young, infantile, and Muhammad had a big affection towards young girls:

&gt; Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet (may the blessing and peace of Allah be upon him), and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah‚Äôs Apostle (may the blessing and peace of Allah be upon him) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet (may the blessing and peace of Allah be upon him) would call them to join and play with me.

Hmm.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spectator

&gt;The Spectator is a weekly British magazine on politics, culture, and current affairs.[1] It was first published in July 1828.[2] It is owned by David and Frederick Barclay who also own The Daily Telegraph newspaper, via Press Holdings. Its principal subject areas are politics and culture. Its editorial outlook is generally supportive of the Conservative Party, although regular contributors include some outside that fold, such as Frank Field, Rod Liddle and Martin Bright.

-

&gt; In late 2008, *Spectator Australia* was launched. This offers 12 pages of ""Unique Australian Content"" (including a separate editorial page) in addition to the full UK contents. Readership of *The Spectator Australia* was revealed through a court case as being 3,000.[3] *Spectator USA*, an online-only magazine, launched in early 2018. This covers articles on politics and culture from American writers, as well as carrying across some of the UK content.
&gt;
&gt;Editorship of *The Spectator* has often been a step on the ladder to high office in the Conservative Party in the UK ‚Äì past editors include Boris Johnson (1999‚Äì2005), the former Foreign Secretary, and former cabinet members Iain Macleod, Ian Gilmour, and Nigel Lawson.

Turks

To understand Turkishness, you need to understand Turkish history first.

Our ancestors called themselves Turkmens. Because thats what they were. In Byzantine sources you will see Greeks calling us Turkoman, Turkmen, Turcoman etc. And Turk was the name of all Turkics. So Turk and Turkmen were seperate identities. Not all Turks were Turkmen, but all Turkmens were Turk. We should call ourselves Turkmen like Iraqi and Syrian Turks still do. But our civic identity should be Turk.

Turk, as in civic identity, means Turkmens, Circassians, Kurds, Bosnians, Lazes, Tatars and anyone who accepts this identity.

The problem is that we cannot 100% separate Turkish identity from our Turkic past, so there are problems (Turkification of Eastern Kurds for example). Because Turkmens became Turks.

Well considering what was a working class strike and protest was co-opted by Hungarian Nationalists, raising Hungarian flags, proclaiming the soon-to-be occupation of the city by the Hungarian army and their support for it (Czechoslovakia and Hungary were at the time at War with each other), the crowd then attacked the Czechoslovak Legionnaires, gunshots were fired from windows overlooking the square into the Legionnaires and the Legionnaires were simultaneously attacked by the crowd. At that point they returned fire. So you tell me, when a protest turns violent, calls for the destruction of the newly established nation and attempts to aid an enemy army to capture a city, and attacks the garrison, what should they have done in that situation? Massacres are always bad, but your comment framed this as an innocent protest.

God I hope so. If France and Germany (and Benelux) could be fully integrated the rest of Europe would naturally follow because of the sheer amount of GDP and people and pull that new union would have. 

And it would show that it's not such a boogeyman as well, much like how EEC and EU worked, where over the decades people saw that it's not a bad thing and more and more countries joined in what was initially just Benelux, France, (West) Germany and Italian union.

As for the West, I actually support abolition of the notion of ""west"" as well, but from a different perspective, not from the perspective of ""liberal democratic order is collapsing"" but from the perspective of ""west is a historical remnant of Cold War that keeps us locked on Cold War thinking, and that's directly harmful to the project of European integration"". Because west is always US and Western Europe always along the old Cold War lines and always with the assumption of US leadership. 

There are two things wrong there, 1) the notion of US leadership and especially the notion that such leadership is necessary for Europe in the 21st century and 2) the notion that western Europe is inherently separate and different from eastern Europe, which also runs counter to the European project. Because if there is west then there is also not west and not west is, among others, former communist countries. It's that kind of thinking which encourages Germans or French or Dutchies to view Americans or Canadians - i.e. not Europeans - as inherently closer and more connected to them than eastern Europeans right across the border from them and it has led to, if anything, restrengthening of the Cold War divide between eastern and western Europe.",,/r/europe/comments/9rvrhz/europe_history_division_of_charlemagnes_empire_by/e8knw3h/,nrrp,1540682602

3988,"Ottoman Greeks, Armenians, Jews were closer to the Byzantines than to Ottoman Muslims and Ottoman Turks? Are you sure you are not projecting your own understanding of today‚Äôs Turkish identity to the Ottoman era?

Re Turkmen, are you assuming that all Turks today are full descendants from them? What about other ancestors of today‚Äôs modern Turks? As you know there is considerable admixture in the population. For sake of argument, if we ignore the encompassing and dominating Muslim identity of the time and recall that nationalism as such didn‚Äôt exist at the time, you do realize that a person who may have had 50% Turkic ancestry could in theory have identified with whatever the other 50% was, let alone if it were less than 50%, such as 30%, 20%, 10%? 

It is clear that at some point the Turkish identity has taken precedence over other identities and this is what the formation of the Turkish *nation-state* also entailed after the enabler that was the dominating and encompassing Muslim identity as well as other cultural, social and other components during the Ottoman era. 

This no way implies there can be no significant Turkic component to be found within Turks. Nor does it imply people who may even have 0% Turkic ancestry cannot be Turks if they have been Turks for generations (assuming no intermarriage into other Turkic ancestry, again in a hypothetical). 

Outside of close-knit tribes and then some, nationality does not necessarily directly correlate with full ancestry. Specially under multinational empires. 

Again this is no different than the many other nationalities out there.

Not at all, Russia is extremely diverse and even more so then. IIRC much of Crimea and southern Ukraine at the time was still populated with Turkic Muslims left over from the Mongols, if any country in Europe at that time could have been balkanized it would have been Russia and also Austria. 

Simplest way to balkanize Russia would have been to create new Russia just in Slavic majority areas and let everyone else free but early 19th century is very beginnings of nationalism so they probably wouldn't have followed national self determination so strictly. That still leaves just about million ways to carve up the country and once its carved up it neutralized gigantic threat to the east of Napoleon's new European order and it forces Russia to deal with internal problems for the next century.

I hope in Poland it is acknowledged today that what poor support Napoleon offered to their country was based on self-interest, his European order if there was one to speak of included no real autonomy for them either and the most interest he ever showed was in the Polish ability to provide him with expendable soldiers to sacrifice instead of French ones.

Pujol was a very smart tactical-wise man, and he achieved lots of things between the current law framework. He was even somewhat venerated in Catalonia, but because he become a publicly known corrupted politician, nationalists/separatists try hard to dissociate his icon with them.

4123,"I understand the risk from your position.  But my point is that what you are proposing is that there be the introduction of a sort of second-class citizen because you feel that they might not support a political initiative that you feel to be desirable.

My view is that citizenship is a serious matter ‚Äî that a country may choose to not extend citizenship to someone, but that if someone is willing to make someone a citizen, then extending them full voting rights enjoyed by other citizens seems like something that should also be a part of citizenship.  They are no child, after all, but as citizen a full shareholder in the stake of the country.  To accept an immigrant as a new citizen is to also accept changing any poitical direction that they bring with them.

If you require a trial or period of accustomization, that is what non-citizen residency is for.

If simple numbers were a concern, then Ireland could obviously impose annual naturalization limits, and I'd have no objection to that.  Or not extend a broad offer of citizenship to anyone with an Irish grandparent.

But to say ""I want citizens, but ones of a lower class, who cannot vote on matters of import""‚Ä¶that to me seems most objectionable.  One might also point out that [a historical Irish Catholic grievance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disenfranchising_Act) was just such a disenfranchisement .  One can imagine a Protestant in Ireland making a very similar argument to the one you just made, that naturally Catholics are welcome to live on the island and work it, but to permit political representation would invite all manner of dangerous and undesirable political positions.

Finally, I'd add that I think that EU members have a special responsibility to avoid the institution of a second-class citizenship with limited voting rights.  Because all citizens of EU members have the right to freely move among and work in the EU, there is the most-unusual situation where any of 28 countries may select new residents and workers in the other 27 members by way of their own immigration policy.  The only disincentive they have to simply letting in anyone with cash is that in granting citizenship, not merely permanent residency, they also must extend the rights and privileges accorded a citizen in their own country.  The most significant there is the vote.  If EU members begin upon a system where they can (a) sell citizenship, which many now do, and (b) can exclude those immigrant citizens from the domestic vote, then what you have just created is a system where 27 other countries can sell work visas to your country, without you having any control over the amount of people who enter or the criteria used to filter these people.  Nor will your country receive any part of the proceeds of the sale of citizenship.  That seems likely to be a situation that EU members would not want to bring about.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/9ron89/ireland_votes_71_to_repeal_the_constitutional/e8k6mka/,vokegaf,1540665468

4900 Albanians live in NM, wouldn't be the first time they started fighting each other, i mean after that Pyramid scheme slaughter..

Sure buddy, whatever floats your boat. 

&gt;Dacic Vucic Dadic ""Milosevic was Missunderstood"" are not 20 months ago let alone 20 years ago.

&gt;He was exposed as a Serb. Google Translate the last messages where the piece of shit was found before he deleted his account. You also deliberately linked the wrong thread :)

Which ones?

You do realise a Opinion poll is a survey, and you haven't linked a Survey, just a reddit thread, i'd brush up on some reading and comprehension skills.

&gt;You keep waving this EU deal to me like I care. I am pretty sure I am the most vocal anti-EU albanian in reddit. Its like waving Nigeria to a Neo Nazi. Am I supposed to be sad? Impressed? Because im mostly just confused.

Sure thing bud.

&gt;We've never peaked unlike you did. Albania started a poor country, developed into a poor communist country and came out even poorer in the 90s. Serbia had the luxury of having International Allies, support by Europe and Russia, unofficial leader of Yugoslavia and whats now? Just another name on the top 10 poorest countries of Europe. Here with us. 

We're way ahead of you buddy, don't put us in that bunch.

&gt;If sea doesn't matter that much you wouldn't have went full ape shit over Montenegro and N. Albania where both times you were denied Sea Access. Only an idiot who has 0 knowledge in economics says : Sea Access is irrelevant. Dushan was such a donkey for fighting to keep sea access.

Im not saying it's irrelevant, im sayin it doesn't matter much, the richest nation per capita on Earth, Switzerland, is landlocked.

And here we have Albania, who has a giant coast, and what is it used for? Dumping trash on Croatia lmao.

&gt;That makes it worse actually.

Still ahead buddy.

&gt;If only we were like Serbia. 

If only, maybe somebody would take you seriously.

&gt;. We should've been more like Serbs and rebel only twice in 400 years of Ottoman harems. 

Apparently history is also foreign to you, not a surprise.

&gt; We should adopt traditional ancient slavic serbian stuff like Cevapi, Turbo Folk, Rakia and 9000 words from this ancient alien race H.P. Lovecraft called : Turks.

It's all in French but the gist of it is that Aljazeera and its sub-channels, here AJ+, is a network that is far from being shy when it comes to enforce division, fight secularism, denounce Israel, obsess over races being not represented enough or religions being disrespected, whine over ""cultural appropriation"" or ""white guilt"", etc.

This sub-channel explained in the article is explicitly enforced the PIR agenda. A small far-left party notoriously known for working against the unique French integration and human rights system, where everyone is French before anything else. As it is, they're opening conferences forbidden to white people thus promoting division and hatred between the whites and the ""raced"", saying that French culture/cops/justice is intrinsically islamophobic, and other venereal shittalking, like, well, racism being not possible against the whites. They're seen as complete jokes, but they're unfortunately getting traction, and their alliance with the main far-left party got them public representation. There is once again this paradox -or schizophrenia- at work, with muslim extremists working hand in hand with communist European parties against the system.

I mean, on one hand, yes, it might have been admirable to refrain.  On the other hand, when someone's suddenly shoved you to the ground and then spends some time punching you in the face and you finally manage to get back on your feet, punching them back in the face rather than turning the other cheek seems somewhat understandable.

I know off-the-cuff of military figures in at least Italy, Germany, the US, and the UK who believed that bombing cities would cause collapse in war effort, and while I haven't read up on it, my guess was that this was a circulating concept among the fledgling air forces of the major military powers during the interwar period.  Figuring out ways in which fledgling air power could be used to solve the great military puzzle of the time ‚Äî how to break the defensive stalemate and attrition produced in World War I by the machine gun and barbed wire was, I expect, a matter of great military interest between World War I and II.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Douhet

&gt;General Giulio Douhet (30 May 1869 ‚Äì 15 February 1930) was an Italian general and air power theorist.  He was a key proponent of strategic bombing in aerial warfare. He was a contemporary of the 1920s air warfare advocates Walther Wever, Billy Mitchell and Hugh Trenchard.

-

&gt;In his book Douhet argued that air power was revolutionary because it operated in the third dimension. Aircraft could fly over surface forces, relegating them to secondary importance. The vastness of the sky made defense almost impossible, so the essence of air power was the offensive. The only defense was a good offense. The air force that could achieve command of the air by bombing the enemy air arm into extinction would doom its enemy to perpetual bombardment. Command of the air meant victory.
&gt;
&gt;Douhet believed in the morale effects of bombing. Air power could break a people's will by destroying a country's ""vital centers"". Armies became superfluous because aircraft could overfly them and attack these centers of the government, military and industry with impunity, a principle later called ""The bomber will always get through"". Targeting was central to this strategy and he believed that air commanders would prove themselves by their choice of targets. These would vary from situation to situation, but Douhet identified the five basic target types as: industry, transport infrastructure, communications, government and ""the will of the people"".

Most of the things you listed happend over 20 years ago, and i should remind you that you started killing each other over a pyramid scheme at that time.

Accounts and dates which prove nothing lmao.

&gt;When did I say Spicy is all of them? You even admitted theyre sock accounts which proves im right. 

Why wouldn't i say they're sock account? They obviously are, im just saying i don't know whos they are.

&gt;Proof? Source? Link? 

I can't link you my inbox.

&gt;I linked his thread wtf are you talking about? Im the 2nd person to do so.

You didn't link the comment that said he's Serb.

https://www.reddit.com/r/kosovo/comments/9r1h8e/serbian_took_reurope_over_albanians_get_perma_bans/

&gt;The fact that videos regarding the same topics pop up. With one getting removed,downvoted or completely overwhelmed by sock accounts is my point. 

You're also missing the point, that video had no context, the one from Serbia did have context and is a current event.

You said anti-Serb posts are removed, while anti-Albanian posts stay up, which implies the mods are biased.

&gt; A random guy from r/europe doesn't have the slightest idea of what Balkan countries are let alone what their problems are.

maybe, maybe not.

&gt; You also are passively accepting that you are O.K. with Tvrtko.

Why wouldnt i be? what is he doing that's illegal?

&gt;I gave you comments and a serbian article. Then I told you to google your Serbian media sites which you didn't. 

That's not a poll.
You said you have a poll.

&gt;Its funny because back in the Bosnian threads you use my links against them and go : LuL you guys sit in reddit all day guess unemployments really bad there.

Thats outdated like 2015-6 or so. It's currently 11.9 and 12.9 for Serbia and Albania.

&gt;I know I giggle myself when people like you think you matter in the grand scheme of things to either Russia or Landlocked

Whos landlocked? :D is it a new country?

yeah, we don't matter, that's why we're frontrunners in the EU, while you got denied talks.

&gt;Landlocked

Yeah, you're not landlocked, but you still have a shittier economy, almost like it doesnt matter much?

&gt; with 0 strategic values

suuuuure.

&gt;dwindling population,one of the lowest birthrates in EU

Im glad you already regard us the EU &lt;3

&gt;and an economy so bad that can only compare itself with Albania Kosovo and Bosnia.

Quite a bit more, add Moldova,Ukraine and the Causcasus states and we're doing pretty well.

4307,"&gt;What consent did I give to download all of those files? I typed in the URL and pressed enter. I requested the website. The website did not unilaterally decide to send those files to me.

You requested a website, not the ability for corporations to track your every move online. Which they mostly do through cookies.

&gt;That's the point. You would actually have some assurances of your privacy that do NOT rely on a random website upholding EU laws. In this case it would be up to the user to decide how much hassle they are interested in engaging with and it doesn't force everyone to be inconvenienced.

This is basically saying: we should not have regulations for companies, but do everything ourselves. I'll be sure to sent my food to a laboratory before eating it, because I am responsible for what I eat.

&gt;If they actually care about privacy? Yes. If they think this is a problem worth their while then they will look into it.

People are not aware. Which is why companies make it so hard to understand. If you get an alert when booting up your browser that says: Do you want corporations to track all your activity online, sell it to others and make money from it? Yes or No. What do you think people are going to choose? And that is exactly why they don't want to ask that question clearly.

&gt;There is plenty of evidence that regulations like this have caused problems in the past. And at this point we already have this and this to show that Google is the main beneficiary of GDPR at the expense of small companies. Note that these are the same source, but they visualize the data differently.

That is about advertising companies. Not business in general. They should adapt and Google and Facebook are still breaking the law anyway, court cases are coming already about it.

&gt;but if the DPA is having a bad day they might just end a small company.

That is not how any of this works. There are judges and courts for rulings still.

&gt;Oh yeah, don't forget that we even have 28 different DPAs over the EU as well. Isn't that magnificent?! Some of the smaller ones have a dozen or two dozen employees total.

So now the problem is again lack of enforcement, while at the same time saying small businesses die because of enforcement. Which is it?

&gt;No, it isn't. The regulation basically exists to help large multinational business interests. It's the usual thing that regulation of this kind does: push out all of the competition and make it as hard as possible for new companies to start up. This is how you get monopolies.

Compared to what? Because everything is already heading into a monopoly online.

&gt;Looking at the big picture, this is probably the most important part of it. If automation is the future of humanity then that means we must have strong skills in related fields: technology and machine learning. GDPR makes machine learning much more difficult and it also hurts European technology companies.

Ah, so because it only happens to a few people, it isn't important? I can certainly tell you it matters a whole lot to those 150 people.

&gt;Bad comparison. Having sex without birth control is the reason of the pregnancy, and justifies ""risking the life"" of someone.

Or having sex WITH birth control that somehow failed.

I just disagree with the argument that is only boils down to ""a woman (or anyone really) does whatever she wants with her body regardless of the consequence for others""

4360,"&gt; We have access to the canonical biblical sources


Yeah, it's not all that different from Canonical Harry Potter. You don't get to use made up stories to prove a point about Jesus actually existing. It doens't change anything that those made up stories are collected in a big book called the Bible.


There is not a single piece of evidence in the Bible that Jesus actually existed, much less that he ever performed a single miracle. Because there is nothing remotely contemporary confirming any of it.


&gt;These sources are analysed with methods developed in modern times and put into context with information we have about the region and the time period. 


Really, then how are the huge factual errors explained, for instance the obvious geographic confusion. Could it be that these methodologies were developed with heavy bias? 


&gt;What do you mean by that. Modern scholars do not claim that he was seen as very important at his time. His followers certainly didn't think that he revered outside of his following.


If he was the son of a God that created everything, and was sent here to save humanity, then obviously he would be to all his followers.


&gt;There is however plenty of evidence of people claiming supernatural powers having a following believing in them like for example Theudas.


Yes that happens all the time even today, I recently read an article describing how a goat was judged by a court for actually being a wizard trying to hide. So what's your point?


&gt;Non Theudian sources would only mention him briefly and would be written long after his death. Theudian sources would be much more detailed but would be full of supernatural claims about him.


Ah so your point is that lack of evidence of a mostly insignificant person, justifies the lack of evidence for a person claimed by billions to have been the most important person who ever lived, who they claim performed miracles, and those miracles are the foundation of their religious beliefs.

4504,"&gt; Are all the mutations called tumors ?(btw, is it a cancer if it is deemed non-benign and not one if it isn't ?)  

No. It's a tumor only if the cells stop playing their ""normal"" role.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not expert, but i believe benigns tumors are non-cancerous tumors. They don't grow.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; and followup question if i get it right, does it mean that only cancer-suffering people are experiencing dna changes even on a small scale ?  

Everyone experiences single-cell, isolated mutations. Depending on how the mutation turns out, your body may try to destroy it.

&amp;#x200B;

Cancer is when the mutated cell multiplies uncontrolably and, for some reason, the body doesn't win the fight and needs help.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I believe radiations also cause mutations right ? 

Yes, nuclear ratiotion (""radioactivity"") are high energy particles (there are different kinds) that can go deep in your body and with their high energy affect the structure of the molecules (break them, rearrange them etc..). When they affect ""regular""  molecules it's not a big deal, usually the cell survives, and if not, it's only one cell that dies.

&amp;#x200B;

When it affect DNA, it can cause a cancerous mutations.

&amp;#x200B;

There is radiation everywhere, everything emmits nuclear radiation in micro-micro-microscopic amounts. It's the amount of radiation that multplies your chances of getting mutation"".

4544,"&gt; I think you‚Äôre being a little bit insulting when you say ‚Äúinconvenienced for nine months‚Äù as if the pain of parenthood lasts only for the duration of pregnancy and then everything is sunshine and roses. 

I was talking about the scientific aspect of them problem. [Here is my whole analysis of the problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/9ron89/ireland_votes_71_to_repeal_the_constitutional/e8jh6yh/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Either the parents tear their lives apart raising the child and being parents for the rest of their lives, or **they give the child away and spend the rest of their lives upset that they never got to see their child grow up**, and dooming the child to having a nagging fear that their own parents didn‚Äôt love them enough to keep them. Those emotional bonds don‚Äôt just disappear just because they‚Äôre conveniently pushed under the rug by the state and the religious fundamentalists.

Though I agree with most of what you say there is an incoh√©rence I bolded in the middle.

How is it better to ""get rid"" of the foetus than giving it up if they reall want to see him grow?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In any case, there are far too many children in care already who would love to have people adopt them- and yet adoption rates are astonishingly low. Somehow I don‚Äôt see these religious fanatics that insist that unwanted children be born into this world without a parent‚Äôs love taking the lead and adopting.

Garibaldi had no control over this, he was a patriotic soldier of fortune. Cavour was the PM of the House of Savoy, he sold off their homelands in order to unite/conquer Italy. It was given to the French under Napoleon III who sent French armies to help Piedmont/ 'Sardinia'/Kingdom of Savoy /Vittorio Emannuele II conquer Milan from Austria, along with parts of central Italy. Bonapartes had Italian origins, and Napoleon III wanted to live up to Napoleon I and would have liked a vassal state.

Southern Italy/Bourbons/'Two Sicilies' was a fun one as the royal family traded loyalties between Britain and Russia. Britain helped re-impose them after Napoleon, but they were friendly with Hapsburgs and Romanovs because they helped restore them after a series of republican and feudal insurgencies.

4658,"Doesn't look like a paradox to me.  We've got the KKK and the Nation of Islam free to express the idea that people should be killed off, which is a lot more-extreme than what you're talking about banning here ‚Äî this isn't even a matter of hate speech ‚Äî and it's been fine.

You don't like the far right, fine.  I think that there are plenty of unfortunate ideas in the far right (though that's not somewhere where they possess a monopoly).  But once you say ""I am in government and therefore I have better judgment than the public at large as to what political ideas are appropriate ‚Äî rather than convince people of the merit of my ideas, I will ban the dissemination of those I oppose"", you move away from democracy.  And you can hardly expect your own political groups not to be banned if someone comes into power that doesn't like them, if your society does not hold as essential and inviolable a pluralism of political views.

I'm reminded of the outcry over Poland.  PiS used their position in government to cause the state press to support them.  If one objects, they can point at PO and say ""Ah, but PO did this as well.  How can you object if you are not willing to hold PO to the same standard you ask me to follow?""

Ban groups now, and you commit yourself to risk that some government may come to power that will not like *your* political associations and ban them ‚Äî you'll expend your credibility to object to that.  Further, remember that this is an EU-level position which would affect even country-level politics.  Are you comfortable with Brussels deciding what political groups may exist in France?  Maybe today *you* are even more politically-aligned with Brussels than with Paris.  But will you be tomorrow, and every tomorrow after that?  What if a coalition with which you do *not* agree comes to power in Brussels and aims to consolidate its position by shaving away opposition political groups across the EU?

I would be outraged if the federal government in the US proposed banning political organizations, even if they are those with which I entirely disagree.

Remember the paraphrase of one of your famous philosphers:

&gt; I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.

Where to start. I‚Äôm Italian, kinda proud of my heritage and my culture, very dissatisfied with the current conditions of my country. I lived, quite extensively, all over Europe and the US too. So I would consider my opinion based on direct personal experience (in contrast with an academic one)

Your textbook analysis of my country is simply that. Factual? Meh. Backed by statistics? Probably. Depicting reality? Far from it. 

Instead of bashing a country for its many possible flaws you did not stop for a second to think its many positive traits, nor, most importantly, what the OP is actually looking for... (a post a bit above asked all the right question with no further details given)

But, I could reverse the whole bashing post with the following:

Do you enjoy watching the landscape drastically changing in less than an hour by car from every single point of our borders?
Do you enjoy the arts? We have every single major artist that walked the face of the earth on display (and most of the time for free), ok this might be debatable depending on subjective taste, but you got the hyperbole. 
Do you enjoy food? We have one of the most diverse, complex and rich food traditions you could find. You wanna object? Ok, add -for square mile-
Weather. Despite all the efforts by humankind we still have reasonable weather and we can still notice the changes of seasons
Do you like mountains? Dolomiti
Do you like the sea? Pick almost anywhere on the map
Do you like the lake? Too many to mention, let‚Äôs start just with Garda, Orta, Como
Do you like rivers and waterfalls? Unique landscapes, please name something that we don‚Äôt have. Ok maybe icebergs but probably that would be a scary thing to have anyway
Do you wanna live isolated? You can
Do you wanna live in a small village (100 to a 5000 people)? You can
Do you wanna live in a big city (over a million) you can and it still will be human-sized
The whole country is run by the mob? Maybe you have a better in depth knowledge of the situation of my country, and i have no issue whatsoever to acknowledge the fact that we have an issue with organized crime, but unless OP is into an illegal operation or decides to buy a house in one of the nono neighborhood, i can safely say that he won‚Äôt run into movie-like scenarios. Same for the corruption part, unless OP wants to become a tycoon or a real state developer i can safely say the same as above.
burocrates? That is our specialty, and yes you will have to deal with it. But you retiring so you can spare a little bit of time. 
Expensive country? I can challenge you on that. But i can safely guess that with the same income he might have a higher standard of living
we are currently having a non-idillic political scenario, and i‚Äôm far from happy believe me. 
But at the same time we are one of the more welcoming (after a reasonable period of assessment) populations around...

But in the end you know why against better judgement i never left europe and probably never will? Because with a plane and less than 2 hours i can visit at least 50 completely different cities every time i feel like. 

Besides all bias views and conclusions i would like to say something, if your goal for your retirement is to enjoy life you could do that anywhere in the world, but we have here quite few things and the right mentality to help you reach that goal

Look, I'm probably a blind, ignorant, cynical nobody, but my impression is that all the economical ""help"" is given to country that can be exploited by national companies that manage resources like oil and minerals (like Italy did with Nigeria), and that ""help"" is given in the form of (subtle?) corruption to the people in charge of places of interest. Basically nothing trickles down to the common folks who are struggling, but instead keeps feeding the oligarchy that enslaves them.  

Europe is not able to send people back either, since they must be allowed to file for asylum even if they wouldn't be eligible for it. They have found a way to bypass all the legal queues by jumping on a raft and calling the non-profit organizations to have them brought to europe (it seems the only ""safe"" harbors in the Mediterranean Sea are European), forcing others to make the same choice (why going the legal way if you can be sure to be taken care of by going the illegal way?).  

Note that countries like Italy do NOT have the resources to help other countries ( [Italy's national debt is, at the moment of wrinting, 140,53% of its GDP](https://www.nationaldebtclocks.org/debtclock/italy) ) and Italy does not have the resources needed to handle such an [heavy migration pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Italy#/media/File:Migranti_sbarcati_in_Italia_1997-2016.png) , not after the many earthquakes that devastated entire regions.  

So, to sum up: Italy's must take care of every struggling soul in the Mediterranean Sea due to international laws, it doesn't have enough resources to handle the migration crisis and most of the other european countries are either not willing to help, or are gradually withdrawing their help due to internal issues with migrants.  

Basically Italy's between a rock and a hard place. Salvini is just the voice of Italians' desperate frustration at being ignored.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/9rs2nk/three_arrested_for_rape_and_murder_of_italian/e8jfp92/,Tirkad,1540630416

4699,"The TL;DR answer is : no. The chances of changing your whole body to a new DNA are probably equivalent to winning the lottery every second for 100 years (I may be exagerating, I'm not even sure, but you get the idea). And even in that case it would be the equivalent to changing one word in a book.

&amp;#x200B;

Many factors provoke mutations in your body proably every day. Most mutations are either non-viable, or have no impact on the cell's function.

Some mutations make the cell ""crazy"" and replicate itself at a high rate : that's what we call cancerous mutation. Your body kills those cells usually. It's in the rare case where it fails to do so and the mass of cancerous cells grows beyond control that is a cancerous tumor.

In very rare cases, the mutation would be viable and have an impact (positive or negative) on the way it functions.

&amp;#x200B;

Even in this rare case, that's only one cell in the billions in your body that has mutated. In time it will replicate, but the other cells do too, and there's little chance that this cell's new DNA will take over the whole organ. And certainly not your whole body.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, since it won't affect your sperm cells/ovulae, this mutation will not be carried on to your progeny. Only mutations that happen in those cells can be transmitted, in which case the rest of your body won't mutate. MEaning you passed a mutation to your child, but you don't ""have"" that mutation in your own DNA.",,/r/europe/comments/9ron89/ireland_votes_71_to_repeal_the_constitutional/e8jfqub/,jack_in_the_b0x,1540630519

Honestly, I dont care about the territorial stances. Some support it, some dont. It still shouldn't be part of sporting events, they are accusing refugees as being terrorist and such. Other countries interfering in disputes that they dont know anything about needs to be questioned. It just raises tensions between the 2 countries.

Haha oh boy. Here we go again.

&gt;I don't remember any Albanians shot in NK in the last 10 years.

Thats like saying I don't remember any escimo being shot in the Middle East. However we have these little gems of cases than happen everytime one albanian does cross to the serbian side :

Tell you what. Lets make a deal. I will move over to South Mitrovica, you move over to North Mitrovica. You will feel safe among your own no?

&gt;Don't avoid the question, as i said, English source.

Why are you pretending I didn't give you english links :) Oh. Now I remember. You went stage 2 Helskrim which is : Oh this source is trash/anti-serbian/bad/not reliable. The usual.

&gt;You accused me of using alts before, now im the '3hd' iteration of whoever. There is no act to drop, this is my first and only reddit account, other than a throwaway that i used for one askreddit thread and deleted, i started using Reddit last year when i started colledge because a mate made me do it, i used 4chan before that and some minor forums. And as i said,

Never said you were an alt. You are still going at this? You have been active in reddit for much, much  longer than 2 years. If its any consolation, all of this info and more about your little cabal came from Serbian guys. 

&gt;i've been in contact with the admins of reddit 3 times,

Why?

&gt;and had i been breaching some sort of rule, i would be banned, i was not, and they were really professional when dealing with brigades brigading r/europe and r/serbia.

They have done a piss poor job at it. None of the Accounts I have listed are banned. None have gotten banned for breaking the rules like when you guys were having a siptari trigger finger fest in a thread here and then tried to play it dumb: Its not a bad word. 
Best of all. The mods actually removed the 1 humorous thread to come out of the balkans because ""it broke the rules"". What did not break the rules are identical threads to it before and after its removal.

&gt;Serbians of Kosovo means Kosovo is Serbia, since a Serbian is a citizen of Serbia, thanks, it seems we agree.

Its okay. Denial is the first stage. One day you too may visit your Serbian brothers in Albania. 

&gt;on discord. Not on r/europe. He never said he used alts on reddit afaik.

Oh wow. If he goes as far as to admit opening alts on discord for r/croatia and r/bosnia. what makes you think he can't use the same e-mails for reddit? Not to mention it has been discovered he is not even from the balkans  but Moldovan. 

&gt;Again, do you have any proof?

Already answered this.

&gt;What's the proof he's Serbian?

Ditto.

&gt;You're doing that yourself, if you don't want people to view you as such, maybe stop stoning buses or pilgrims. (not you personally).

Don't you guys hold threads about how Europe is serbophobic and reddit in general has unholy crussades of alt account armies to bring you guys down? Like you are doing here. In yet another Kosovo thread either downvoted to oblivion or removed entirely. You know like the Bosnian grave map,the Albanian burned buildings,the Bosnian meme pic and whatever gets posted that serves as a counter point to Tvrtko's weekly diarrhea.

&gt;Link to the comment?

Ditto. 

&gt;You said you had polls that Serbians believe Ivanovic was killed by Vucic, and you failed to provide them

Oof sure I did.

&gt;as you did everything else in this thread.

Not really. I got you talking. Now I know you're the one talking to mods and why threads you generally dislike disappear after your damage control has failed.

&gt;But when faced with real accusations of corrupt politicians, like drug dealers in your government, you back out of the discussion.

I know. Its such a shame we can't have Vucic and his party to lead us. Those guys deffinitely don't have ties to mobs. Only his kid does.  Also you should stop with the whole ""Drug Dealers in your government"". I already proved it as fake but like most stuff you ignore it entirely in your  adrenaline filled ""pRoFz"" spam.

&gt;With that in mind, no wonder the EU denied you accession negotiations.

Pfff your jabs have gotten worse. Might it be because now you have accepted you have more unemployed that us so you are not using the usual "" Lul you guys unemployed"" thing? EU? You think I give 2 shits about EU? Only union im on is the infamous Kosovo-Albania union that will 100% happen because Edi Rama said so in an interview.

To answer your example, if a Muslim were to say that all Jews needed to be silenced or that Judaism is an evil religion, that would also be against Austrian law, because your freedom of religion is equally limited by those same blasphemy laws.

However, you can attack any element of worship that extends outwards such as banning or calling for the banning of clothing, circumcision, the call to prayer or church bells. You can also, quite ironically, freely insult Muslims, as long as you don't insult Islam, so feelings most defiantly aren't being taken in to account.

4893,"&gt; Funny to say Communism failed despite the fact that it pulled hundreds of millions of people out of poverty around the world and provided them with literacy programs, free education and healthcare.

They would've done so even better. Compare Finland to the Baltics. Before communism those 4 countries were at a similar level of development. Look at them now: the 3 that were under communism are far behind Finland in ever measure.

&gt;And to say that these countries are now significantly better under Capitalism is overlooking the fact that this is most certainly not an opinion held by a majority that live in many ex-communist states.

Communism gave advantages to those that they resettled to other countries. Of course those people will miss communism because they had an advantage back then. Couple that with constant state propaganda and people will be of the erroneous opinion that life was better back then.

4903,"Pheeew so this is a hefty list to take on and this is of course only my personal/anecdotal experience and opinion mostly. But to answer at least a few of your questions:  

\-8 million people is not as much as other countries, yet you still have a looot. I never ""felt"" limited in that regard. 

\-Best or worst? This is very personal i guess but i just love the mountains. Google ""Gro√üglockner"" (highest mounten in Austria with over four thousand meters)   

\-I personally know the see only form vacations and while it is nice there and I enjoy the atmosphere, it is nothing i would miss normally. Maybe others will see that differently though. Kind of hard to grasp for someone from an island though i guess :P  

\-Austria is generally regarded as a very laid back country. A lot of germans like to visit us in thier vacations because of it. Also good beer, skiing, and a lot of history makes for a lot of great vacation destinations.  

\-Austria is doing pretty great from an economic standpoint. Right now as well as when we joined the EU. In fact Austria has seen a tremendous growth in GDP after joining and thus benifited a lot. Today it is a common location for international HQs since it is located in the hearth of Europe with great infastructure, great education system, high standard of living, good earning potential with pretty decent PPP (what you actually get for your money in terms of average good prices etc.) and of course low crime rates in generall  

\-Again this is my personal opinion again. But i feel like we have a love hate relationship with the germans. Depending on the topic and the people. Generally it is a close one tho. Also economically.  

\-Austria still has a focus and tight diplomatic relations to these countries. See for example its participation in the UN-mission in Bosnia and Kosovo.  

\- I personally feel that there are not too many fat people in Austria just from my daily experience and statistics back this up if compared to the USA for example. However a increasing trend is observable over the last 30 years.  

\-On the LGTB issue. Basicly the pople have their deserved rights and also feminism is a thing in Austria. However it is a lot more moderate issue compared to the USA or UK? i guess. And while everyone gets their fair share of rights it is not overblown into the ridiculus. Yes we do have the third pronoun (other) officially established. But no it's not that big dramatic cringy thing like in the USA  

\-Police are pretty chill normally. And while striking hard when they have to they normally are pretty down to earth, at least in my experience. We don't really have an issue with police brutally as well. And if so it is investigated, prosecuted and live goes on.  

\-The refugee crisis.. Well Austria was comparably fast to react and close its border. Unlike germany who are facing the concequences now. However even tho this is a hot topic and the poplulation feels the need to adress it properly (see the shift to more right wing politicians in the elections) to put it into that drastic perspective is vastly overblown. Austria continues to be a country with one of the highest living standards and high security  

\-Brexit: well basicly anyone i know who is a bit informed on the issue thinks this was incredible stupid. But too late now i guess.  

\-Universitys are free in Austria except for inscription.  

\-Austria also has mandatory social security that is covered by the employer for everyone. Kids etc are also coverd with their parents. So unlike americans you never have to worry to go there from a financial perspective. If you want you can still go to private doctors, where the majority will still be covered by the social security. The quality is pretty good as well, however this is a constant topic in politics and how to properly balance and manage it.   

\- I personally love the italian cuisine. Once you have ate in a good restaurant  in italy, you will probably share my opinion.

&gt;Thus, in the past two years, Germany's society has gained about as many new members over migration as through births of mothers of German nationality. Due to the strong international immigration - the Federal Republic has been receiving more immigrants since the 1960s than the classic US immigration country - the country is quickly becoming a migrant society. According to the Federal Statistical Office, 42 percent of those under the age of six already have a migration background in West Germany.


It's pretty wild to think about those numbers, of less than 60% ethnic continuity per generation, because if those trends kept stable through the entire country that could make a group formerly close to 100% the population shrink to a minority 18% 

In England they are starting to consider ""anglo saxon"" an obsolete term [because it's a specific ethnic tribal reference](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Anglo-Saxon)

&gt;Ethnically, the Anglo-Saxons actually represented an admixture of Germanic peoples with Britain‚Äôs preexisting Celtic inhabitants and subsequent Viking and Danish invaders.

&gt;Anglo-Saxon peoples had become known as England, and Anglo-Saxon as a collective term for the region‚Äôs people was eventually supplanted by ‚ÄúEnglish.‚Äù For some time thereafter, Anglo-Saxon persisted as an informal synonym for English, but that use diminished as emigrants from Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and other areas beyond northern Europe further reshaped Britain‚Äôs ethnic composition.

That's just as wrong. Context is everything when it comes to history. And of course there is more than on part to the story (be it genghis khan or other mass murderers/war heroes, depending on who you ask). 

&gt; The court specifically said that there was no basis in fact in her statement 

I'm not quite sure where you're even reading this? All the relevant parts are:

&gt; ES' statements ""were not phrased in a neutral manner aimed at being an objective contribution to a public debate concerning child marriages,""

&gt; The Austrian courts had drawn a distinction between pedophilia and child marriage, which was also a common practice historically in European ruling families.

&gt;  ES was making value judgments partly based on untrue facts and without regard to the historical context.

Read carefully: ""partly based on untrue facts"" and more importantly ""without regard to the historical context"". They're not contradicting any facts.

I never said they were gonna win or they could win. The entire yugoslav armaments and weaponry were against them while they were armed with Chinese SKSs.

Pure innocents? No. Evil government. Yes.

He is not hiding them in his bathroom. They are dead, its been 20 years since their dissapearance. What he is hiding is their location.

&gt;But you should, cause it not all the same. Slobo wanted power more than anything, he exploited the conflict on Kosovo to get to it and he didn't want anyone opposing him there. Keep everything the same but make you some Slavic group and he'll act them same. And genocide was far from impossible. When you outgun someone so much it's not much of a problem. And Albania itself joining the war would mean little, it's military was extremely weak. Obviously the wider consequences of the conflict becoming international are more important, but even then he could easily kill so many before it fully escalates. And I doubt he thought that only displacing them would get NATO of his back. NATO wanted him gone, they wanted Kosovo for themselves, no matter what he did they would've spun it against him.

5158,"The clauses of the Nazi‚ÄìSoviet Pact provided a written guarantee of non-belligerence by each party towards the other, and a declared commitment that neither government would ally itself to, or aid, an enemy of the other party. In addition to stipulations of non-aggression, the treaty included a secret protocol that divided territories of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and Romania into German and Soviet ""spheres of influence"", anticipating ""territorial and political rearrangements"" of these countries. Thereafter, Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin ordered the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September, one day after a Soviet‚ÄìJapanese ceasefire at the Khalkhin Gol came into effect.

Germany and the Soviet Union entered an intricate trade pact on February 11, 1940, that was over four times larger than the one the two countries had signed in August 1939.[204] The trade pact helped Germany to surmount a British blockade of Germany.[204] In the first year, Germany received one million tons of cereals, half a million tons of wheat, 900,000 tons of oil, 100,000 tons of cotton, 500,000 tons of phosphates and considerable amounts of other vital raw materials, along with the transit of one million tons of soybeans from Manchuria. These and other supplies were being transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories.[204] The Soviets were to receive a naval cruiser, the plans to the battleship Bismarck, heavy naval guns, other naval gear and thirty of Germany's latest warplanes, including the Bf 109 and Bf 110 fighters and Ju 88 bomber.[204] The Soviets would also receive oil and electric equipment, locomotives, turbines, generators, diesel engines, ships, machine tools and samples of German artillery, tanks, explosives, chemical-warfare equipment and other items.[204]

The Soviets also helped Germany to avoid British naval blockades by providing a submarine base, Basis Nord, in the northern Soviet Union near Murmansk.[196] This also provided a refueling and maintenance location, and a takeoff point for raids and attacks on shipping.[196] In addition, the Soviets provided Germany with access to the Northern Sea Route for both cargo ships and raiders (though only the commerce raider Komet used the route before the German invasion), which forced Britain to protect sea lanes in both the Atlantic and the Pacific.[205]",,/r/europe/comments/9rj5n3/ww2_deaths_by_percent_of_prewar_population_in/e8in9bx/,iwanttosaysmth,1540594227

&gt; If that doesn't seem insane to you kudos for being high 24/7.

So you start with a Strawman? My point is not that blasphemy laws aren't stupid and insane, but your interpretation/wish that this is somehow related to ""multiculturalism"" is just wrong. 


&gt; Freedom of speech in demands that you don't have a right to not be offended, and that the state can't give you special cuddles to protect you when you do feel offended (by making sure whoever offends you isn't allowed to speak anymore).

Well Austrian law limits freedom of speech in certain cases regarding religion, that this is stupid is nothing you have to tell me. But there is still no connection to multiculturalism, since these laws were actually made to prevent criticism of Catholicism. 

&gt; Like I said, it's like we're going back in time instead of forward by our awkward obsession with protection religious people so they can keep living in their fantasy world without ever being questioned about the obvious issues.

We are not going back, this law is just something left-over from the past, nobody dared to abolish. Which you would know, if you had any clue about the previous ruling on the same law that happened in 1994 in regards to a film about christianty. 

&gt; The fact that you actually feel offended that I don't like this shows how much we are going backwards.

**First problem:**

&gt; ***Anyone can create a personal web page or publish their own book and claim to be an expert in a certain field.*** For that reason, **self-published media are largely not acceptable**. Self-published books and newsletters, personal pages on social networking sites, tweets, and **posts on Internet forums are all examples of self-published media.**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources

**Second problem:**

&gt; **Here on /r/AskHistorians, we don't qualify the term 'Expert' simply by what degree you hold.** It is our belief that there is a lot of value in longtime, in-depth self-study of a topic, and that an amatuer **[sic]** historian can play as important a role here as a trained professional. While nearly 50 percent are history grad students or have a graduate degree in a history related field, **a large number are self-taught, and any degree they hold is in an unrelated field. We do not discriminate between hobbyists, and longtime professionals**, and rather evaluate expertise based on the quality of one's work. 

And:

These are the dictionaries I found with a quick search. On what authority do you dispute these definitions?

The word ""orthopedics"" comes from the Greek words for ""correct"" and ""child"". Would you argue that ""orthopedics"" is not a word because an orthopedic surgeon most certainly treats all age-groups?

&gt;Whether the concept of swordcanopies/pastclamation/goldfrotting makes any sense or not has no bearing on the word itself existing either.

Yes, I agree.

&gt;Again, it's a string of letters with no meaning that is not non-sensical. Call that what you will.

I would call it a ""word"", and I'd venture that you would too, had you not decided to do the cognitive equivalent of a triple-cork to avoid admitting you were wrong.

5203,"This girl is 16, and she was gangraped while she was OD'ing in an abandoned rail supply station. 

With the 18 year old from before, which lead to the shooting, you could trivialise because she OD'd at a dealer's house who she had some relationship with, some say the 16 year old was set up by a friend who had some relation with the culprits, and him chopping her into pieces is sort of what you expect people to do to cover up a murder. Then you hear that others were arrested and there may be reasons why some of her body parts were missing. Organ trafficking or possibly something else, I have no evidence I read that somewhere I'm completely out of date about that one. Could have all been disproven by now. I hear a lot of sensational stories but its hard to find follow-up, fact checking, corrections, updates etc. 

This one probably did get no attention because culprits were white, then again we talked a lot about every group of whites who attacked migrants after the 18 year old girl was chopped up. The wave of anti-migrant violence after that I think was composed of 6 or 7 incidents and 1 murder that I remember. I think this one doesn't matter so much for public outrage because the victim was a young man and not a child or a woman. 

Racial differences do make crime stories more sensational and interesting since you can make assumptions. With people of the same demographic category its harder to assume, because there's no narrative of conflict, so there could be any reason. Maybe the victim owed the perp money, or some other thing that would even make a reasonable person doubt the victimhood.

Also some violence is not preventable, its easier to see violence by minorities as preventable because it is in a brutal society. If tomorrow all of them left, I am sure these same-same crimes would end up outraging people as much as they used to before diversity was normal. 

We hung Mussolini upside down from a gas station and threw rocks at him, like I'm certain the average Italian is more than capable of finding fault in his own people...probably moreso than many other people. 

But its reasonable for them to be outraged by migrant crime since none of them, or very few, come from a country we abused meaning they are strangers. These culprits were Nigerian and Senegalese, British and French colonies, countries they ruined and we're the ones drafted to pick up the pieces. 

We didn't ship them here as slaves centuries ago and discriminated, they started showing up in large numbers in the 80s. For this latest wave we spent only our money in 2013 or 2014 rescuing them. Fed them housed them all out of pocket. In the eyes of the world we're like employees and our generosity is seen as a task we must do not only for free but at our own expense when we did nothing to depopulate their countries and we aren't even the final destination.

As I said many of the migrants turned up as witnesses and if it weren't for their cooperation we might have more difficulty catching the culprits. A lot of them are really nice, and appreciative, and its natural for everyone to get very angry at the ones who abused our hospitality by raping children.

5211,"There's nothing remotely ""unreasonable"" about pharma profits. 

&gt;Actually, available data* are pretty supportive.

&gt;Another measure, Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is even more telling. IRR calculates the sales/cash flows resulting from R&amp;D investments, ties R&amp;D and the returns it generates together, and is a more appropriate metric for biopharma productivity. Deloitte reports that the IRR for biopharma R&amp;D has been steadily falling from 10.1% in 2010 to 3.2% in 2017. Even Wall Street hasn‚Äôt bought into the ‚Äúpharma soaring profits‚Äù view. Since February 1, 2014, while the Dow has risen 63%, the stock prices of a number of major pharma companies have been muted with Pfizer and Bristol-Myers each growing by about 15%, and Merck and AstraZeneca by roughly 6.5%.

Since they don't want to raise taxes they will make up the debt in future budgets by cutting money from existing programs like Medicare and Social Security; two of the US's largest budgetary line items. This will be unpopular because these programs serve the US's large elderly (and typically Republican voting) population. When these cuts get brought up in conservative US media, they'll just bring up how Trump wanted to lower drug costs, but those socialist Europeans are stopping him with their negotiated drug prices. This won't be accurate, but its the story their voters will hear and most likely believe.

This war could be weakening SA. It cost the Kingdom around $5 billions every months and the Saud's power comes from their pocket. The more they spent men, gears and money, the more foreign States enjoy it. I am pretty sure this war, as horrible it is, is useful for virtually everyone involved. 

For Iran it is a war on SA's door step, for the Arab allies (Morocco, UAE, Egypt,...) they look good in the Saud's eyes and at the same time it may turn out tiresome for SA, the big wahhabit player everyone one more or less hate.

Here is the actual reasoning for their ruling: 

&gt;
The Court noted that those who choose to exercise the freedom to manifest their religion under Article 9 of the Convention could not expect to be exempt from criticism. They must tolerate and accept the denial by others of their religious beliefs. Only where expressions under Article 10 went beyond the limits of a critical denial, and certainly where they were likely to incite religious intolerance, might a State legitimately consider them to be incompatible with respect for the freedom of thought, conscience and religion and take proportionate restrictive measures. The Court observed also that the subject matter of the instant case was of a particularly sensitive nature, and that the (potential) effects of the impugned statements, to a certain degree, depended on the situation in the respective country where the statements were made, at the time and in the context they were made. Accordingly, it considered that the domestic authorities had a wide margin of appreciation in the instant case, as they were in a better position to evaluate which statements were likely to disturb the religious peace in their country.",,/r/europe/comments/9rm6n4/european_ruling_that_religious_feelings_trump/e8i71tu/,[deleted],1540579618

Putin's legacy in Russia is still seens as great, even after 4 years of sanctions, due to the leap the country made compared to Yeltzin.

I see, in a free society the proper way of debating is throwing a heap of insults on those with another view. In this case, me. Real nice, this society of yours, a bastion of free speech.

Looking beyond the mental assessments you're probably not qualified to give as someone working for a private company that produced some forecasts addressing the macroeconomic consequences of a Brexit vote, your objections are the following:

&gt; Elections and criminal law are all you need and want

Electing someone else doesn't erase the previous 4 years of mismanagement, and current politics suffer from an onslaught of demagoguery and irresponsible populism. So, yeah, the non-totalitarian regime needs to be improved.

&gt; criminalizing politicians for over-promising and/or under-delivering could be used to chill speech and shut up any politician.

Yes, politicians would need to self-censor their claims and promise only easily verifiable changes they're willing to bet their house on. Horribly totalitarian indeed. Is there any objective need for fiery speeches and overpromising? (A small digression: English is not my native language, so I might be in the wrong, but aren't over-promising and under-delivering defined in relation to each other, making the ""and/or"" illogical?)

&gt; Should we all be fired and pay fines, or your idea of ""accountability"" only applies to politicians?

That's up to your contract and contractors. In plenty of other fields, it happens. Accountability is not some bizzare new concept I invented, the accolades around it and your skeptic stance are unwarranted.

&gt; And who defines what a ""politician"" is - someone who's an elected official? How about someone who is, say, a party leader but hasn't been elected to any official position? How about someone like Lord Sugar? 

An official, wether elected or appointed. From my understanding, the latter covers Lords as well. If you accept an official position, you get some perks and should get some responsability as well.

The sea border would have been a compromise that would have been much easier to achieve if the DUP was not propping up this government and opposing it at every turn. You might be surprised at some of the inflexible or outdated things that are ignored in many constitutions or similar documents around the world to the benefit of most people. But I'm not familiar with the British constitution, maybe you can source that claim?

There is no rhetoric here, I was simply trying to say that it was an issue most people living near the border could have seen coming, it didn't materialise from thin air. But Westminster was unwilling or unable to give due consideration to N.I in all this. As a region, they voted against leaving with a majority, likely due to the proximity to any tensions or travel complications that may arise as a result of changes to the border.

And how could they have done that if they didn't have the support in the first place?

The point is that too many Germans just stood idly by when the Nazis seized power from their minority position. The fact that no German majority formed to prevent them from doing that is pretty clear evidence of rather widespread support or at least tolerance for what they were doing.

Claiming that small group of Nazis just seized power, without any support from the broader population whatsoever, is just naive and only serves to whitewash parts of German history.

&gt;&gt;The measure of productivity includes the profits.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Right, but it also includes costs. As it's gross product, rather than net (which is almost impossible to measure reasonably), high costs aren't factored in, so it could be that UK firms are as or more profitable than other companies, but with lower revenue and hence lower ""productivity"".

If the UK was just investing in high margin businesses, its productivity would be high. High margins means lots of added value. GVA should be pretty close to GDP as GDP is the sum of gross added values.

Secondly, we didn't take any of their land. Each country kept what they had. It's not our fault Bulgaria wanted to take a shot at Constantinople and got caught up in Thrace, instead of advancing west.

The wages in the article are gross though. A 700 euro wage for example  would become 600 net in Bulgaria. And the articles gives the average but most people get below the average as is mathematically inevitable. Same in Greece so if most people you know get 400-700 then the average is higher than that, Wikipedia for example lists Greece's average wage as 890 euros, numbeo - 700. So Bulgarian wages are still quit a bit lower   though prices help of course.      

Personally I think there's too much doom and gloom about Greece's economy. Did you know that Greece pay less debt interest as a percentage of GDP than America and a few European countries like I think Spain and Italy?  Greece has a lot of debt (to put it mildly) but it's loan conditions are fantastic.  So its growth prospects aren't too bad, plus it gets a lot of help from EU funds and the Juncker plan.

Ignoring the discussion above:
Did Greece make a formal complaint / statement during or shortly after the 4+2 negotiation about reparations?

Because while you might find the ""wrong timing"" argument insulting it has a validity. In the same way that if you would suddenly turn up in 2045 with a 2016 VW Diesel and demand compensation it wouldn't matter how well documented your case is it would still be ruled that by not directly speaking up when dieselgate actually hppened you implicitly waived your rights for compensation. If you however could prove that you did seek compensation in time and just were denied it that would be a different case.

So yeah, that ""wrong timing"" argument might sound morally disgusting to you, but it has some legal standing.

And while we are at legal nitpicking also note that the statement that further reparations were 

&gt; postponed until after Germany reunited

did at the time it was made actually refer to a complete reunification of all pre ww2 german territories and not just east germany. Because West Germany back then did neither recognize East Germany as a valid state nor the Oder-Neisse Border as the valid border between Germany and Poland.

If at some point this matter would really go to court Germany could argue that the conditions for this were never met and therefor the previously stated obligation for  further reparations are void.

Now none of this is of course argueing what would be morally right in this case.

But from a legal standpoint I don't think other states have really much of a case here, which is probably why they only ever bring those reparation issues up to fan domestic support but never legally follow through with them.",Hesse (Germany),/r/europe/comments/9rj5n3/ww2_deaths_by_percent_of_prewar_population_in/e8hhmv3/,ArtilleryAlwaysHelps,1540557717

5664,"What do you think that study says that in any way supports you, or contradicts me?

Trans people do not only require medical transition, that was a major point of my original post. That study completely reinforces my point.

&gt;Mortality from suicide was strikingly high among sex-reassigned persons, also after adjustment for prior psychiatric morbidity. In line with this, sex-reassigned persons were at increased risk for suicide attempts. Previous reports \[6\], \[8\], \[10\], \[11\] suggest that transsexualism is a strong risk factor for suicide, **also** after sex reassignment, and our long-term findings **support the need for continued psychiatric follow-up** for persons at risk to prevent this.  
&gt;  
&gt;Inpatient care for psychiatric disorders was significantly more common among sex-reassigned persons than among matched controls, both before and after sex reassignment. It is generally accepted that transsexuals have more psychiatric ill-health than the general population prior to the sex reassignment.\[18\], \[21\], \[22\], \[33\] It should therefore come as no surprise that studies have found high rates of depression,\[9\] and low quality of life\[16\], \[25\] **also after sex reassignment**. Notably, however, in this study the increased risk for psychiatric hospitalisation persisted even after adjusting for psychiatric hospitalisation prior to sex reassignment. This suggests that **even though sex reassignment alleviates gender dysphoria**, there is a **need to identify and treat co-occurring psychiatric morbidity in transsexual persons not only before but also after sex reassignment**.

They compared transgender people who underwent sex reassignment surgery to control groups of similar age. To support the idea that the surgery was a mistake, you would need a comparison between transgender people who underwent the surgery, and those who did not.

[The study I posted before](https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/ss/2013-v59-n1-ss0746/1017478ar/) had such a comparison, dealing with medical transition as a whole. See Table 3, which shows that of those studied who had attempted suicide in the last year, 27% were planning on transitioning but hadn't yet begun, 18% were actively transitioning, and just 1% had completed their transition. That's a significant decline.

You'll also see the same represented in ideation. Of those who had considered suicide in the prior year, 55% were planning but had not yet begun transition, 41% were in the process, and it drops to 23% for those who had completed transition.

If for some reason you've gotten the idea that I'm claiming that trans people need only transition and their mental health problems would evaporate, you've misunderstood me entirely. They need access to transition, but they also need social acceptance. This thread is about restrictions on transphobia, and that's exactly what I'm talking about.

The study also shows that quite clearly. Of those who attempted suicide in the prior year, 29% had been physically or sexually assaulted as a result of their being trans, 8% verbally harrased or threatened, and it drops to 4% who had experienced neither.

15% had no strong parental support for their gender, compared to just *2%* who did.

16% had low social support, 9% had medium, and just 2% had high social support.

22% had experienced high levels of transphobia, 10% medium, and just 6% low.

In other words, the best bet for a trans person is for them to transition, have supportive parents, have social support, and not be attacked or harassed. **Acceptance**.",,/r/europe/comments/9rauo0/switzerland_rules_transphobia_and_homophobia/e8hhpd0/,Antabaka,1540557791

The German government got flak by the Greek public for the harsh austerity measures imposed during the crisis. Did that stop them? No. Should Greece get away with it because the greek people would be displeased? 

&gt;Not to mention Greece itself doesn't have much international power to force reparations.

Agreed, but again, isn't it wrong if Greece is indeed legally owed money and it can't get it because it lacks the international power to force it? If anything it makes Germany look like a bully in a ""what are you going to do about it little Greece??"" way. 

Personally i'm in favor of this being settled in court once and for all. Realistically i have no hopes of seeing that money so i'm not bothered if we never receive it. What annoys me is the rhetoric from both sides with Greeks demanding the money and the Germans dismissing the whole thing while the situation is pending. If Germany is found to owe money, they should pay it regardless of the feelings of the German public. They're in a way better position to pay it it back than the Greek carrying the debt burden anyway. If it's decided that Greece is not owed anything, we can stfu about it for good. Either way i'd like to see this resolved.

&gt;If world would force Germany, then nothing good will come of it. Huge rise of populism

Okay but i don't see the same sympathy from the world when Greece is forced into austerity and there's unemployment that reaches a 25%. Are we only worried about Germany's feelings when ""unfavorable conditions"" are forced upon them?

A perfect man should know that sex with a nine year old will not always be accepted, but him doing it enshrines the practice in divine law (see:Quran 65:4)

- Actually Abu Bakr, A'isha‚Äôs father was not overly happy with the idea at first, it seems Muhammad wanted the marriage for himself for his own sexual ends. He had another wife who was still young but not as young as A‚Äôisha.

- We absolutely use it to dismiss his legacy for the reason I made in my first point. We are allowed to dismiss the brutal legacy of Genghis Kahn without fear of being charged, why is it different for Muhammad? Because it offends Muslims? Tough. Muslims need to realise that a society in which even their deepest feelings can be trodden upon, is the only society worth living in.

This is for the &gt;French Air Force and Navy, to face major conflicts. The current &gt;stocks would allow to make two or three years of intense wars, on &gt;the understanding that additional orders would be quickly sent to &gt;industrialists. The precision air-to-ground weapon fired by the &gt;Rafale, manufactured by the industrialist Sagem, is Modular Air-Ground Armament (AASM). It was ordered 744 copies in 2000, and the last deliveries of this first market are planned in 2011. The MP Fran√ßois Cornut-Gentille specifies in a report dated October 14, 2010: ""In 2009, the staffing target in AASM has gone from 3,000 to 2,348 units, including 1,200 with the laser kit. "" France will therefore buy less than expected, but its stocks allow it to continue its operations in Libya without difficulty. According to the report, the cost of this program is 846 million euros, which would put the AASM kit at more than 350,000 euros. It is expensive to destroy a kadhafist pickup that is worth 15 times less ...

&gt;The French also fired a limited number of SCALP-EG cruise missiles (a dozen). According to information from a parliamentary source, they currently have 500 of these machines, of which 400 must be renovated. Again, no problem of stocks for these precision weapons.

&gt;Finally, France has acquired in the United States, for these Super-Etendards and its Mirage 2000, dozens of Paveway kits, of different models. Mounted on smooth gravity bombs, they can turn them into precision weapons, and France has, for several years, this equipment. Point.fr said French planes had fired GBU-12 laser-guided bombs of 250 kilograms, GBU-24 bombs of 500 kilos, and that the Mirage 2000-D of the Air Force had fired GBU-49. This latest model is equipped with the Enhanced Paveway II guidance kit and France bought 200 copies in February 2008 for its Mirage 2000D.

&gt;What to conclude?

but: friends in onomastics and archaeology in a haze of beer would commonly debate origins of toponyms like esja which has no known nordic meaning, or vestmannaeyjar=west-men islands=irish islands (this has been interpreted as both a runaway √ær√¶ll hideout or an old hermitage) and whether certain christian items like caves with crosses in them are better classified as pre or post-landn√°ms√∂ld (age of incontrovertible nordic sentiment). so basically no real consensus from their fields, which are kinda more science-y.

all of these theories are supported by anectodal evidence in records, later ""histories"" and especially sagas. the intersection of historicity and narrative is what i studied (aka unemployment) and my take on it isnt too useful either. the saga of the faroes has some very similar stuff to the passages about hermits in iceland.

at various points the name ""thule"" was used in europe to refer to the faroes, iceland, and greenland. so the early records might get easily confused.

monks didnt always keep great records, its possible a scribe got confused about which island some earlier source was talking about and accidentally combined different histories.

OTOH the saga of the early history of svarfa√∞adalur is putatively historic but includes a decapitated zombie wielding his own head as a mace, which is great, but his name is ""Brekku-Klofi (klofi, which means cleft, from the ridge"" and he is associated with a farm called klofa-brekka (cleft ridge) and they're both named for each other. so what i'm saying there is they lied when they were bored or didnt have a good answer.

that being said there's massive speculation about irish and welsh voyagers following Merica, the western star, pre-clovis evidence of settlement with extremely primitive tools just around the last glacial maxim in north america in proximity to the mandan tribe who were rumored to be caucasoid, the norse probably made it to southern canada.

i'm skeptical as fuck, but i know if i say its impossible it will be proven factual tomorrow",Iceland,/r/europe/comments/9p7yol/most_common_country_origin_of_foreign_born/e8h5g0p/,throwawaybreaks,1540536601
