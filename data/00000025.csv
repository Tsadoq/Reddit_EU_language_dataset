4,"Is there any country without ANY corruption? I doubt it. Should they and other countries however move to the direction of battling corruption? Absolutely yes. However that doesn;t mean that they shouldnt do anything about their economy, development and investments until FIRST check the box that says ""we are done with corruption"".

You are talking about loans that should be paid off. HOW whould Italy, and any other country for that matter, pay them off if they are not doing investments, if they do not propose plans etc? Do you expect the money to just pour because they fixed their perscived corruption index?

You are also talking about a reason to invest. Assuming you are talking about lowering taxes, the only way for that to happen is by ensuring tax revenues from increased production &amp; trade. And thats why they are doing! Investing so they can have more revenues. Now, if we assume that you are talking about infastructure, thats again what they are doing!

Not only that, but Italy, like any other member state of the EU, HAS to take specific steps toward the directions agreed by the Comission and the Parliament - like you know, investments in Green Energy and transition and infastructure.

&gt;That's like literally every team in the top American leagues? ^^

The opposite. The are like 32 teams in the top leagues which have the same money to spend. Having wealthier owners doesn’t have any effect on the team’s performance 

&gt;Yes it's bad wealthy people can own clubs at all IMO - if it was forbidden for across the board I'm all for it. The point is that every team is already free to make it to the top, you don't have to negotiate access to a franchise system.

Why negotiate when it just requires money to buy all the top players?

&gt;That's a very American thing to say, and a bit rich considering American football isn't a thing outside the US, but I merely mentioned German football because you were wrong to assume clubs need owners at all. In Germany they usually own themselves. I demonstrated something, understand?

&gt;I guess you wanted to say competition. It's very one-sided and I love to hate Bayern with my guts, but it's still a competition yes.

"" Engelina Tareyeva, who worked with Navalny when he was a member of the liberal Yabloko party before he was expelled in 2007, has accused him of routinely using racial slurs and basing his relations with people on their ethnicity. ""I consider Aleksei Navalny the most dangerous man in Russia,"" Tareyeva has written. ""You don't have to be a genius to understand that the most horrific thing that could happen in our country would be the nationalists coming to power."" ""  
[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/07/is-aleksei-navalny-a-liberal-or-a-nationalist/278186/](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/07/is-aleksei-navalny-a-liberal-or-a-nationalist/278186/)  


"" For Navalny, it seems that the main problem with supporting the likes of Nicolas Maduro and Bashar al-Assad is material, not moral. Although he has derisively referred to Assad’s government as a “military junta” multiple times, its main crime in his eyes appears to be spending precious taxpayer rubles. ""  
"" In a controversial debate with former separatist commander Igor Girkin, Navalny described the war in eastern Ukraine as “an expensive thing.”  ""  
[https://carnegie.ru/commentary/76403](https://carnegie.ru/commentary/76403)  


"" 

In August 2008, Navalny advocated for a military solution to the conflict, thereby supporting Russia’s actions against Georgia:

*“In modern conditions, authority is based only on force and the ability to apply this force reasonably and where necessary. I am certain that now it is just ‘necessary’.”*

During the periods when the situations escalated, Navalny suggested providing military and financial help to South Ossetia and Abkhazia, declaring South Ossetia a no-fly zone, and immediately shooting down all aircraft appearing in that zone. He also suggested blocking Georgia completely, stopping any communication with them and expelling all Georgian nationals from Russia.

196,"&gt;US President Joe Biden is expected to formally recognize the massacre of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire during World War One as an act of genocide, sources said on Wednesday, a move likely to infuriate Turkey and further strain already frayed ties between the two NATO allies.

&gt;The move would be largely symbolic but would mean breaking away from decades of carefully calibrated language from the White House and come at a time when Ankara and Washington are already at loggerheads over a string of issues.

&gt;Biden is likely going to use the word “genocide” as part of a statement on April 24 when annual commemorations for the victims are held around the world, three sources familiar with the matter said.

&gt;“My understanding is that he took the decision and will use the word genocide in his statement on Saturday,” said a source familiar with the matter. Sources cautioned that given the importance of bilateral ties with Turkey, Biden may still choose not to use the term at the last minute.

&gt;White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday told reporters the White House would likely have “more to say” about the issue on Saturday, but declined to elaborate.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/mvyzms/biden_expected_to_recognize_massacre_of_armenians/gvf23mr/,Dimboi,1619073771

198,"&gt;When the British left the EU , Norway chose to downgrade the old EU quota by deducting Britain's historic fishing. The remaining EU member states thus received a new cod quota in the Svalbard zone of 17,885 tonnes, while the United Kingdom received a quota of 5,500 tonnes.

&gt;It was rejected by the EU, which responded in January by allocating itself a much larger quota of 28,431 tonnes.

Norway logically subtracts Britain's quota from the EU's total upon Britain's exit and for some reason the EU feels entitled to not only Britain's quota but then took it upon itself to add an extra 5000 tons. Makes sense...

The sixers tanked for 3 years. 2 of those years were really bad and the tank was longer than planned because of Embiid and Simmons missing a combined 3 season because of injuries. 

Fans also don't have to watch a tanking team. I personally an actually a sixers fan and did watch and can say, ironically enough, those tanking seasons were some of my favorite as a sixer fan. The basketball was terrible but only true fans paid attention during those times and it was cool to see players who weren't good enough for the nba get an opportunity and try to work their way into being true nba players. 

I'm not disagreeing with you really. Tanking is a bet negative overall but relegation just can't work for the big pro leagues in the US. There's no infrastructure, fan culture, other leagues or talent pool to support it.

The former president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker does not seem too bothered by the EU's miserable growth rate during his time in office, its geopolitical marginalisation, or indeed the growing power of corporate lobbyists in Brussels. But there is one thing that makes him at least a little sad. Not deploying the formidable force of his personality to swing the British referendum behind staying in the EU.

In an interview this week, Juncker revealed that David Cameron told him to keep out of the campaign. As in so many other ways, Juncker now reckons the former PM's judgement was a couple of bottles short of a full case. Juncker argues that if he had been allowed to make the case he could have explained everything the EU does for its citizens, the importance of the single market, and the value of its social model, and prevented the British from being 'brainwashed' into voting to leave.

Really? It is slightly hard to believe. The thought of the former prime minister of Luxembourg hitting the stumps in Sunderland, or shaking hands in Southend, is amusing. The heckling would have made for great viewing on YouTube. And yet when it comes to changing minds it would not have made any difference. The multi-millionaire businessmen fronting the Remain campaign often seemed remote and out of touch but they were fire breathing populists compared with the machine politician from Brussels.

Of course, Juncker could have won it for Remain if he had genuinely wanted to. If he had granted any meaningful reforms to the UK, offered an opt out on the free movement of labour, and allowed a two-speed Europe in which the UK was essentially an associate member, the vote would probably have turned out differently. But that would have meant abandoning the EU's centralising mission, and that is the one reform Juncker was never prepared to contemplate.

Juncker's comments simply reveal a larger truth. The Brussels elite still doesn't get why the UK decided to leave. It comforts itself with myths of lies and betrayals to avoid assessing its own flaws or thinking about how it might need to change. Still, at least if the French or the Italians ever get a chance to vote on their membership of the EU we now know that Juncker will be out there on the hustings, an enthusiastic Ursula von der Leyen at his side, making the case for the union.

268,"I respect your attitude, but I do disagree. I think it’s productive, at least for the US.


Americans aren’t very sophisticated because the US is a former colony founded by normal people (aristocrats don’t tend to emigrate). Over the years (going back to the 1800s), Americans have always had a chip on their shoulder compared to Europeans because the US doesn’t have fancy types of cheese or because American culture is less sophisticated. 

But at the end of the day, Americans don’t really have a reason to feel insecure because the US is a pretty serious country. Like, it’s hard to feel that insecure for your country’s status when your country has had a higher GDP per capita since than the UK since the 1890s and your country invented alternating current, the airplane, nuclear weapons, the transistor, first landed on the moon, the internet, etc.... We can’t be that bad or else we wouldn’t be the country we are today. Countries don’t generally become rich by being stupid and poorly run.


However, at the same time, the chip on the shoulder vis-A-vis Europe gives the US an incentive to accomplish more. The worst thing to do would be to be complacent and rot from within like the Roman Empire or whatever. But it’s good to always feel like you have something to prove. If American GDP per capita fell below Germany or the UK, then I would freak out and feel like a failure of a country and demand changes because that’s the expectation I have in my mind (obviously it’s different comparing oneself to smaller countries which might have disproportional oil or banking industries, or might be composed of just dense urban areas).",,/r/europe/comments/mro86r/the_us_compared_to_european_countries_according/gvetbv8/,Selobius,1619066843

Those systems are limited by geographicaly constraints, but there are already examples available, providing price-tags in the region they found necessary to be competitive with nuclear power.

488,"This is really simplifying the whole ""platform vs publisher"" debate. 

If a company like Twitter enforces the rules against one group of people, but not another, then that is a problem, no? Shouldn't rules be uniform? 

That also doesn't address the issue of large social media websites using pretext to shut down subreddits or individual voices when it fits their liking. 

I think there is a healthy discussion to be made with the role of social media in relation to freedom of speech. After all, no one is forcing you to use Twitter. Why is it a problem even if Twitter admitted to enforcing the rules selectively? Even if they admitted they outright censor those that don't share their ideology? They are a private entity and have the right to do that, don't they? Well. Maybe. That's where the discussion should lead. 

But certainly as a practical matter, no one is creating their own online infrastructure to voice their opinion, and the few that herald themselves as free speech platforms, Gabb or Parler for instance, get taken off the app stores.

The only times teams really play like jokes or not try hard is in the case of like the eagles where it’s the last game of the season and they had an absolute trash season losing the majority of their games. There’s always something to play for because there’s a playoff hunt and bracket seating in the post-season games for the super bowl contenders 

&gt;You can regard the result of this either way - as a nicely competitive league, or alternatively as a league full of mediocre teams.

&gt;Admittedly me saying the latter was a little tongue-in-cheek, but you can't deny that there is some truth to that. ;)

They would keep their heads down and would kindly downplay these issues and focus on trade and other things. In the recent months there's been a complete u-turn on this issue. Chinese foreign minister in his last visit in Alaska brought up racial issues in US, police murders of Blacks and rising anti-Asian sentiment. This is a seismic shift. Normally they wouldn't even think about bringing up this issues.

Secondly, I believe due to their rising manufacturing prowess and monopoly on certain industries and products, China wants certain countries to bow down to them economically. I believe EU falls under this category along with Australia and NZ. In Australia's case I love PM Morrison's approach. He didn't follow suit and kept criticizing them anyway. For instance NZ took a completely different approach and they are pretty much hush hush on China especially human rights violations. We will see how EU reacts. But I have no doubt they want to push EU into NZ territory, not criticizing China, not backing any global declarations...etc. Just focus on trade and shut up.

586,"&gt;No political-diplomatical help to cover separatism? 

As seen, the Finnish government didn't like what was going on (civil guard weaponry being smuggled to East Karelians by Finnish activists):
&gt;On 6 January 1921, an aide of the Finnish minister of foreign affairs Rudolf Holsti demanded an official account for the weapons. Eventually, the leader of the Repola irredentists, Bobi Sivén, received a letter from the Finnish foreign ministry stating: ""Due to extraordinary circumstances you must do your utmost to prevent the people of Repola and Porajärvi from arming themselves.""

&gt;The uprising is a peculiarity among heimosodat as this time the initiative was not taken by Finnish insurgents, but by East Karelian separatists, and Finnish government remaining officially passive. After the treaty of Tartu and Finnish government retreating from covert separatist support, the uprising was started by East Karelians, with Finnish volunteers joining afterwards

What is the source for your citations? I couldn't find it by search.

Also, considering the Soviet Union claimed to be a voluntary union of willing peoples, it's very curious that (prior to the Treaty of Tartu though, so irrelevant as for the post-treaty clashes) the assembly of the Olonets Governorate (which was Russian-majority, both the Governorate itself and the assembly) unanimously voted for secession from Soviet Russia, which was prevented by the Red Army. Doesn't look like voluntary participation for me.

&gt;what events in finnish history do you consider as wrongdoings?

There are certainly some, like the use of Imperial Russian jurisdiction in the trials of the red rebels in 1918, so that death penalty for treason could be sentenced on field tribunals (the Finnish jurisdiction would require review of every case of death penalty by the courts of appeal before the penalty could be carried out).

The other is the state of malnutrition in the prison camps in 1941-1942, even though Finland was in famine until the harvest of 1942 and the situation wasn't more than barely adequate until the harvest of 1943, the death rates were still unnecessarily high (though, no higher than that of Finns in Soviet custody - the reasons also being the same, hunger and generally poor conditions).",Finland,/r/europe/comments/mtwute/would_you_fight_for_your_country/gvdmtnk/,J0h1F,1619044146

But just because a new submarine cable has been put down, doesn't instantly mean that you or anyone in Europe will suddenly have better connection to Southern America. The cables are usually privately owned, and unless your ISP has a good reason to pay to use the cable, then there is no reason they would if another path is cheaper. What you need to understand here is that the internet works as autonomous systems(AS). Every ISP that has IP addresses needs to have an AS number assigned by their local internet registry, in Europe that would be RIPE. Each of these ISPs decide for themselves how they want to interconnect to others, if they even want to.

I found [this](http://ulfstein.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ChurchillUlfstein20101.pdf) paper about the treaty:

article 2:

&gt; Paragraph  1  provides  that  “\[s\]hips  and  nationals  of  all  the  High  Contracting  Parties  shall  enjoy  equally  the  rights  of  fishing  and  hunting  in  the  territories  specified  in  Article  1  and  in  their  territorial  waters.”  Thus, all parties have an equal right to fish in Svalbard’s territorial sea

and article 5:

&gt; Norway  shall  be  free  to  maintain,  take  or  decree  suitable  measures  to  ensure  the  preservation  and,  if  necessary,  the  reconstitution of the fauna and flora of the said regions \[i.e. the islands  referred  to  in  Article  1\],  and  their  territorial  waters;  it  being  clearly  understood  that  these  measures  shall  always  be  applied  equally  to  the  nationals  of  all  the  High  Contracting  Parties (emphasis added). 

And I guess the problem is that the EU does not find their share ""fair"" as written in article 2 when in comparison with the other nations involved and that they are discriminated against. (Not saying they are right, just stating the argument) While Norway probably argue it is fair and the reduced fishing is in line with article 5.

Also in regards to the area the treaty covers, Norway seems to argue that not the entire exclusive economic zone of Svalbard is covered due to the writing of this part (same article) 

&gt; We turn now to fishing and the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources  of  the  seabed  in  the  maritime  zones  of  Svalbard  beyond  the  territorial  sea. This matter is not dealt with, at least explicitly, in the Svalbard Treaty for the very  good  reason  that  international  law  did  not  recognise  any  maritime  zone  beyond   the   territorial   sea,   except   possibly   for   a   zone   resembling   today’s   contiguous  zone,32  at  the  time  that  the  Svalbard  Treaty  was  concluded  in  1920.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/mvjofs/eu_clash_with_norway_over_fishing_rights_around/gvd5b6g/,bjorten,1619036325

646,"&gt; I mean what you are doing is a strawman argument, no one wants to put  all busses and trucks on rails and set the limit to 50 kp/h since that  would just not work for obvious reasons. But simply putting up new speed  limits is easily doable. 

So it's about ""easy"" now?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; 130kp/h might be an arbitrary number but when putting up limits you  gotta decide for one. I'm not an expert and cant tell you if 90 is  better than 130 or what arguments speak for or against a number here but  I guess us germans would accept 130 quicker than 90 so its not that bad  to go with a number with the best consensus. The point is: a speed  limit has a lot of positive effects, looking at climate and security and  you cant deny that. 

So it's about being German?  


&gt; You wanted to discuss logically, wasnt your position against speed  limits? I think youre getting a little emotional about this topic, the  exact thing you critizised in your first comment!

I said not fully free because it's common practice in Romania to pay bribes to the doctors, nurses, anyone you can in the hospital to take you ahead of others. Even when people want to get hired as doctors or nurses they bribe the hospital officials to get a better job (many times they're not even allowed to get hired without a bribe).

What's worse is that doctors here earn thousands of euros per month (I think up to 3000€ is the norm for a doctor with years of experience), yet they happily accept bribes from patients and many of them are very arrogant towards people in general, since they see themselves as better than most society because of their salaries/jobs.

Also, many of the doctors working in public hospitals also have their own private medical offices, either that or they also have jobs as doctors at private hospitals. And often times when people come to get treated at public hospitals where it's supposed to be free, they're told to go to that doctor's private medical office/the private hospital he's working in, for a radiography for example. So you end up paying money as well, besides those from your taxes for healthcare.

I haven't paid any bribe so far to any doctor/nurse, nor will I ever do that. Unfortunately most Romanians seem to be happy to pay bribes to get ahead of others on the queues.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/mvm520/how_does_your_countrys_healthcare_system_work/gvd6c2t/,George97o,1619036768

So, maybe you could help me out becoming a better person, and clear up my biases? An explanation on how new nuclear power could offer a viable path to reach the 2030 climate goals in europe would help me a lot along that path.

&gt;The UK, France and Sweden are utilizing both renewables and nuclear and are much better at decarbonizing.

How many nuclear power plants have gone online there over the past 20 years? My understanding is that carbon emission declines europe in this century was not due to increased nuclear power production, but due to other means.

Are you saying that phasing out nuclear power before phasing out fossil fuels is your grievance? I guess, we can agree on that then.

&gt;trying to block other countries within Europe from utilizing nuclear

786,"I am very much for a european framework of defense. But as you said, it needs to have a strategy which it currently lacks. Every member state, even though spending the assigned 2%, usually buys the same duplicate equipment as any other state already has. This means we never get to the 'expensive stuff'. Europe lacks everything from cyber, drones, long range bombers, soon even hypersonic missiles

In regards to drones, Germany was blocking the project of Eurodrones several times citing it considers the technology unethical. I'm afraid this won't stop other cointries from using it, nor it will prevent the paradigm change that we've seen already in place in Karabakh conflict. It's here and if we don't act, we'll easily fall far behind in terms of capabilities and technology.

Looking into the future, countries will have to adopt this technology anyway if their defense should mean sth., so avoiding it only inflicts more pain to the already obsolete European defense. Without German participation, EU can only dream of next level tech like hypersonic or space, which all major powers will get into in no time. 

In my view, Germany cannot escape the responsibility of dealing with the topic of military by sticking its head in the sand. As it was mistake to use military to attack others, it is a mistake not to be ready to defend them in the future. And as we've seen, Russia and China speak only the language of power.

&gt;  the anti-revisionism of WW2 history steadily taking progress under the western umbrella

can you give me an example of that in execution or link me to an article that showcases/discusses this?


&gt; anti color revolutions or at least having equal right for such game where we could grow our own grassroots and put them in direct competition against yours.

I get where you are coming from, but this is an example of a policy or applying a form of political action.

Values would be:

* as examples of Western Values: rationalism, self-criticism, the separation of church and state, the rule of law, equality before the law, freedom of conscience and expression, human rights, liberal democracy

* or the old ""Prussian Virtues"", which are more of a form of personal virtues that over time morphed into Prussian (later generally German) national values by being held in such high regard. among them you find: austerity, discipline, [originally only religious] tolerance, punctuality, reliability, industriousness, incorruptibility, justice

Would you say there is a set of such universal virtues/values that Russia/the Russian people endorse, but which are fundamentally different from the broader Western Values? If yes, which are those? That is my initial question. The article I read claims that is not the case, as does for example [this 2018 russian arcticle from republic.ru](https://republic.ru/posts/89871)","Heil über dir, Hammonia!",/r/europe/comments/mvg9pw/putin_vows_russia_will_always_uphold_its/gvc7v39/,Wandsethal,1619022165

More and more, but for what purpose, to grow old or for energy?

Trees in this way only for IKEA. Atom, sun, water and wind, it is better to plan forests that will age and help purify water and air and create stable animal habitats. Such ""brilliant ideas"" are easy money in someone's pocket, return on investment will be even faster than that of wind and solar power plants. In Eastern Europe, laws and regulations will be easily circumvented, and this is being done now, and then a ""technical"" forest will be legally planned in place of the strata forest. In the same way, in some form, the ""biomass"" of the jungle is imported.

The populations are sort of reversed in relation to the languages. 

In Finland, most people have Finnish as their first language, although there is a minority population that have Swedish as their first language.

In Ireland, most people have English as their first language, while there is a population who speak Irish (Gaeilge?). 

About 1.5% of the Irish population report being daily users and about 37% say they're somewhat proficient. 

Of the Finnish population about 5.2% are Swedish speakers (4.9% without Åland). 

Finland was under Swedish and Russian rule for a long time, but we never just took on their languages. Maybe we're stubborn or stupid, or maybe English was actually useful for the population of Ireland, whereas Swedish or Russian didn't really help trade from Finland to enough extent.

But that's a new thing, under discussion, isn't it? I read [an interview](https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/interview/mep-canfin-the-french-hard-line-on-nuclear-is-a-dead-end/) on that recently:

&gt;First things first. Let’s look at the proposal that will come out of the European Commission on April 21.

A proposal that's to be provided by the Commission today. It is hardly something that explains non-adoption of nuclear power in other EU countries due to German pressure over the past decade.

&gt;Germany is lobbying hard to make natural gas eligible and nuclear ineligible under the taxonomy.

Yes, I agree that adding natural gas to the taxonomy is wrong, but I also don't think that nuclear power should be included, nor should biomass.

&gt;Most Germans I meet on reddit would prefer to fry the earth as long as we get rid of nuclear.

My impression is that this is a gross misrepresentation, or misunderstanding. My perception is that most people agree on climate change being important in europe, and the polling of greens on such a high level, pretty much confirms that. There also have been massive protests against coal in Germany. The disagreement is on the pathway to achieve the decarbonization.

I, for example, don't think that nuclear is an option that provides an effective way to mitigate climate change. It is way too slow, especially in Europe. Just look at the nuclear power sites under construction now. How realistic is it that any new planning and constructing would be done by the end of the decade? There may be an argument for prolonged operation of existing nuclear power plants, but I don't see, how building new ones will help to reach 2030 climate targets.

&gt;Their opposition to nuclear is stronger than their concern for the environment.

On the other hand there are a lot of people around here, that seem to be so strongly tied up to nuclear power as the sole magical solution to carbon-free energy production, that they disregard any downsides of the technology as baseless an blame its failures completely on opposing popular opinion.

1029,"&gt; No, I am looking at the rate, because speed is essential. You said yourself that nuclear was not deployed to reduce emissions, and looking at it globally, it appears like it never displaced fossil fuels in the electricity production. I am not convinced it would be easier to significantly change the rate of nuclear power deployments than to speed up the adoption rate for renewables.

If speed is essential, then nuclear/hydro has everything else beat, and it is not even close: 

https://imgur.com/a/8Ifzx39

&gt; I am also not saying that there shouldn't be any dispatchable electricity providers, I am just doubtful that nuclear is the only solution, and I am doubtful that it can play a major role in displacing fossil fuels in the timeframe we are looking at. To me current trends look like renewables are the most effective strategy to displace fossil fuels. Why shouldn't we try to embolden and strengthen that?

Why should we put all our eggs in one basket when **empirical evidence** shows there are other methods that have achieved **faster** deployment?

&gt; OK, thanks for the elaboration. What I don't understand is the point about storage. If you get zero or negative prices in low-demand, high-production times, wouldn't that be an incentive for storage systems, that could pick up the electricity at mininal prices and sell it again at higher prices? If you are able to combine the variable source with a storage system before putting electricity on the grid, you could avoid selling electricity at low prices, so there is an incentive for that aswell.

&gt; Would you say that the RethinkX analysis and projection is mistaken?

This is elaborated here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-021-00796-8

and here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435119303009

Because round trip efficiency, capital costs, charge efficiency, discharge efficiency all matters, regardless of the power cost. And we are not even close to having a cost-competitive technology ready at scale this decade, and likely not even the next.

&gt; Would you say that the RethinkX analysis and projection is mistaken?

They fail to mention that the exact same thing happens to VREs as well - lower capacity factors will happen due to increased buildout. In fact, it might even affect VREs the most, because their energy value is essentially 0 in an overbuild-scenario. It doesn't matter if energy costs are low, if the energy **value** it brings is also low.

&gt;One that came out of nowhere

&gt;Status: 19.04.2021 11:11 Uhr

&gt;Annalena Baerbock's rise has been rapid. The fact that the Greens operate so harmoniously today is also to her credit. But sometimes she lacks looseness - and something else is missing from the first Green candidate for chancellor.

&gt;By Sabine Henkel, ARD Capital Studio

&gt;Rarely has a politician risen to the top so quickly. Annalena Baerbock started actively at the age of 25, has been promoting Green ideas in the Bundestag for eight years and became party chairwoman at 37. Former Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said of her, ""Annalena comes out of nowhere for me."" 

&gt;From nothing to the very top, to the head of the Green Party - when she was elected, she made it unmistakably clear that she didn't just want to be the woman at Robert Habeck's side. Habeck had already made a name for himself by then, but she had hardly attracted any attention in national politics. That changed quickly. Today, she is regarded as a specialist politician, well-versed in many topics, works in a concentrated and focused manner, almost obsessed with detail. 

&gt;No staging

&gt;She can probably quote from the coal phase-out law in her sleep. Staging, on the other hand, is far from her mind, unlike Habeck. She doesn't like to be photographed. Baerbock comes across as authentic and is also recognized by her political opponents.

&gt;For example, with Thomas de Maizière in 2017 during the Jamaica negotiations, as he tells in the podcast of the ""Time"". ""This woman impresses me. I experienced Ms. Baerbock during the exploratory negotiations and there she made a very good impression, very informed, to the point.""

&gt;Jeans, T-shirt, leather jacket, on other days dress and high heels. Dynamic, self-confident. Sometimes, however, she lacks looseness, and above all, she lacks one thing: government experience. The woman who wants to get to the top has never governed. The political competition never misses an opportunity to emphasize this. That bounces off Baerbock, and it doesn't matter to the Greens anyway.
Team player Baerbock

&gt;Baerbock has a lot of support in her own ranks - now more than Habeck. Both are team players who have united the Greens - while the CDU/CSU is working on its self-destruction, the Greens are picking sunflowers.

&gt;Baerbock has played a decisive role in ensuring that the party comes across so smoothly, despite her double burden as a politician and mother. ""I have two small children and I don't want to stop being a mother just because I'm a top politician. And there will be moments when I'm not there, because it's more important then that I'm with my children.""

&gt;Children and the chancellorship - can that be reconciled? The head of government in New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, is setting an example. Baerbock doesn't give the impression that she doubts it. She sees it as the task of politics to improve the compatibility of family and career - even in top-level politics. A young mother in the chancellor's office can also push family policy and related social issues - be a role model.

&gt;""I don't believe in talking everything up and saying it's all easy to manage, such a round-the-clock job and small children,"" Baerbock explains. ""And I'm lucky that my husband takes a lot off my plate."" Her daughter once asked her if women can actually take parental leave. 

&gt;Double somersault forward into the chancellorship?

&gt;Baerbock lives in Potsdam, 40 kilometers from Berlin. She is friends with Habeck, she says, and is convinced that they can only run the election campaign together. A team player, that's what she brings with her from sports.

&gt;Baerbock played soccer and jumped on a trampoline - at a competitive level. She was even on the verge of winning the German championship until an injury stopped her. Her favorite jump is the double somersault forward with half a twist. This requires a strong will and courage. Somehow typical for Baerbock.",Schleswig-Holstein (Germany),/r/europe/comments/muuwew/germany_for_the_first_time_the_green_party_would/gvb3j9g/,imliterallydyinghere,1619000200

1116,"Setting aside the fact that Russia's military spending when accounting for PPP is actually the fourth highest in the world, this idea that so many journalists and politicians have that Europe's total defence budget is much larger and so therefore we are well protected is idiotic and dangerous.

Europe's militaries are mainly fragmented, only NATO, the Nordic Defence Cooperation and the Lancaster House treaties provide any real joint-military framework for coordinated actions. In the face of a hypothetical direct invasion from out of Ukraine, Belarus or Pskov for example, countries like Poland or the Baltic states would find themselves essentially alone for at least a couple weeks before a US led NATO could be fully mobilised, especially in the case of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia who would likely be cut off due to the Suwalki gap.

Just because Russia doesn't have the capability to role into Berlin before an effective response is coordinated doesn't mean it isn't a threat.

1149,"&gt; I.e. Ricarda Lang the ""Representative of Woman"" of the Party.

And what did she say?

&gt; Because it should not be normal as it is f.e. very unhealthy

That wasn't my question. Why should society, i.e. you, shame people for it?

&gt; Your ""scientific evidence"" doesn't show a single source. The article claims that a doctor claims that Studies show that exposure to weight bias leads to increased weight gain. But there are no studies references nor any real numbers named. Only ""Studys show"" ... which studies? Don't know.

Those claims are based on studies you can find on the right. For example, take this review:

&gt; Obese individuals are highly stigmatized and face multiple forms of prejudice and discrimination because of their weight ((1),(2)). The prevalence of weight discrimination in the United States has increased by 66% over the past decade ((3)), and is comparable to rates of racial discrimination, especially among women ((4)). Weight bias translates into inequities in employment settings, health‐care facilities, and educational institutions, often due to widespread negative stereotypes that overweight and obese persons are lazy, unmotivated, lacking in self‐discipline, less competent, noncompliant, and sloppy ((2),(5),(6),(7)). These stereotypes are prevalent and are rarely challenged in Western society, leaving overweight and obese persons vulnerable to social injustice, unfair treatment, and impaired quality of life as a result of substantial disadvantages and stigma. 

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/oby.2008.636

There is plenty of research on this topic and it all points into the same direction. 

&gt; Also it is quite obvious that abolishing stuff like ""being overweight is bad and not appealing"" certainly won't help with the overweight-problem in our country.

Why are you talking about how appealing being overweight is? It is totally irrelevant. Are you concerned that you won't find women attractive anymore if they all become overweight because they are not being shamed anymore?

&gt; Quite the contradiction don't you think?

You know what I think because I just told you. The question is: What do *you* think? Explain your argument.

If gay people get the right to marry are they getting an advantage over non-gay people? 

&gt; It is an advantage. But in the case of different age groups it would still be much more justified than in the case of different genders. 

Why? Again: Explain your argument. 

&gt; Evidence would be me and a few people that I know.

That is not evidence. Just because you were ok with being shamed doesn't mean everyone else is. 

&gt; A person usually needs a motivation when it comes to losing fat. If there is literally none because it is viewed as normal, then why should this person lose fat?

""literally none""? If you cannot shame people then you cannot even imagine another way? How odd.

&gt; Also one example where ""shaming"" had worked is smoking (of course not the sole reason here). Since we went from ""Smoking is cool and totally not unhealthy"" to ""Smoking is bad"" the Amount of Smokers has dropped too. 1973 more than 60% of all germans between the age of 18 and 25 smoked. Nowadays the number is close to 24%.

""of course not the sole reason here"". Unless when it comes to being overweight where there's literally no option when you take out shaming, as you just said. 

You're forgetting that being overweight is not always a result of personal choices but can be due to genetic factors. You can chose to not start smoking but you cannot just choose being not overweight. You're being reductive and superficial to make it look like the campaigns against smoking are the same as shaming people for being overweight.

&gt; Ricarda Lang had a rant some time ago about a woman that ""shamed"" her child for wanting to eat another cookie

Did she?

&gt; ""Your phrase"" . You are aware of the fact that about 4 Million refugees are waiting in Turkey and that in 15/16 about 1,45 Million Refugees arrived in Germany? 

And what party is constantly complaining about that? 

&gt; Take a look at the ""Freie Wähler"" or the ""CSU""(which is of course linked to the CDU ... a party which did let this happen) for instance. Both of them are also against a European State.

Freie Wähler do not talk about millions of immigrants. They talk about rules. That's why I said ""your phrase"" because it is the revealing part. They also want a stronger EU with Frontex and more cooperation. They also want to reduce the gender pay gap. They also want to support shelters for women but isn't giving that them at advantage over men?",,/r/europe/comments/muuwew/germany_for_the_first_time_the_green_party_would/gvb40ab/,Prosthemadera,1619000616

1151,"They're isolating themselves at an astonishing rate. 

Compare their support among their 'countrymen' compared to nationalist support in Ireland. 

Bar a few loud and unpleasant Presbyterians in Scotland who may have family links to the Scots Irish in Northern Ireland, almost nobody in the United Kingdom supports with or agrees with Northern Ireland's unionists. They're viewed as pitiable anachronisms and wannabes pining for a past that never existed, or as backwater imposters who are about as British as Xi Jinping. 

Their heady blend of religious fundamentalism, laughable ignorance, non-stop anger, sectarianism, regressivism, and their unassailable dedication to the exploits of a Dutchman who only cared about their distant ancestors tangentially, if at all, puts them at odds with other UK subjects. 

Even though the vast majority in the Republic detest the IRA and their equally fucked-up campaigns of sectarian violence and terrorism, there is in Ireland broad sympathy for the nationalist cause and general support for the idea of a United Ireland. 

Nobody wants the Unionists. Not the UK, and certainly not Ireland. This isn't a sectarian thing south of the border. Not only would the Republic of Ireland and some of the most important elements of being a modern Irish person not exist without Protestants who fought for our independence and culture, but religion is increasingly a minor concern across the rest of the island. It's barely even political. It's societal. Who wants to claim a diminishing, bitter population of snarling, ignorant chavs?

1300,"For those who favor a less dramatic, but more realistic account:

&gt;While there have been discoveries of archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from approximately 14,000 years ago, the dense layer of much younger debris obscures Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites. Evidence of stone tools, pottery, and stone weapons attest to about 10,000 years of human presence. Several excavations support the view that Rome grew from pastoral settlements on the Palatine Hill built above the area of the future Roman Forum. Between the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age, each hill between the sea and the Capitol was topped by a village (on the Capitol Hill, a village is attested since the end of the 14th century BC). However, none of them yet had an urban quality. Nowadays, there is a wide consensus that the city developed gradually through the aggregation (""synoecism"") of several villages around the largest one, placed above the Palatine. This aggregation was facilitated by the increase of agricultural productivity above the subsistence level, which also allowed the establishment of secondary and tertiary activities. These, in turn, boosted the development of trade with the Greek colonies of southern Italy (mainly Ischia and Cumae). These developments, which according to archaeological evidence took place during the mid-eighth century BC, can be considered as the ""birth"" of the city. Despite recent excavations at the Palatine hill, the view that Rome was founded deliberately in the middle of the eighth century BC, as the legend of Romulus suggests, remains a fringe hypothesis.

1319,"&gt; It shows that nuclear power was, as you said, not employed to reduce carbon emissions.

No sources were deployed with the goal to reduce carbon emissions back then. Not hydro, not nuclear, and not wind/solar - because it wasn't on the agenda. 

&gt; If the goal is to reduce carbon emissions, it thus, appears to me the best strategy to strengthen and speed up this trend. Betting on nuclear to achieve this on a global scale instead, appears much more risky to me. Maybe the reasons for non-adoption of nuclear to discplace coal over the last 30 years was political, maybe it was economical, maybe it was technological, probably a combination of all of these. In any case these obstacles would need to be overcome, which appears to be a slower process than resolving the hurdles that need to be overcome for the adoption of renewables.

This is a contradictory statement. As of yet, we have **not seen** variable renewables being able to ""fully"" reduce carbon emissions at scale, at all. Every country that has low CO2e/KWh(emissions related to climate change) either have large parts of hydro, or nuclear. Not a single country has been able to decarbonize with wind/solar alone. Using your logic, shouldn't nuclear be the **only** reasonable option, as it is the only non-hydro low carbon power source that have actually reduced emissions at scale? I'm not saying we should go all hydro/nuclear, but I'm using it as an example of how ridiculous that logic is.

&gt; OK, but if nuclear is used in combination with a large share of variable renewables, wouldn't that result in operating them as dispatchable sources that are run as needed? So you may only get small capacity factors for those plants, and thus higher levelized costs, due to the large capitalization costs.

This applies to renewables as well. If you overbuild wind/solar so you can meet demand all the time, then the the LCOE of each wind/solar farm soars through the roof, because most of your electricity will be sold at 0, or even negative prices. Currently, wind/solar farms get paid even if they do not supply electricity. This is in contrast with dispatchable power that does not have this benefit. However, this cost is shouldered by the consumers, and not the utilities. With an increase in variable production this will have to change, making VREs less valuable. This is why storage has to become incredibly cheap for 100% VRE to be a viable strategy.

In such a scenario, we have to change from ""economic dispatch"" to demand dispatch on the merit order - at least if we want to achieve lowest possible costs for the consumer(or, total system costs as we call it). As it stands now, the consumers are carrying the cost of the inflexibility of wind/solar. This is cheap for the utility with current ruling(economic dispatch), and is currently cheaper for the consumer as well(because there is dispatchable backup/baseload available), but will be more expensive for the consumers once you approach high VRE penetration.",,/r/europe/comments/mt78xh/air_pollution_from_europes_coal_plants/gvaok2i/,Exajoules,1618986177

1486,"Some other background that's helpful:

* The SPD is very old--probably the oldest of the currently active parties in Germany. It dates back to the early 20th Century, I believe. It's the traditional old guard, labour movement adjacent, socialist left. At the Federal level, it's the only left leaning party that has ever led a government. The last time ended pathetically in 2005.

The Greens were coalition partners to the government that so pathetically ended in 2005. Joschka Fischer was Foreign Minister, which is basically #2 in German government. And he is a treasure. 
* The Left formed as a merger between the Party of Democratic Socialism, which was the successor to the East German Communist Party and a bunch of anti-labour-reform socialists who left the SPD after the Hartz IV labour reform.

1517,"&gt; A decorated enlisted soldier in WW I, gassed and blinded during the war, aimless and forgotten, living in flophouses after the war.

Not flophouses. They were accommodations for bachelors that offered decent conditions, in-house amenities, etc. Those were relatively affordable (but not cheap), and were not homeless shelters.

He worked for the German Army after the war, spying on subversive elements (and becoming one of them in the process), until he decided to go Nazi full time.

&gt; Not taken seriously at all as he started his career in politics. An outsider, lower class (though not low class),

Son of an Austrian public servant, grew up with staff doing his chores. He collected his father's pension, which allowed him to live without any notion of work while developing himself artistically in Vienna. His mommy paid for his education and failed exams. That's not lower class. That's a modern hipster.

&gt; Then he united huge parts of the greater German population and avenged Germany's most horrible and humiliating defeat in history.

Murdered most of Jewish population, destroyed Poland into oblivion, massacred Belorussians, danced in Paris, etc. It seems to me that a large portion of his goals have been accomplished. Just few years after the war, Germany with umbilical cords plugged in to US treasury and USSR resources, with industry largely intact, was doing just peachy. If you consider it a humiliating defeat, imagine how glorious must have been Soviet occupation for those that ""won"".

1565,"The split in the Conservative party was nearly 50:50, not exactly being dragged kicking and screaming. By virtue of being Conservative, the party recognises that sometimes it needs to ally itself with the progressives to achieve incremental and organic changes, but it's doing so purely to achieve objectives rooted in Conservative ideology. Honestly, if you'd given the party another 5 years the Conservatives would've won the vote outright. Again, you're making a lot of a 9 vote difference which doesn't really stand to reason. It's a weak argument.   


"" If you really believe that gay marriage was a good policy decision, it seems to me that you cannot escape the conclusion that either progressivism (which wanted this change) is superior to conservatism (which didn't want it)""  


No? Progressivism isn't superior, it often leaves things of value by the wayside in it's desire to progress. I come from an NHS family for instance and one of the great sticking points of the older nurses in my family was getting rid of the matron, a policy which turned out to be disastrous and caused a huge amount of costs both operational and financial. Due to a progressivist desire to modernise and remove ""archaic"" elements of the institution they actively made the service worse, and once removed those elements couldn't be restored. Like the dodo, once the matron was extinct it couldn't be revived.   


""or at the very least that conservatism will refrain from making positive (incremental) changes without progressive voices in the conversation - meaning that conservatism needs progressives to properly function.   


Where did I argue that there was no need for progressive voices in parliament? If you have a group of conservatives in a room (I have some experience with university conservative politics) you'll naturally find a smattering of positions; the forward thinking conservatives, the backward thinking conservatives and the fence sitting conservatives. Conservatism draws it's strength from consulting all of these groups, and delivering policies which offer progress which develops upon tradition. Having critical progressivist voices outside the party offering up legitimate critique is very useful, it helps highlight areas of weakness. The Conservative party wouldn't have built the welfare state in the 1940s-50s, however now it's at the core of most of the Conservative party and any attempt to dismantle it would be met at utter defeat at the polls.",,/r/europe/comments/mtp9bu/tories_accused_of_corruption_and_nhs/gva6opq/,BoyW1thADragonTattoo,1618973878

While I’m not aware of any exit polling in the 2016 election studying this phenomenon, here’s a study from Florida in 2000, often referred to as a prime case of the “spoiler effect”. I’ll copy the abstract below. https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/lewis/pdf/greenreform9.pdf

“The 2000 presidential race included two major party candidates—Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore—and two prominent third party candidates—Ralph Nader of the Green Party and Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party. While it is often presumed that Nader spoiled the 2000 election for Gore by siphoning away votes that would have been cast for him in the absence of a Nader candidacy, we show that this presumption is rather misleading. While Nader voters in 2000 were somewhat pro-Democrat and Buchanan voters correspondingly pro-Republican, both types of voters were surprisingly close to being partisan centrists. Indeed, we show that at least 40% of Nader voters in the key state of Florida would have voted for Bush, as opposed to Gore, had they turned out in a Nader-less election. The other 60% did indeed spoil the 2000 presidential elec- tion for Gore but only because of highly idiosyncratic circumstances, namely, Florida’s extreme closeness. Our results are based on studying over 46 million vote choices cast on approximately three million ballots from across Florida in 2000. More generally, the results demonstrate how bal- lot studies are capable of illuminating aspects of third party presidential voters that are otherwise beyond scrutiny.”",,/r/europe/comments/muuwew/germany_for_the_first_time_the_green_party_would/gv9s8wh/,NerdyRedneck45,1618966234

Yes, you need. Since we're better than academically in almost everything, we are also better than France when it comes to college. We got 17/20 best colleges in Top 20 universities in the world. France got 0. You are saying Germany can't invade us because we have Atlantic ocean in middle but Atlantic ocean is still in the middle, when we invaded Germany, didn't we? If we can invade Germany while being Atlantic ocean being there, why can't they do same? Lmaoooo. Does Atlantic Ocean disappear when we invaded Germany? Someone needs to get into Harvard to learn about geography.

&gt;That is some next level brain gymnastic. So if I understand correctly, your goal in Vietnam was to lost 58,000 men and left? What a wonderful goal.

Yes, we killed almost 1,6 million Vietnamese while 58,000 American soldiers. Who won the war? Their country was dropped more bombs than Germany in WW2. While our country didn't even get 1 bomb from Vietnam. Who won the war? We bombed their country for 20 years straight. We didn't surrendered like you surrendered to Germany. By the way, we did same in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. We bombed their country too. 

&gt;So the win is accomplished by who lost the less men and who get money? Germany casualty: 5.5 to 6.9 million. French casualty: 567 600French win. Who get the money? France got 2.8 billion throu Marshall plan it paid back 225 million. French win. US paid billion and billion for years in military. France didn't even paid 2% of its gdp for 43 years. French win. Please continue to send free money, much appreciated. 

Yes, thats how it works. Germany gave those casualties because of United States of America and USSR. France didn't do that. If France did that, you wouldn't have surrendered to Germany, would you? It's our accomplishment, not yours. USSR and USA split the Berlin in half, not France lmao. So, yes you need to thank us for invading Germany since **you surrendered to Germany**. We won the WW2 against Germany, you didn't. We shared the Berlin with USSR for almost 50 years, not you. *You lost the war when you surrendered to Germany in 22 June 1940*. So, you should thank us for saving you. If you defended your country and not lose to Germany without us, you could have been winner too but you lost the war. If Germany lost that many people, it's because of us and USSR. Because without us, France has lost the their country to Germany. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France

As you can see, you lost the war, until American soldiers came into Normandy. We beat Germans, not you. If you could have won against Germany, you wouldn't have surrendered your country to Germany and beat them yourself. Did you do that? **NOPE, you surrendered like a weak nation.**

&gt; Yeah the purpose was to have a communist government in Vietnam, sure. Big win indeed.

We bombed them for 20 years, 15,000 miles away from home. We killed 1,6 million Vietnamese vs 58,000 American soldiers. They never came to Washington DC to bomb us but we bombed the shit out of Vietnam and destroyed their country, just like Afghanistan and Iraq. If Vietnamese one day comes to Washington DC and we surrendered to Vietnamese, you can talk about that lol. That won't happen though. We aint France, we will never cry to French to save us from Vietnamese and you cried to us to save you from Germany lol.

I think the biggest reason that people in Germany disslike Die Linke is that

- Many parts of the party vehemently refuse to call the GDR an Unrechtstaat. 


Naturally that doesn't sit well with many Germans. And that's why I think that Die Linke won't be able to be a part of the reigning coalition if they can't overcome their horrible past.

1984,"British whistleblower Jonathan Taylor was briefly placed in a psychiatric hospital by Croatian police on Monday night. Taylor was a lawyer at the Dutch multinational SBM Offshore for ten years and his actions revealed a huge bribery affair in 2012. Monaco is seeking his extradition. He has now been detained in Croatia for 265 days.

Why is this important? The European Whistleblower Directive was introduced in 2019. It says people like Jonathan Taylor should be protected from retaliation from their former employers. Taylor's fates show that, despite the European directive, this does not end up in practice.

What happened? Taylor issued a written statement last Friday explaining that he suffers from depression and suicidal tendencies. He did so at the request of the British Ambassador and Consul, with a view to an upcoming hearing at the Croatian Supreme Court. He explicitly asked that the information be shared only with the Croatian Supreme Court in the hope of gaining movement in his case.

But despite that request, the information ended up with the police. On Monday night, two officers showed up at his door to take him to a hospital. Taylor refused and a scuffle ensued and he was pushed to the ground. Strapped to the stretcher, the whistleblower was taken away and then tied to a bed again with hands and feet.

When he refused him unfamiliar medication, he was forcibly given an injection of sedatives twice. Meanwhile, Taylor is free again. He is furious about the attitude of the British Embassy, he NU.nl. ""Instead of helping me, they turn me over to the Croatian police and give me the worst 24 hours of my life.""

What about the bribery affair at SBM Offshore? Jonathan Taylor worked as a corporate lawyer at SBM Offshore for ten years. When a massive kickback affair came to light, Taylor worked hard for those responsible to be dealt with.

When he did not believe that was the matter, he cooperated with European, American and Brazilian investigative services, after which, among other things, a former CEO Tony Mace was sentenced to three years in prison in the US and the company reached a settlement of 240 million dollars (about 199 million euros) in the Netherlands.

Why is Taylor in Croatia? When he went on holiday with his family in July last year, he was arrested. Monaco had issued an arrest warrant with Interpol. For many years, the principality was the location of SBM Offshore. In hindsight, this turned out to be unjustified because no prosecution had yet been brought against Taylor, let alone that he had already been convicted.

He was released on bail after five days. His family returned to Britain, he was left behind in Croatia. In recent months, Taylor has found themselves in a legal maze, with croatian courts moving the ball together. Neither Monaco nor SBM Offshore took steps to free him from his plight.

Who's helping Taylor? In August last year, the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom called on Monaco to drop the charges against Taylor. ""This is yet another attempt by SBM Offshore to abuse legal tools to intimidate and silence Taylor,"" the statement said.

In October 2020, Pieter Omtzigt, in addition to being a Member of parliament, also whistleblower reporter of the Council of Europe, announced that he felt that Monaco was ""abusing"" its power. ""The relentless prosecution of a successful whistleblower like Taylor must be stopped,"" he said in a statement.

The British Government was reserved during a debate in November last year. There was no evidence link between Taylor's activity as a whistleblower and his arrest, according to the deputy foreign minister. Taylor reacted with bewilderment. ""I have been abandoned by my own government,"" he told the BBC.

Another hearing on Taylor's case is scheduled for Tuesday in croatia's supreme court. The British Embassy in Zagreb did not respond to questions from NU.nl.",Koninkrijk der Nederlanden,/r/europe/comments/muwutw/sbmwhistleblower_forcefully_transported_to/gv8c936/,GloinGleckal,1618943104

1986,"The 400 year night is a myth. Some of the most known ""Dano-Norwegians"" from that period of time were born in Norway (meaning they had the means to rise high in power and status).

 from wiki:
Although the Dano–Norwegian union was generally viewed favourably in Norway at the time of its dissolution in 1814, some 19th century Norwegian writers disparaged the union as a ""400-year night."" Historians describe the idea of a ""400-year night"" as a myth that was created as a rhetorical device in the struggle against the Swedish–Norwegian union, inspired by 19th century national romanticist ideas. Since the late 19th century the Danish–Norwegian union was increasingly viewed in a more nuanced and favourable light in Norway with a stronger focus on empirical research, and historians have highlighted that the Norwegian economy thrived and that Norway was one of the world's wealthiest countries during the entire period of real union with Denmark. Historians have also pointed out that Norway was a separate state, with its own army, legal system and other institutions, with significant autonomy in its internal affairs, and that it was primarily governed by a local elite of civil servants who identified as Norwegian, albeit in the name of the Danish King. Norwegians were also well represented in the military, civil service and business elites of Denmark–Norway, and in the administration of the colonies in the Caribbean and elsewhere. Norway benefited militarily from the combined strength of Denmark–Norway in the wars with Sweden and economically from its trade relationship with Denmark in which Norwegian industry enjoyed a legal monopoly in Denmark while Denmark supplied Norway with agricultural products.

In short the police didn't believe her and after quite a few minutes of the girl begging them to help her, they finally realized the situation was real but the secret services( the only ones with the necessary resources) couldn't track her phone because of a law politicians passed in order to protect themselves.

2108,"Because it seeks to conserve a core set of values through change. Progressivists take issue with a set of social ills which they see as stifling progress towards a specific goal (such as huge income inequality) whereas conservatives take the organicist view that you're not attempting to get to a specific goal and (to use Oakeshott's analogy) you're just trying to keep the boat afloat. Conservatives do not take issue with income inequality for example, they want to preserve property rights, however they will move to curb income inequality if it starts to become a source of social disorder.   


If we take political reform in the late 1700s for example, where Conservatism emerges, we can see the divergence clearly. The progressive cause wanted to remove the monarchy and aristocracy to create a new republican government. However, to the conservative this policy is extreme and dangerous; they grasp the benefits of some form of continuity and would suggest marginalising the role of the king and establishing a parliamentary system to enable representation without totally removing the stabilising structure of monarchy. Likewise, in the UK the Conservative Party moved to (successfully) legalise gay marriage; this is because they could see that the institution of marriage is (in their view) beneficial to society. Therefore society would benefit from access to marriage being distributed as widely as possible. Likewise, in changing the Queen's title of ""defender of the faith"" to ""defender of the faiths"" they recognised the ideological value of keeping the monarchy attached to religion but removing toning down some of the explicit Anglicanism.

&gt;No, they are not. The USSR was a hostile imperialistic dictatorship trying to install its own rule in Afghanistan when it invaded the country. The US simply supported South Vietnam and defended it from being taken over by the communists in the north

Facepalm, im talking about major power loosing a war to a smaller/weak nation which had support and used guerilla tactics. The comparison went over your head. We are talking military here. Another good examole of these types of comparisons is when people refer Peninsula War as Napoleon's Vietnam, same premise happened there too. 

And South Vietnam was a dictatorship, because US never cared about democracy. US would rather support genocide just to spite the Soviets.

&gt;The people who compare these conflicts refer to the fact that both wars lasted for very long and the two superpowers both lost these wars

Same with attitudes towards homosexuality, Austria like we see is closer to the west than the east for example. Other factors such as whether national identity is linked to ethnicity also puts Austria closer to the west with 50% of Austrians saying its not important to be ethnically Austrian to be considered Austrian whereas this figure in Hungary is is 90%.

The Iranian airliner was flying over the gulf during a military skirmish between Iranian gunboats and an American helicopter and then a US destroyer- the destroyer crew did try to contact the aircraft multiple times over civilian frequencies and after failing to respond it was believed to be an Iranian F-14 on an attack run. 

Investigators determined that it was likely that differences in instrumentation regarding flight speed meant that the Iranian pilots in 655 probably assumed the destroyer was trying to contact a different aircraft (there was an Iran maritime patrol aircraft nearby), so that was why they didn’t respond.

The idea that it was Iranian reinforcements after the failure to respond to hails made sense, the destroyer had come to help the helicopter so the Iranians had sent an F-14 to help their gunboats. The thought process was that the Iranians weren’t amateurs, they weren’t going to pick a fight without having reinforcements of their own ready.

That is from the second panel of psychiatrists which I am reading from the court report right now. 

"" Yes, Mr. Z ... suffers from a chronic psychotic disorder, presumably of a schizophrenic nature, following an inaugural acute delusional episode (what classical psychiatry called a “Primary delusional experience”). He also suffers from a long-standing addiction to cannabis and of a pre-morbid pathological personality of the antisocial type ""

It's a good thing they did had a third panel.

"" The offense charged against the subject **cannot be linked to a mental pathology chronic**; but appears in direct connection with an acute delusional puff of exotoxic origin.

They go on further 

""**The subject is curable and readjustable.**
To date, he accepts the continuation of treatment, but these will have to be extended, for a period of several years, to be able to hope for curability or readaptability. Mr Z ... did not appear convinced, during the expert interview, of the absolute necessity of the total interruption and final consumption of hashish""

It seems they think he can re-adjust but the only barrier is the fact that Mr. Traoré isn't convinced he needs to stop consuming cannabis.

They even conclude 

""- the clinical diagnosis, at the time of the facts; in this case that of a sharp delusional puff of **exotoxic origin**.""

**Turkey: main destination for EU’s waste exports**

Turkey is the largest destination for waste exported from the EU, with a volume of around 13.7 million tonnes in 2020 - more than three times as much as in 2004. The second largest destination was India, which received almost 2.9 million tonnes of waste from the EU in 2020, followed by the United Kingdom (1.8 million tonnes), Switzerland (1.6 million tonnes), Norway (1.5 million tonnes), Indonesia and Pakistan (both 1.4 million tonnes).

In recent years, Pakistan has markedly grown as a destination for EU waste, with volumes increasing from 0.1 million tonnes in 2004 to 1.4 million tonnes in 2020. In sharp contrast, EU exports of waste to China have fallen from a peak of 10.1 million tonnes in 2009 to 0.6 million tonnes in 2020.

**Ferrous metals waste accounts for half of all waste exports from the EU**

In 2020, exports of ferrous metals waste (iron and steel) from the EU amounted to 17.4 million tonnes, accounting for more than half (53%) of all waste exports. The main destination was Turkey; with 11.8 million tonnes, Turkey received more than two thirds (68%) of the ferrous metal waste exported from the EU. Moreover, the EU imported 4.1 million tonnes of ferrous metal waste, with almost a third (32%) coming from the United Kingdom.

Although at a far lower level, considerable amounts of paper waste were also exported from the EU. The 6.1 million tonnes exported accounted for close to one fifth (19%) of the EU’s waste exports in 2020. 1.6 million tonnes (26%) of this were destined for India, 1.2 million tonnes (20%) for Indonesia and 0.9 million tonnes (15%) for Turkey. However, there were also 2.2 million tonnes of paper waste imported to the EU, with the largest amount (0.9 million tonnes, or 41%) arriving from the United Kingdom.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/muitr4/where_does_eu_waste_go_turkey_is_the_largest/gv62tg0/,filosoful,1618893818

Based on what? What the majority of people wear? I wont listen to Taylor Swift just because she has millions of fans. The whole point is that the dress code is completely unnecesary, it serves no purpose. Him wearing sneakers is just what is normal for a 21st century human. It's just a shoe. It doesn't matter how it looks like. 

&gt;Appearances are key in politics. You don’t want the people you’re negotiating an important deal with to think “you don’t care”. Wearing whatever you feel like sends exactly that message. This is basic concept, but I’m not surprised redditors with no social awareness can’t pick up on it.

No social awareness? You are the one bootlicking an elitist fress code. Normalize dressing normal ffs. It's nothing suspicious about not dressing as other people. Appearances are key? Based on what? Yeah most people wear dresses in politics but it's just such a shit way of showing your personal capital. We dont need that, it serves no purpose. Not dressing strictly by the dress code does not come across as 'you dont care'. Of course he cares he's a minister. And im sure when he is governing the medical system no one gives a fuck what shoes he wears. In the end, people support professionalism and results.

2906,"""Much better"" yeah uhhh...

Imagine that Hitler stayed alive and in charge for around 40 years more, purging every leftist, lgtb, femminist, intellectual elites and really any oppossing force (even inside his own regime) that he could found, indoctrinating the population into catholical-fascism during all those years with no oposition. That's what we got in Spain. Imagine what that could do to a country that was at the moment starving. I can't even figure out how the democratic transition even actually worked.

As for the fascist supporters, well nobody really got rid of them, they all either were slowly diying at old age or formed political parties (one of which is one of the two biggest parties in Spain to date, Partido Popular). There is a ""new"" one that is even openly xenophobic, misogynistic, etc, Vox. Falange (the fascist party that supported Franco at the time) is still a thing although is pretty much residual now.

So, well, I woudn't say exactly much better...  fascism has still an alarming number of supporters.",Extremadura (Spain),/r/europe/comments/mu0x9e/gay_lesbian_and_bisexual_people_should_have_the/gv4voov/,MrKnome,1618870697

2971,"&gt;The overly predatory gay that hunts every half decent men.

When I was in my last year of university one guys in our group asked us if someone wants to write an essay for him for money, because he doesn't have time to do that himself. I wanted to make a joke, you know, just a harmless banter (something guys supposedly do from time to time), so I told him that I can do that for him but I'm not interested in money and he can ""pay me in nature"" (you know what I meant). Over a few days he become very uncomfortable with me around, he stopped shaking my hand as a greeting (well, he stopped greeting me at all lol), I even confronted him after classes and told him that I'm sorry for what I said and I won't do that again.

Fast forward two days later, after classes, it appears that both me and him are going to the same shopping center. I just had a gut feeling that something's off and something bad is gonna happen. After four years of living in the city I knew the public transportation system and it seemed off when he changed the means of transportation too many times. I wanted to be nice, so I tried to chat with him about some usual, boring stuff, because that's better than nothing.

When we were in the metro, he suddenly jumped back to the station just before the train's doors closed, and he texted me telling me to fuck off him. You have no idea how awful I felt after that. I didn't want to make a scene, so I had to wait until I come home to burst out crying. Because he thought of me as a gay sexual predator. From that moment on I decided to never engage in anything friendly with other guys, because I can't risk being seen as a sexual predator anymore.

&gt;This idea to put gays in the same category as pedophiles is the same.

Yeah... It's just ridiculous. I for one am attracted only to men with very masculine traits, such as muscular body, thick body hair and a lot of it (must-have), who can grow thick facial hair (must-have). Most of the guys even in their early twenties don't look like that. That's why I always find it ridiculous when people think that gay men are pedophiles. Like what would I even want to do with a minor? I'm not even attracted to men who are muscular but completely hairless, there's something about that that turns me off.

No, but they are a product of their environment and their history, both of which are dominated almost entirely by Britain. Your country bears the responsibility for what Northern Ireland is today, there is no shying away from that.

&gt;annexed by the RoI

Reunified with the rest of Ireland*

Very strange way for you to describe that concept, seems like you have a motive to try and uphold...

&gt;It will cost you an incredible amount if you agree to take them on.
To give you an idea of the cost, the amount that the UK subsidises NI by is roughly fifty times what the EU spent in NI. 

I never denied it would be expensive, I denied your ridiculous assertion that the UK would just be walking away without any agreement to cover it's financial obligations to Northern Ireland. There will be a transition period and the UK will be sharing the bill. I'll again point out for posterity that it is entirely the fault of Britain that Northern Ireland is in the economic state that it's in, ethno-religious supremacism yielding to ethnic strife isn't good for economic growth.

&gt;expansionism

Yeah, you definitely have some sort of forlorn nostalgia for the British Empire or something if you're framing Irish reunification as ""expansionism"". I wonder if you think that West Germans' desire to reunify with East Germany was also just a ploy by fervent nationalists that want to expand.

3067,"&gt;In my experience young women have nothing against LGBT people, but a lot of young men feel visibly uncomfortable around openly gay people, maybe it's because of their fragile masculinity.

It's just insecurity in general in my experience. Women tent value social peace more than men do and are less outgoing with this stuff. I've had lesbian apprentice a few years ago and many women also got uncomfortable and weird around her too. A gay colleague told me that that is fairly normal. If they're married or have a partner it's usually not a problem, but if they're single women also often don't know how to deal with that and get awkward. 

&gt;I'm a simple guy, I mind my own business and I don't care how others live their lives, unless they decide to hurt others.

That the only right attitude. I get that people might have problems with these things, but it's simply none of their business how other people live their life.

3147,"&gt;The issue is that barely had the dust settled on that first referendum, the SNP were already calling for another by the 2017 elections (ironically this lost them seats).

Which is how it should work. The case for another referendum should be based on the support of a populace which is measured by elections of the parties that push for it/don't push for it, not on the decision of one person/party. This is how democracy works and balances itself out. 

In 2017 people didn't want another referendum so SNP lost seats. Now they are about to win the majority so it seems like something in the society has changed and the the referendum is once again something Scottish people want. Yes, it would necessitate another campaign where SNP will have to answer those questions about  borders, finances, currency, rejoining the EU, etc but if that's what the population votes for, this is what they vote for.

And also, SNP is a party whose current existence is based on promoting independence, so of course they would be calling for independence the minute after the lost the previous referendum, and they would be calling for one if the lose a hypothetical next one too. You wouldn't expect a leftist party to just abandon the leftist policies altogether and stop calling for them once they lose elections to a right wing party, would you?

And still a vast improvement over 40 years of commie rule, despite clearly not being the sharpest tool in the shed.

&gt;Do you have bipolar disorder?

I can value some aspects of ones activities, while disagree with other ones. He did the right thing, i.e. leading the anti-commie movement, and then another right thing happened to him, i.e. he became irrelevant politically after it turned out he's a bad politician.

And with all his simple-mindedness and being a bad politician, he was still by a few orders of magnitude better than commies in the position of power, given that by the end of his term in 1995 the transition to capitalism was already succesfully over, and we were already above the economic level we were on in the late 80s - some post-commie countries struggled for much longer with their transition. So at the very least he had better advisors than most other countries in a simar situation.

&gt;Hard to argue with someone whose view on world is limited with soft toilet paper.

Soft toiled paper is one out of thousands of basic consumer goods that are easily available in modern Poland, but were a treasure, or just plain unavailable in Soviet-occupied Poland. 

&gt;You can solve consumer goods crysis different ways - do you know that?

I'm very happy with the way we solved ours. During the last 30 years, we had one of the highest GDP per capita aggregate growth rates in the world, and before the pandemic it was going so well, I could literally feel visibly more well-off year to year.

&gt;who organized external pressure on Warsaw bloc economy during Cold War and Arms race, which in many ways caused this crysis of consumer goods,

I praise him, because those actions lead to the collapse of the eastern block, indeed. This was a great deed to the humanity, including all the peoples enslaved by communism.

&gt;at the same time pretend to be bothered about quality of life in 80s.

Consumer goods crisis in Poland started as soon as 1975-1976. And it would start even earlier, but for the few years prior to that the state amassed large amounts of debt in order to fill holes in supply left by its unsustainable shithole economy. Once nobody wanted to lend this shithole money sink anymore, the 1976 crysis started, and then it continued until its long overdue collapse finally came, and freed us from this sick Soviet experiment imposed on us.

&gt;Like what? What did they do what neonazis hadn't

Neonazis using openly neonazi symbolism were banned as well. Communist symbolism represents similar trauma to our nation, and warrants similar actions.

&gt;Then why do you cry about Warsaw bloc participation

It was involuntary. Membership in the NATO bloc starting from 1949 would be much more beneficial to Poland as a country, therefore being forced into a knockoff wersion of it by the occupying USSR, and in an inferior economic model we didn't chose in the first place is something worth being angry about. We lost 4 decades of normal development, and the enormous pace at which we've been making up for the lost time during the last 3 decades only makes it clear how much potential development has been lost in the 1944-1989 period due to the Soviet occupation.

&gt;Enemy of Poland?

&gt;Honestly, why do you think so?

Take a look at the last 400 years of history, and actions taken by Russia in this area. It's not that hard. Russia has always been the foremost enemy of Polish prosperity (briefly overtaken by Nazi Germany during WW2, but not without serious competition for the spot on USSR behalf).

&gt;There are other ways - like policy of neutrality, that Finland and Austria keeps.

As if we trust Russia enough to respect the policy of neutrality, lol.

We've all seen what happened in Ukraine, and earlier in Georgia. This is what happens to some of the Russian neighbors who think neutrality is a good idea.

&gt;Instead Poland played european puppet of USA role and started agressive rusophobic politics.

And rightfuly so. After being occupied by Russia for 45 years, with our economy in shambles due to Soviet-imposed restraints on economy, we had every right to be rusophobic, and would pursue such a policy either way. Luckily for us, USA don't like Russia either, so it was a perfect match.

&gt;alliance is good, because together countries are stronger.

&gt;But deeper intergration is bad because...?

Free trade is good, because strong economies are built on it, and we need all help to recover from the disastrous results of communism in our country.

Deeper integration is bad, because we didn't regain our independence in 1989 only to lose it again so soon.

Again, you are putting too much weight on the Soviet occupation in determining our culture.

Ofc they have, they are absolutely already the one country with the least in common to the rest... But much of our cultural identity was formed from the mid to late 1800 hundreds where we stopped fighting each other and started viewing ourselves as a cohesive whole, this started to include Finland when they became independent.

3310,"&gt;The European Union exercised its option for a further 100 million doses of Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine, raising its order from the companies to 600 million doses.  
&gt;  
&gt;The boost makes the EU deal the partners’ biggest yet, and they’ll aim to deliver all the doses this year, Sean Marett, BioNTech’s chief business and commercial officer, said in a statement. The option to buy an extra 100 million doses was part of a purchase agreement the 27-nation bloc signed with Pfizer and BioNTech in February.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech last week agreed to accelerate Covid vaccine deliveries to the EU by 25% this quarter, bringing forward shipment of 50 million doses that had originally been scheduled for the fourth quarter. The EU needs more shots from the U.S.-German alliance to offset challenges in the rollout of vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson &amp; Johnson.  
&gt;  
&gt;J&amp;J put its shipments on hold while regulators review rare cases of blood clots in a few people who got its shot.

While they strive to be objective though, they start with the *petitio principii* that atomic energy is a problem, but they don't waste time at stating how the problem manifest itself exactly. In that, they somehow fail to convey the difference in timescale of those two different topics that are too often amalgamated : climate change and depletion of natural resources.

Finally, while they do note that the worldwide appetite for energy is still growing rapidly, it would have maybe be helpful to link this with the even more fast growth of the human population, which is an aspect of those problem that, for some reason, is hardly ever discussed.

So certainly a very egotistical individual, but the idea he was out to get Collins is a fabrication.

He also wanted Collins in London in order to have a military presence at the negotiations, and spook the British government a bit. 

Also Michael Collins was very respected by the ardent republicans on the anti-Treaty side. There was a sense that he was one of them compared to political leaders like Griffith, and hope that he would come around to the anti-Treaty side, when they heard of his death in the midst of the Civil War, republican prisoners started praying for him.

I don't even like Wałęsa for that matter, and I'm glad that he fell out of politics in the mid 90s as he was a bad politician, but I will always have utmost respect towards his contribution towards freeing the country from the communist yoke.

&gt;By moving simple workers to power

Moving simple workers who have no idea how to run the country to power... uhm, wonder what could go wrong. Perhaps a country which used to be on the level on Spain could become a shithole where there are no basic consumer goods available!

&gt;What even communistic party

The Polish commie party existed for a few years, with their support in the 0.05% zone (quite deservingly so), and was tolerated until it started doing illegal shit.

&gt;Poor guys, now they have good toilet paper.

Well, some didn't live through 40s and 50s to tell the tale.

&gt;Lost sovereignity to USA/EU

We aren't big enough to be sovereign on our own, especially with such a dangerous, irrational and unoretictable country as Russia on our doorstep. I mean, we only stopped being occupied by USSR 30 years ago, lots of people are still alive who remember those grim times, and they don't want to ever let that happen again.

Russia is an enemy of USA as well, just like they are an enemy of Poland, so allying them immediately in 1990 (and formalizing the alliance through joining NATO in 1999) was only natural.

EU is an enormous economic bloc trade with whom is enormously beneficial to us, moreover most of its members are NATO members - thus already our allies - anyway, so joining it was also a natural decision, as much as its unhealthy attempts at ever increasing federalization need to be countered.

The financial Fair Play, in all its mildness, was nevertheless a brake to the crazy expense of a few clubs that are now in deep waters anyway. They want to keep on spending and on the other side bigger sources of money compared to the current ones.

Social media was buzzing with speculation after Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko said that he was going to announce a “principled” decision of the last quarter century this week on April 17.  

“In the near future, I made a decision, we will formalise it now, I will announce it. This will be one of my principal decisions for a quarter of a century of presidency. It will be very serious. Therefore, even if I am not there, in the popular saying, ""only through my corpse"" and so on, they will not succeed. I made a decision. Now I need to formalise it,” Lukashenko said in a statement published on the state run Pul Pervyi Telegram channel.  

Lukashenko also noted that, most likely, this decision will be made in the format of a decree.

However, the embattled president gave no details as to the nature of the upcoming announcement.  

The tease comes in a week where Russian President Vladimir Putin is also due to give his state of the nation address to the Russian people, providing the perfect opportunity for the Russian president to follow up with a similar announcement.  

Fuelling the speculation has been a series of high-level meetings between not only Putin and Lukashenko, but a series of visits by most of Russia’s cabinet over the last year since Lukashenko was re-elected in the disputed August 9 presidential election.  

Russia and Belarus prepared the groundwork for a merger with the Union State deal signed in 1999 that laid out the ground work for a ruble-zone like deal that would bring the two countries much closer together.  

Since then there has been a lot of unexplained to-ing and fro-ing between Moscow and Minsk by most of Russia’s Cabinet, starting with an announced trip by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and most of his Cabinet in September for talks, although no details on the subjects under discussion were given to journalists.  

In a warm up to this week’s announcement Lukashenko also announced that Russian security forces had successfully thwarted an assassination attempt on the president’s life and that of his son.",,/r/europe/comments/mtxp01/will_belarus_merge_with_russia_this_week/gv2ebl8/,quixotic_cynic,1618828111

In a warm up to this week’s announcement Lukashenko also announced that Russian security forces had successfully thwarted an assassination attempt on the president’s life and that of his son.

“Why am I not talking about it? Because it directly concerns me and my children. If you noticed, I often said: they will pump us, it will take a long time, they will not leave us behind, we still do not know much. Now we know more, but we do not know everything. But I assumed,” he said as cited by TUT.by.  

Lukashenko also noted that an attempt to organise a rebellion first, and then a ""creeping coup"" failed in Belarus.

Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) backed up Lukashenko comments saying it had arrested the Belarusian political scientist Alexander Feduta and the American lawyer of Belarusian origin Yuri Zenkovich in Moscow in connection with an alleged military coup in Belarus and attempt on Lukashenko’s life.  

“The Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, together with the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus, as a result of a special operation, suppressed the illegal activities of Yuri Leonidovich Zyankovich, who has dual citizenship of the United States and the Republic of Belarus, and Alexander Iosifovich Feduta, a citizen of the Republic of Belarus, who were planning a military coup in Belarus according to a well-developed scenario of “colour revolutions ” with the involvement of local and Ukrainian nationalists, as well as the physical elimination of President A. Lukashenko,"" the FSB said in a statement.  

“According to the anticipatory information received from the Belarusian partners, in the private chats of one of the internet messengers, the ideologues of the Belarusian radical opposition Zenkovich Y. and Feduta A. organised a discussion of the plan for an armed rebellion in Belarus and decided to hold a personal meeting in Moscow using the measures available to them conspiracy with the opposition-minded generals of the Armed Forces of the republic,” the release says.

“Upon Zenkovich's arrival in Moscow after consultations in the USA and Poland, the scheduled meeting took place in a separate office of one of the capital's restaurants. During the meeting, the conspirators told the “Belarusian generals” that for the successful implementation of their plan, it was necessary to physically eliminate practically the entire top leadership of the republic. They detailed a plan for a military coup, in particular, including the seizure of radio and television centres for broadcasting their appeal to the people, blocking in the capital of the republic units of internal troops and riot police loyal to the current government. A complete shutdown of the power system of Belarus was being prepared to hinder the actions of power and law enforcement agencies. It was assumed that some armed formations would begin the active phase (“partisans""), located on the so-called.

3592,"&gt;You find high approval because many people, like you, don't understand and don't try to understand the alternatives.

You're making assumptions again and you've got it wrong yet again. Perhaps try ditching your current biases?

&gt;They hear ""president"" and they think Trump or Putin.

That's an argument for why people would favour a monarch over a president, not for why people would be happy with a president they voted against.

&gt;I'm sorry, but my experience and the history of my country DO evidence how a non executive president can be accepted across the many divides of society and politics.

Your experience doesn't. Ireland does partly contribute, but given Ireland has had more single candidate president's than multiple candidate president's, it's sadly supports my point rather than your own.

&gt;If in the unlikely event of a pro-union president being elected (a ridiculous hypothesis, since by definition he or she would be a supporter of a republic) it would make little difference, as he or she has no power to promote or instigate political initiatives.

But no one's arguing he'd achieve anything, were arguing whether he'd represent the 48%.

A sports team could be ran by a democracy, some are, but being managed by a democracy would be in efficient.

&gt;I think I've detected the problem here, it's notbthya uou don't believe in democracy, you just don't understand it. That explains so much.

No, the problem here is you repeatedly keep arguing a point that's not being argued, and simply ignore everything I write. You're precisely the sort of person who'd storm the capital building if the other presidential candidate got in, because you're entirely in capable of breaking out of your own echo chamber to even give someone the bare respect of reading what they write.

“The oppositionists have chosen the day of the Victory Parade in Minsk on May 9 this year as the date of the military coup,” the FSB concluded.  

The FSB went on to explain that after documenting the meeting, the conspirators were detained and handed over to their Belarusian partners.

The Belarusian investigative authorities are investigating a criminal case on the grounds of a crime under Article 357 (conspiracy or other actions committed to seize the state authorities) of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus.

Conviction carries a maximum of the death penalty.  

Commenting on the plot Lukashenko said: “We discovered the work of clearly foreign intelligence services, most likely the Central Intelligence Agency, the FBI, I don’t know which of the Americans worked there. We discovered their desire to come to Minsk and start organising an attempt on the life of the president and children,” as cited naviny.online.  

On a personal note Lukashenko warned those who threaten his children with reprisals.  “God forbid they touch my children, who are not involved in this at all! God forbid, not only to mine, but also to yours! It will be, I’ll tell you frankly, it will be a terrible massacre,” the Belarusian president said.",,/r/europe/comments/mtxp01/will_belarus_merge_with_russia_this_week/gv2efeh/,quixotic_cynic,1618828203

Yulia, who traveled from Moscow to make a 3-4 day visit with her dad (and who would travel that far just to stay a couple of days?), was there to coordinate with the two couriers.

I'm sorry but that's simply reality. I'll repeat again, when you're fortunate enough to have the electorate voting almost unilaterally in favour of a single outcome, sure that single outcome will be supported by the majority. But when you're only allowed one outcome, and you have a divided vote, that outcome is simply a symbol of that division. The 48% who voted against the outcome are not inherently going to simply give up and change their minds.

3952,"&gt;They aren’t though

Who are not what? There are no vested interests fighting progress towards renewables?

&gt;the integration costs are making German electricity very expensive.

We arrived at low prices of generation only now. As far as I understand it, German electricity consuments are basically [paying the subsidies for expensive renewables over the past decade](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/industrial-power-prices-and-energiewende). How about prices in other EU countries with high shares of renewables?

&gt;Without very efficient very cheap storage we will be relying on gas to  fill in the low production periods for decades or centuries.

So it would be important to develop cheap storage systems, I'd say. However, the storage capacities and grid flexibility we have already seem to [allow for some expansion of renewables already](https://frontis-energy.com/2019/09/29/energy-storage-market-in-germany/):

&gt;Logic seems to indicate that with aggressive renewable energy targets, a  nuclear phase-out, and increased emphasis on energy independence  Germany will need to develop more EES capacity. However, many have  conjectured that the lagging expansion of EES in the short and medium  term will not pose a barrier to the Energiewende. In fact, some claim that EES will not be a necessity in the next 10-20 years. For example, even when Germany reaches its 2020 wind and solar targets (46 GW and 52  GW, respectively), these would generally not exceed 55 GW of supply and nearly all of this power will be consumed domestically in real-time. Thus, no significant support from EES would be required.

Energy storage may also get [cheap faster than expected](https://energypost.eu/grid-scale-battery-costs-are-declining-faster-than-wind-and-solar/):

&gt;Gas is struggling to compete with batteries, with gas prices globally being at historic lows.  
&gt;  
&gt;When gas prices recover, gas will not be able to compete. The cost deflation will ensure batteries pay a larger role in the power system at the expense of gas in the very short term.

I guess, we'll see. In the past decade though there was no large surge in electricity produced by gas, while renewables grew tremendously.",,/r/europe/comments/mt78xh/air_pollution_from_europes_coal_plants/gv1h1hq/,haraldkl,1618801411

4028,"I actually agree with most of what you said. I’ll just try to write my thoughts to each of the paragraphs. 

To 1. I didn’t know that Germany never paid reparations, and if they didn’t I’m sorry. I mean Czechoslovakia and especially Czechia was one of the first victims of Nazi Germany and lived under its regime the longest. And you have to know, the reparations towards the Sudeten Germans is just something I thought of because of the history of my family. Both of my maternal great-grandmothers were expelled from the East after WW2, and I know that the Sudeten German one always wanted to return to her “home” (she could actually speak in a dialect that, according to my mother was extremely hard to understand). The story of losing the house they worked for all their lives 2 years after they paid it off is something I find really sad, since I know that they didn’t have anything afterwards. They always thought they could return one day, that’s why they dug a hole and hid their stuff in a large pot. If nobody has found it yet, it might still be hidden underground (I even thought of trying to find it myself, but I have almost no clues and I think the Czech people would be mad if I turned up with a shovel, digging holes in their garden). And I agree with your statement that we should leave it be now, as most people responsible/ affected are dead now, and I think that nowadays Czechia doesn’t deny that what happened was terrible (and even organized a march to remember what happened)

To 2. I probably know less about the history of that region than you, so I don’t know everything about the history. Somewhere else on this post I also read that many supported Hitler and joined the nazi party, so I believe you. But I think many of them wanted to join Germany (iirc the Sudetenland tried to secede after the establishment of Czechoslovakia and join Austria, which was ignored by the government) that’s why they were attracted to the ultra-nationalist ruling party of Germany, which had the unification of all “German people” as one of it’s main goals. Of course that does not justify their actions, it’s just to understand why they turned to nazism easily. I mean they were a large minority (and in their regions a majority) that couldn’t choose their own path. I’d still agree that most supporters of Hitler, who believed in ideals should’ve been punished after the war. This could’ve been achieved with expulsions or imprisonments (especially since they probably weren’t put on trial in Germany, which sucks). But many were deported regardless of their political opinion and behavior during the war (which you also said). And I’m sorry for what happened to your family in the Sudetenland. This should of course happen to no one. 

To 3. You basically explained my opinion towards most “crimes” that happened to the German population during/ after WW2. I understand why they acted that way, but I think the actions aren’t justified, as there is no justification for acts like this. Deporting millions of people, entire ethnic groups (who lived there for centuries) and destroying their culture is never justified, but I understand why they did it. And like I said in an earlier comment, what happened to Czechoslovakia and Czechia during WW2 is probably worse than what they did to the Germans, and their hate towards the Germans was justified. It’s easy for me to condemn their actions nowadays when I didn’t experience what they did. 

And everything that happened back then isn’t the fault of today’s Czechia or Germany. I agree that we shouldn’t use what happened as a reason to hate on each other, but as a reason to show why war and authoritarianism is terrible, and why it’s better to be friends. War just creates bad people on both sides, and both sides will hate each other for what the other one did during the war. 

I’m sorry if I wrote to much or something incomprehensible, I’m tired and it’s 2:30 for both of us. I am actually supposed to study for an exam, and only wanted to take a “short break”, which ended up with me reading stuff about history and writing this long text.",Lower Saxony (Germany),/r/europe/comments/mta9xj/sudeten_germans_forced_to_walk_past_the_bodies_of/gv10ugy/,LarryLiam,1618792234

In England that is (or at least was) the philosophy. As the home of Football we are fortunate to have a large Football pyramid, with 92 professional teams and many more semi-professional and amateur sides (Who also have rich histories, like Corinthians). 

To support a team that you have no connection to and are simply famous/successful would quickly get you labelled a ""Glory supporter"". A good example of this is Manchester City, before the buyout they were overshadowed by Manchester United, but reassured themselves that ""Manchester is Blue"" and ""People from Manchester support City, people from outside Manchester support United"". This was very true, when I was growing up all the boys in my year supported Man U, Chelsea, Liverpool or Arsenal. It was myself and another boy (Man City fan) as the outsiders.

4057,"Hahaha I should also be sleeping, but this is one of the few topics that can keep me up on Reddit. Your post does make sense and contrasting to me, you view it from an obviously slightly different angle, which is accentuated by our ancestors' experience. I just find it wonderful that even after all that history, if people like us met in real life there would be no bad blood. Which is truly a miracle considering how recent the war was. It just shows that if a country deals with its past constructively and the other moves on after which they tie economies and reunite culture, any horrors of war mean very little.

Also regarding the history, I'll admit that I have done a lot of reading on the topic over the years, but it's so vast and complex that it's just hard to understand everything in a full light.

If you want to know the full history of Sudeten minority politics, look up the Sudetendeutsche Partei, (SdP) article on Wikipedia. The English version is quite nicely summarised there and it gives you the full picture on why the Czech side felt the need to deport back then. Namely the part where 88% of ethnic Germans in the country supported the party and 41% were full on members. It's honestly surprising how much support there was for Hitler in the region. But as you said, that can be largely explain due to the fact it's a minority with desire to have independence and self determination so it kind of makes sense.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/mta9xj/sudeten_germans_forced_to_walk_past_the_bodies_of/gv133je/,Paranoid_Honeybadger,1618793441

Mario Draghi is using his position as Italian prime minister to deliver the one thing he could never conjure up when he was head of the European Central Bank: massive fiscal stimulus.

In his first few months in office he’s already on track to run through over 70 billion euros ($84 billion) in support for the economy. Combined with stimulus measures passed by the previous government, that adds up to over 170 billion euros to protect the country’s families and businesses from the pandemic.

The government says that will push this year’s budget deficit to 11.8% of output the government says, making it the biggest stimulus effort in Europe.

Draghi is acting from the conviction that Europe’s economies will be stronger in the long run if fiscal and monetary authorities work together to jolt them back to health as soon as possible.

While that means running up massive debts in the short run, the alternative might be a cycle of half measures and anemic expansion that would leave Italy and the European Union lagging further and further behind the U.S. and China.

“Draghi himself has said it’s a wager,” said Veronica De Romanis, professor of European Economics at Rome’s Luiss University. “But it’s the only chance we have, the alternative is austerity.”

That all-in strategy is the most audacious manifestation yet of a sea change in fiscal philosophy in Europe since the austerity-driven response to the sovereign crisis a decade ago.",,/r/europe/comments/mtmw36/draghi_is_betting_the_house_with_europes_biggest/gv0lp8z/,quixotic_cynic,1618784389

Draghi’s determination to make growth as the lodestar of his policy cements Italy’s place alongside France in brushing off potential constraints on spending and taking advantage of the market’s willingness to underwrite economic recovery.

The extra spending will push Italian debt near to 160% of output this year, higher even than the 159.5% touched after the devastating impact of World War I. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that Italy’s economy will expand by 4.2% this year, faster than the euro-area average. But Draghi’s deficit plans are more aggressive than those of any of his European peers.

“Judged with the eyes of yesterday it would be very worrying. Today’s eyes are very different because the pandemic has made the creation of a great deal of debt legitimate,” Draghi said during a press conference in Rome on Friday. “Debt is good if you can put a company back on the market and allow it to support itself.”
Italy’s 10-year bond yields were at 0.747% on Friday after closing at a record low of 0.456% in February, while investors are still paying the French government to take their money for a decade.

With European fiscal rules suspended until 2022, the door is wide open for countries that want to provide large-scale stimulus and Italy is due to get more help when about 200 billion euros in European recovery funds starts to come through later this year.

While disputes within Poland’s governing coalition have threatened to delay the ratification of the plan, European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said Friday that the EU is in “the final stage” of preparations for releasing the funds, although a handful of countries still have work to do.",,/r/europe/comments/mtmw36/draghi_is_betting_the_house_with_europes_biggest/gv0lseo/,quixotic_cynic,1618784434

“For a vast majority of member states plans are in advanced stages,” he said at a press conference in Brussels after talks with EU finance ministers.

Draghi made a name for himself when he was head of the European Central Bank with the famous pledge to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro, signaling to markets that he was ready to push monetary policy to its limits.

**The U.S. Example**

Convinced that the region faced the threat of deflation, Draghi steered the ECB onto a stimulus path encompassing multiple unconventional tools from negative interest rates to quantitative easing that were previously considered unconscionable in the context of the euro zone, not least amid German dissent.

Draghi’s taboo-busting approach took its cue from the Federal Reserve in Washington but left the euro area riven by disagreements by the time he left the ECB in late 2019.

He had pushed through his final round of bond purchases over the public opposition of central bankers from Germany, France and the Netherlands, leaving scars that his successor, Christine Lagarde, is still tending to.

While he was driving the monetary policy engine at the ECB, Draghi at times voiced his frustration that governments weren’t doing more with fiscal policy to support demand.

Now that he has control of the fiscal levers in the EU’s third-biggest economy, he’s helping to drive the bloc more into line with a push across the advanced world to prioritize extraordinary stimulus as the central response by governments to an exceptional economic crisis.",,/r/europe/comments/mtmw36/draghi_is_betting_the_house_with_europes_biggest/gv0lvwp/,quixotic_cynic,1618784483

In the U.S., that approach has been reinvigorated this year with direct payments to citizens authorized since the onset of President Joe Biden’s administration.

As he presented his plans for another round of borrowing on Friday, one reporter asked him if he didn’t feel that another 40 billion euros was going too far. The prime minister’s answer suggested having embraced his fiscal gamble, he’s going all in.

“I don’t think if, instead of being 40, it had been 30 you would not have had the shivers,” he said. And then he added, “Growth is the key criterion: it must be sustainable growth.”",,/r/europe/comments/mtmw36/draghi_is_betting_the_house_with_europes_biggest/gv0lxm2/,quixotic_cynic,1618784506

4339,"Yes, it is theoretically possible but mostly only theoretically. I think it would need near-unanimous support from Canadians and, yes, people do not want it that badly. Generally, the majority of Canadians do not care at all. The monarchy plays no role in our lives and people would not want this issue to occupy months or years of the government's time, as would be required for such a change. If it was so simple as having a referendum, it might pass when Charles becomes King but it's not that simple, and, to be honest, I doubt enough people would even go to vote to make the referendum valid.

I quoted it in a different comment but some say it is actually more difficult to eliminate the monarchy in Canada that it is in the UK.

For me, a major drawback with an elected head of state is that it becomes another political dimension to waste time on and another part of the system to try to influence.

Currently, in the rare situations where the Canadian Governor General (stand-in head of state for the Queen) needs to make an actual decision, she or he does so after consulation with the Prime Minister and a team of constitutional advisors. Because the GG does not have to face an election, they can make a decision that is appropriate for the country, not one that is advantageous for themself.

Now imagine that head of state (president) was elected by the people. They might feel they have a mandate to do certain things. For example, they could refuse to sign a bill that has already been passed by parliament. Or they might do that because they want to get re-elected.

We do not have these concerns in Canada. The GG almost never refuses to sign a bill. We already have 2 houses of parliament to check over these bills and one of them is directly elected by the people, so the people are represented. If that doesn't work out, we have a system of courts, which will protect constitutional rights.

There is no need to throw an elected president into this mix. It's a waste of everybody's time and can actually potentially produce a worse outcome.",Canadian / German,/r/europe/comments/msvtlm/the_queen_sat_alone_socially_distanced_at_her/guzsj68/,matttk,1618770292

Not really, no.

The article: 

&gt;Less than a week after Bosnia's elections and despite the protests of relief workers, senior officials resolved today that 320,000 Bosnian refugees in Germany should begin going home on Oct. 1.

The Bosnians, most of them Muslims, became refugees when they were violently expelled from their home towns in ''ethnic cleansing'' by Bosnian Serbs. They would be sent back to a divided land in which many will not be able to return to their homes. They will begin returning as the Balkan winter approaches.

State and federal interior ministers, the officials responsible for immigration policy, said the refugees would be sent back only to ''safe areas'' in a program that would last well into 1997 and possibly longer.

Germany is home to roughly half the 700,000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia in Western Europe and has long asserted that the financial burden is too great.

''This is not a program for back-door immigration, but help in need,'' Manfred Kanther, the federal Interior Minister, said. Officials said there would be no attempt to send refugees back to areas now governed by hostile ethnic groups.

''We have to be sure that people are returned only to areas where the security situation permits it,'' said Max Stadler, a spokesman for the Free Democrats.

Other officials acknowledged that, by sending refugees back to areas controlled by their own ethnic group, the result will be a further cementing of ethnic division.

''The process of ethnic separation is regrettable, but I have met no one who has said it can be changed in the foreseeable future,'' said Gunther Beckstein, Bavaria's Interior Minister.

The first to be returned will be unmarried refugees and childless couples, who, the Germans say, are needed to start rebuilding the war-ruined country. Refugees resisting repatriation would face deportation.

Judith Kumin, the representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Germany, said it was too early to repatriate refugees reluctant to return home.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/mte72z/in_its_latest_lurch_to_the_far_right_denmark/guzt46p/,krutopatkin,1618770577

But instead of taking the lead on solving this problem globally, which is something the US used to be proud to do, they have continued Trump America's blind ""we only care about ourselves, screw the rest"" approach.  It's sad.

It's not ok to be vaccinating people who are not at risk while others who need it go without just because you can.  Given the way the virus works, it's not even beneficial - it's currently running wild in other countries who don't have the same access to vaccines and creating variants which could screw us all.  

Europe hardly put all its eggs in one basket.  It approved Moderna, BioNTech, AZ and J&amp;J and ordered tens if not hundreds of millions of doses of each.  That AZ was too incompetent to deliver what they promised, and that we now see problems with AZ and J&amp;J is mostly bad luck.

At the end of this when everything settles down, I really hope that the current sentiment that countries like the US or the UK have done well on this changes to see both of them for what they are - greedy, selfish and totally uninterested in seeing the big picture and helping to solve that if it means they have to sacrifice at all.

That's the North (and Germany) and you know which places make the bulk of their profits? The North. That is, to say, that the problem goes way beyond the Southern regions (where it's more noticeable due to people's fucked up mentality who has grown seeing their presence as normal). 

Why is the State blamed? For not attempting to clean up organized crime until they fucked up assassinating judges Falcone and Borsellino who were working to jail not only mafia bosses but also politicians of both Southern and Northern Italy who actively collaborated with the Mafia. There will never be a secession because Northern Italy profits from using the South as some kind of colony. It needs its workforce and its agricultural output. 

Another reason why the State is blamed? Not only did the Savoy gut the industry (which was little to begin with) around Naples to relocate it to the North but it also centralized pretty much anything on the Northern Triangle (Milan/Genoa/Turin) and Rome. After that, few governments have ever been interested in the South, only the Giolitti government and the Fanfani/Moro governments attempted to do something about it. What came out of it is the Cassa del Mezzogiorno, which allowed entrepreneurs to invest in the South at a lower price or for the State to fund the construction of key industries in the South. The result? Few cathedrals in the desert, they did work to create such large industries like ILVA in Taranto or Fiat in Melfi but did nothing to improve the infrastructure behind it, makiing these bad investments as the market became more and more globalized.

4467,"&gt;&gt; But it is still not a clean way and people won't forget it, so there will still be hate and tension. You can't easily forget the place where your people have been living sine the arrival of the Slavs in the Balkans, even if much history was destroyed by enemies. And it especially will feel bad for Croats and Serbs who have a strong connection to the church.
&gt;
&gt;But Bosniaks should forget the places they were exterminated from. That's not going to happen. 


I didn't say it and I didn't implie it. I was responding to the answer that some minorites are leaving already and that none will forget it, as you can't expect someone to forget it. Please don't use a strawman. 


&gt;If need be we will all stay as is for a hundred years. And unlike the Serbs or the Croats, Bosniaks are perfectly willing to achieve their political aims through politics rather than genocide. 


This is pure whitewashing of history. Bosniaks have also comitted war crimes and often by the side of Croats, who were sometimes their allies in the war. Please don't do it, noone said that Croats or Serbs didn't do crimes in the last war. 


Here you have some examples:

- Čemerno massacre, 49 dead civilian serbs attributed to the Army of Bosnia and Hercegovina, some ""Muslim armed forces and six individual Croats
( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8Cemerno_massacre?wprov=sfla1) 


- Križančevo selo massacre, at least 12 HVO POWs and 2 captured Croat civilians were killed and some sources claim more. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kri%C5%BEan%C4%8Devo_selo_massacre?wprov=sfla1) 


- Grabovica massacre, at least 33 dead Croat civilians, done by members of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The commander  Sefer Halilović and some other bosnian officers were sentenced to 13 years of prison because of this crime. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grabovica_massacre?wprov=sfla1) 


There is even more proof for ethnical cleansing done by Bosniaks, claiming one side was pure and clean while the others were devils is just wrong. 


&gt;And unlike the Croats or the Serbs, Bosniaks aren't after a pure land were the only language is Bosnian and religious priests run around blessing schools and other government buildings. I guess it's the lack of Christian genocidal influence in our national consciousness that makes us willing to tolerate others as long as they are not actively trying to exterminate us.


As mentioned above, Bosniaks were also doing ethnical cleansing and massacres, as the Serbs and Croats have done it. 

Saying 


""Christian genocidal influence in our national consciousness that makes us willing to tolerate others as long as they are not actively trying to exterminate us.""


is pretty ironic, while the muslim population were living a good life under the ottoman empire with more rights, power and luxury than the serbian or croatian population. 


Serbs and Croats were pretty oppressed, were forcefully converted to Islam and were constantly oppressed or killed for centuries. So whitewashing the history and claiming Bosniaks were the good guys who didn't do any bad and were just nice neighbours is just wrong. I am also not denying Srebrenice or any wrongdoings done to Bosniaks, because it is morally and historically wrong to do so.",Austria,/r/europe/comments/mt7748/slovenia_raises_uncomfortable_questions_with_talk/guzdvwq/,unit58469268269,1618763256

4501,"The same principles should apply to political parties and their prospectus – their manifesto – so that voters can make an informed decision about how to cast their vote. Sadly, in recent years, some politicians have abandoned any pretence at telling the truth in favour of crude election bribes or downright lies.

Boris’s Brexit bus is now the stuff of folklore, and its slogan, “We send the EU £350 million a week – let's fund our NHS instead”, a national joke.

Even when the independent head of the Office for National Statistics described the claim as ""a clear misuse of official statistics"", the Prime Minister shrugged, ruffled his hair and grinned, confident in his ability to look the voters in the eye, lie and get away with it. We will be paying the price for Boris’s duplicity for decades to come.

But the Prime Minister is not the only culprit. It could be argued that the SNP, whose manifesto was published on Thursday amid headlines declaring its promise to transform the NHS, are as cynical as Boris Johnson and his merry band of Brexiteers.

Even the most cursory examination of successive SNP manifestos since 2007 shows a litany of broken promises, from their commitment to abolish the council tax to Nicola Sturgeon’s personal and solemn pledge to close the education attainment gap.

Who can forget their promise to set up a North Sea super grid with Norway or to cut classroom sizes to 18 pupils, both of which have been long abandoned? Over the years, opposition parties have taken great delight in listing the SNP’s broken promises, but to no avail.

Remember their commitment to meeting waiting times targets – now broken over 300,000 times. And their 2010 promise of 130,000 green jobs by 2020. Today there are only 21,000 in the sector.

As The Scotsman’s deputy political editor, Gina Davidson, wrote yesterday, many Scots will vote for Sturgeon “no matter if she delivers on her promises or not”.

But if honesty mattered when setting up a national newspaper in 1816, then surely it matters now, in 2021, amid a global pandemic, when our economic future is on the line and our planet is in crisis?

Let’s examine just one of the SNP’s promises from earlier this week, Sturgeon’s pledge to transform Scotland’s NHS and restore it to its founding principles.

“The pandemic has placed exceptional pressures on our NHS – that requires an exceptional response,” the First Minister urged in her manifesto speech.

“So, over the next Parliament, we will increase frontline NHS spending by at least 20 per cent,” she promised, with an electioneering flourish. This represents a real-terms increase of 2.1 per cent per year, according to the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies.

So far, so transformational – except that last November, the UK government’s spending review promised to increase England’s NHS budget by £34 billion per year over five years – 3.4 per cent a year.

Under Barnett Formula rules, Scotland’s share of NHS funding will go up by a similar amount, but the Scottish government is free to spend the extra money how it wishes. Free bicycles anyone?

It turns out Sturgeon’s vision for Scotland’s NHS is less ambitious than the Tory government’s. Hardly Nye Bevan, not even Matt Hancock.

But at least the SNP were open about their NHS spending commitment. Their promise on reforming the Gender Recognition Act is so opaque as to be impenetrable, deliberately of course.

Until Thursday, the SNP were clear in their support for self-identification, where a person can simply declare he has changed sex and that decision has legal status – a fundamental change that would have a significant impact on everything from the household census to the Equality Act, which protects women’s sex-based rights.

Their manifesto suggests they have stepped back a little from self-ID, promising instead to work with trans people, women, equality groups, legal and human rights experts to “identify the most effective way to improve and simplify the process by which a trans person can obtain legal recognition…”

But what does that mean in practice once votes have been cast? And what of the 17,000 responses that have already been submitted to the Scottish Government’s consultation. Are they to be binned?

In a desperate attempt to establish the truth, feminist group For Women Scotland tweeted the First Minister, “We are tired of the gas-lighting and the dishonesty… cards on the table Ms Sturgeon… we are seeking clarity on the manifesto.”

They may well have a long wait. Nicola Sturgeon, like Boris Johnson, has based a successful political career on misleading the voters. “Tell them what they want to hear,” seems to be their mantra.

The SNP will win the election on May 6. Nicola Sturgeon will be First Minister. And, if she is to be believed, the people of Scotland will face a second independence referendum as soon as the pandemic is over.

And we can look forward to a second SNP White Paper setting out how Scotland leaving the UK will herald an unprecedented period of unparalleled national prosperity and cultural renewal.

But will we be able to believe a word of it? Will any future SNP prospectus on leaving the UK be honest, or useful? That, dear reader, will be for you to decide.",,/r/europe/comments/mtdmtt/scottish_election_2021_how_nicola_sturgeon_is/guyy8fx/,casualphilosopher1,1618755470

 He advocated for 'Lebensraum' in *Mein Kampf*, back in 1925.

Hitler was very openly anti-semitic even before they voted for him. They might not have realized there would be a genocide, but they could have known that Hitler wasn't going to be nice to the Jews.

Most German citizens that lived back then aren't directly responsible for the actions of the government. Of course they aren't.

""Right now he is being killed in the colony, and you can't wait any longer."" Navalny's supporters announced a rally without waiting for the gathering of half a million participants

21:00, 18 April 2021

Source: Alexey Navalny

FBK employees Ivan Zhdanov and Leonid Volkov announced an opposition rally in support of Alexei Navalny, who is on a hunger strike in the Pokrov penal colony. Their  video message was published on Navalny's YouTube channel.

There are circumstances in which you need to act quickly, otherwise the irreparable will happen. We decided not to wait for the gathering of 500 thousand people on our website. Events are moving too fast and too bad. It is no longer possible to wait and postpone. An extreme situation requires extreme solutions.

Have you ever seen with your own eyes how a person is killed? Have seen. You see it right now. And no matter how much one wants to abstract, not think about it, change the topic - this will not change the fact that Alexei Navalny is being killed. In a scary way. In front of all of us.

In March, FBK employees created the site ""Freedom to Navalny!"" With his help, the politician's team planned to gather 500 thousand people who wanted to go to a rally in support of Navalny. People willing to join the action can register there by leaving their email address. At the moment, more than 450 thousand people have registered on the site.
On March 31, Alexei Navalny went on a hunger strike in the colony. He complained of pain in his back and legs, requiring qualified medical attention. On April 15, Navalny's physicians announced a ""sharply negative"" dynamics of the politician's tests. Deputies of regional Russian parliaments and  Western artists published open letters to Russian President Vladimir Putin demanding that doctors be allowed to Navalny .

On April 15, the e-mail addresses of almost 400 thousand people from the site ""Freedom to Navalny!"" FBK apologized for the leak, but noted that they would not stop preparing for the rally. The next day, the Moscow prosecutor's office demanded to recognize the FBK and Navalny's regional headquarters as extremist organizations.",,/r/europe/comments/mtaw8i/navalnys_team_announces_mass_protest_all_over/guynh8j/,NBNebuchadnezzar,1618748898
4657,"&gt;opposing them for what ever reason is a ""green-activists""

That is a way at looking at it which isn't the one I intended, because what you are saying is factoring in politics and politically-driven people and when a comment, a legilation or anything factors in politics it stops being about that thing and becomes more of a who's boss driving into the distance away from the point. No, I want to look at this issue from the more objective side called reality as after all, politics can't stall indefinately, I'm talking about how people believe it is their job to protect all the little creatures or landscapes that surround them for individual confort rather than for other, more important reasons, and as such do irrational things",,/r/europe/comments/mt78xh/air_pollution_from_europes_coal_plants/guynhm4/,caribe5,1618748906
4658,"&gt; For which political party do you like the most?

Is no one a valid answer? :)

I personally dislike the ""centre""-right parties for their ideas, the centrist parties are more like personal parties of egocentric leaders (Renzi and Calenda; the latter is not even that bad, but I would like to vote for an idea and not for a person, since we vote for parties and not for the PM), the Five Stars are embarassing populists and governed with everybody while doing exactly the opposite they said they would have done, and the Democratic Party is too busy with internal fights to actually think about something useful for the country.

I voted PD at the municipal elections last year, but local PD of my town is way different (in a better way) from national PD and actually improved the conditions of the town in the last few years; I don't think I would like to vote for them at national elections, as of now.

&gt; Since pm Draghi arrived,over 6 millions vaccines arrived and the 1 of June swimming pools and other “secondary needs” will open.

Honestly, I also dislike this enthusiasm for Draghi: since he became PM, restrictions have been as strict as, if not even stricter than, with Conte; Easter was in the red zone for everybody as Christmas; parameters for colours have been made stricter. The curfew is still there and it will remain there also in May. What changed from when Draghi became PM?

The 6 millions of vaccines are not thanks to Draghi (and they are not thanks to Conte either, they are simply the ones that were planned to arrive and they would have arrived even with Conte as PM; Conte resigned in late January, when there was a shortage of vaccines all over the EU) and reopenings will be possible also because we are going towards summer (most of reopenings include outdoor activities).

Summer would have arrived also with Conte as PM and I don't think that the previous government wanted to keep everything closed, losing even more consensus, just in the name of a non-more-specified and non-existent ""everything-closed ideology"" (as Salvini says; do we seriously think they were happy to keep people more and more unhappy?).

&gt; 7 millions students in total will go back to school. 

Good luck with high schools opened at 100%: once again (exactly like last year with Conte) *absolutely nothing* has been done for public transportation and it will still be limited to 50%. Transportation for students has always been overcrowded, what do we do now that we fully reopen schools?

I mean, it's not that I think that this is a horrible government, and I also don't think that the Conte II cabinet was the best possible government. Still, I don't see any major improvement in the overall situation, apart from the reputation of the Prime Minister. The big positive side is that everyone is in this government and thus they are forced to collaborate instead of each party blaming the other side of the political spectrum.

However, I believe that saying that Conte was doing everything wrong, and that luckily now we have Draghi doing everything right, like politicians and press do, is a bit harsh on Conte (who, I repeat, was far from being perfect) and a bit exaggerated with regard to what the current government is doing (just two non-covid examples: what would have the press, or the opposition, said, had Conte called Erdogan a dictator or had he said that giving the citizenship to Patrick Zaki is not a matter the government is involved in?).

Obviously this is just my opinion, and I'm sorry for the very long comment, but while I dislike our politicians, I really love following politics so I tend to write a lot if asked about it :)",Italy | EU,/r/europe/comments/mt7ynk/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20210418/guynig5/,listello,1618748923

The ruling party controls the Sejm and wants to appoint its own politician (who's known for his conservatism and anti-abortion views) as the Ombudsman, but the opposition-controlled Senate won't let them do that. As such, the Ombudsman Adam Bodnar kept performing his duties despite the end of his term, as per the Ombudsman Bill.

It was followed by another march during April 19 - May 6, 1945, through the south Bohemia. Out of 1170 women (including survivers of the first march) about one hundred survived. The march ended in the village [Husinec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husinec,_Prachatice_District) after the guards fled.

In [Volary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volary) and two nearby villages 95 bodies were exhumed and reburied. 85 were identified, another two were identified in later years.

Russia won it in a war with the Turks in the 1700s.

&gt;That's not how any of this works.

According to the charter of the UNPO, it's literally how it works. 

https://unpo.org/article/4957

It's also the very first article in chapter 1 

The UN Charter and resolutions: ""Chapter 1, Article 1, part 2 states that purpose of the UN Charter is: ""To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights **and self-determination of peoples**, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace.""

This was laid out in the Kosovo precedent.

They didn't steal it. They respected Crimea's vote on independence and their vote to join Russia. 

The easiest solution was for the UN not to play politics and hear Crimea's case for self-determination instead of ignore it

4789,"&gt;Mine? How could Crimea have been the United States' territory, exactly?

I'm sorry, I'm not used to seriously consider that a Kremlin propagandist is actually not a Russian.

&gt;Russia won it in a war with the Turks in the 1700s.

And gave it away to Ukraine when both were part of the USSR and lost it totally when Ukraine achieved independence. 

Also, covertly invading a foreign country and orchestrating a more than dubious referendum there is not a manifestation anyone's right to self-determination.

&gt;This was laid out in the Kosovo precedent. 

There never was a ""Kosovo precedent"" the way Russians claim there was. And even if there was, it wouldn't work how Russia claims it works.

&gt;They didn't steal it. 

They literally stole it. Illegally covertly invaded a foreign country's territory, orchestrated a shady referendum there and then claimed the territory wanted to join Russia. That's 100% the kind of shit the Soviets pulled in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1940...

&gt;So, who really stole Crimea?

Russia.

&gt;The easiest solution was for the UN not to play politics and hear Crimea's case for self-determination instead of ignoring it

Just a few paragraphs above you praised UN principles, so why don't you like them now?

4844,"&gt;Part of the point of having a large EU is that you have a diversified economy in aggregate.

I agree, but i have to give it to them, there is a lot of money being misspent. I will give you a practical example. In Europe there are these funds for the farmers, the objective is to modernize farms and increase efficiency and production, however here in Portugal what most farmers did was buy a new car or spend the money on their houses. Even to this day in my parish people sow tomato plantings by hand, i mean 10 to 20 people with no real wage to speak of, earning by hour, to do something a tractor and a planting attachment would do in 1/10 of the time with just a little diesel. This simple example applies to the economy as a whole, funds to purchase equipment for companies end up being spent on things that are not related to said equipment, it's just misspending and from my point of view that's why a country like Portugal getting funds since 1986 was overtaken by almost all of the ex-soviet states, because instead of investing money, we just spend money.",,/r/europe/comments/mspcu1/maximum_level_of_eu_recovery_and_resilience_fund/guy7tj2/,scalabitano,1618734394

5012,"I won't repeat myself too much here, but as I said previously one should not focus on the unit price much, since the lifetime cost is the true price to pay in the end.  


My guess (and this is a guess!) is that SAAB and Lockheed Martin have focused on making the cost for their aircraft look as good as possible in two separate domains. Lockheed Martin has focused on making the unit price look as low as possible, by putting as much of the cost under operating expenses as possible. SAAB may have done the opposite to get that $4700 per hour figure you reference elsewhere (which I am pretty sure is from Janes 2012 report which is for the Gripen C/D and not the Gripen E/F, so it is for a different fighter jet), by moving as much of the operating costs to bulk payments in the beginning, driving unit prices up. After all of that price manipulation, determining the true price is hard, but the finnish HX fighter jet program tenders really do suggest the Gripen E/F to be cheaper. It would be unreasonable to think SAAB skimped on training and spare parts to such a degree that they saved 1 billion euro from a 10 billion euro contract. Especially since the finnish defence agency seems to [think all tenders are of a similar price](https://corporalfrisk.com/tag/hx/) (read the post from the 23 January).

If you want to read up more on the finnish fighter jet procurement, I highly suggest reading [Corporal Frisk's blog.](https://corporalfrisk.com/tag/hx/) Everything is based on open source intelligence, so one should read everything with a critical eye, but I do think the blog does a good job of not drawing stronger conclusions than the limited evidence suggests.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/mryado/france_preparing_to_offer_rafale_jets_to_ukraine/guxr5kc/,The_StoneWolf,1618720204

5071,"The Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican (Basilica Papale di San Pietro in Vaticano), or simply Saint Peter's Basilica (Latin: Basilica Sancti Petri), is a church built in the Renaissance style located in Vatican City, the papal enclave that is within the city of Rome.

A church has stood on the current site since the time of the Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Old St. Peter's Basilica dates from the 4th century AD. Construction of the present basilica began on 18 April 1506 and was completed on 18 November 1626 unde Pope Paul V. It is designed as a three-aisled Latin cross with a dome at the crossing, directly above the high altar, which covers the shrine of St. Peter the Apostle. 

Designed principally by Donato Bramante, Michelangelo, Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, St. Peter's is the most renowned work of Renaissance architecture and the largest church in the world by interior measure. The edifice—the church of the popes—is a major pilgrimage site.

While it is neither the mother church of the Catholic Church nor the cathedral of the Diocese of Rome (these titles being held by the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome), St. Peter's is regarded as one of the holiest Catholic shrines. It has been described as ""holding a unique position in the Christian world"" and as ""the greatest of all churches of Christendom"".

Catholic tradition holds that the basilica is the burial site of Saint Peter, chief among Jesus's apostles and also the first Bishop of Rome (Pope). Saint Peter's tomb is supposedly directly below the high altar of the basilica. For this reason, many popes have been interred at St. Peter's since the Early Christian period.

5074,"It is not insane, but it can be difficult.

Check formal requirements. Your US high school degree might not be sufficient. 

There is a language barrier. At many programs, courses and written exams are in the local language. Even when courses are offered in English, the local administration might require the local language, contracts will be in the local language (signing contracts you can't understand is a really bad idea), landlords might prefer tenants fluent in the local language, and some of the locals you encounter might be unable or unwilling to communicate in a foreign language. 

Finding a place to rent from abroad can be very difficult if you're not participating  in some kind of exchange program. In some locations, scammers are targeting foreigners trying to rent from abroad. 

The university system is different to the US college system. For example, if you study mathematics at a US college, in the first semester, you might have both an English language course and a history course, and those ""soft"" courses would comprise a significant percentage of the credits earned during the first semester. If, however, you study mathematics at a German university, the whole program will just consist of courses in various areas of mathematics your chosen minor.  

There also is everyday life in a foreign country. Don't expect to see many US imports in European grocery stores. Don't expect a selection of 100 different types of peanut butter. The supermarket shelves will be filled with what locals prefer. Price levels will be different to what you're used to, some goods will be significantly cheaper, some other goods will be significantly more expensive. And initially you won't know the normal local price level, and you won't know which stores are overprices, and which stores offer good deals. 

Large European cities often are densely packed. The best way to get around might be crowded public transport or a bicycle. Many stores inn the city do not have any parking.

About the Skripals, why did it, according to the official story, take 4 hours between grabbing the door handle and resting in the park on the way home before the ""military grade"" nerve agent to act, and then simultaneously and approximately equally on father and daughter?  Also, why was it announced by the British government that the police officer who was contaminated was a ""first responder"" at the park and then changing their story that he was the first police officer to arrive at Skripal's home?  Also, how did a perfume bottle, still in the perfume manufacturers packagine, containing the same nerve agent turn up in a donation bin a couple of months later where it ended up killing the girl friend of the guy who found it?  And especially, why isn't the daughter Yulia Skripal allowed to give live interviews about the events around the poisoning, for, in any case, she had nothing to do with her father's treason against Russia and Putin and would no more be in the sights of Russian assassins than, say, Lewis Hamilton?  I think Sergio and Yulia Skripal were engaged in spying against the UK, the two Russians were couriers and picked up documents at a drop off point, the Brits were on to things and tried to poison Sergio and Yulia before the pickup, but failed; and Yulia and Sergio are not locked away so as not to  let the cat out of the bag.  British intelligence completely dismantled Skripal's ho me -- walls and floorinIg torn out -- to be absolutely certain no compromising documents were left hidden in the woodwork.

5255,"&gt; The vast majority of them have fought on the front lines, hate them all you want but at least find a decent reason rather than this tired idea they do nothing

The reason I think the monarchy should be abolished as part of the government is that I dislike the possibility of a monarch with no democratic mandate interfering with government.

If we're going to get rid of the Fixed-Term Parliament Act (which seems like it might happen soon, the Conservatives pledged to repeal it at the last election), then the PM can dissolve parliament with a simple majority, with only the monarch able to block it.

The convention was that the monarch could only block a dissolution if certain conditions were met: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascelles_Principles

In my opinion, even this rarely used power is too much for the monarch. _Any_ power is too much! Maybe there should be an elected head of state with almost no power except the power the monarch has currently, who cannot be associated with any political party, ever have been an MP or peer, and can never become one.

They can still do all the other stuff like owning their properties, joining the military, and so on. All I want is to get rid of this undemocratic stain on our society. It's a pretty small stain and it's not high up my list of priorities, but I decisively fall on one side of this issue.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/msvtlm/the_queen_sat_alone_socially_distanced_at_her/gux3kdw/,sumduud14,1618706003

The decision not to prosecute happened on **30 March 2021**.

That was what sparked the riots. Previously people thought prosecutions for breaking the law would proceed - in other words, there was no reason to riot before, because they thought due process would take care of things.

Due process didn't happen. 

People like yourself pretending that people shouldn't mind Sinn Fein being terrorist-supporting Covid-breaking shitbags are a big part of the problem.

*Why* do you worship Sinn Fein and their terrorist worship? Why do you worship that they broke covid rules and put people in danger?

Both the terrorism worship and the covid-breaking worship points to a mindset that gets excited when people die.

I am _also_ sympathetic to the idea that the EU should have anticipated these supply issues and spent billions of Euros to counteract them far earlier than it did.

5441,"&gt; He clearly states that violence is integral part 

No. He states that it could be needed if the ruling class resists, to which he is mostly certain they will, mainly because of the times he was living in, where there have been constant revolutions happenings and people murdered by the ruling class. It does not state that a revolution has to inherently 100% be bloody and to murder people. This is what you don't get and why you made that first comment above with equating it to Nazism. Nazism has inherently build in violence and murder of other humans in it, communism doesn't, no matter whether someone likes it as an ideology or not.

&gt;  every time this ideology was tried violence was integral 

None of which have been done by him, but nevertheless: This can be said about any other ideology too. There was no bloodless revolution and change of power anywhere. When the current ruling class does not want to give up its power, then revolutions become bloody. This does not make the ideology that drives the revolution to be inherently bloody.

How much simpler do I have to explain this? Did capitalism came to be without blood and murders? Democracy? Even Liberal social values fighting against conservative ones? And so on and so on.

&gt; it's you who can't accept that your interpretation of the ideology is wrong.

5479," **MINSK, April 17 - RIA Novosti.** President of Belarus [Alexander Lukashenko](http://ria.ru/person_Aleksandr_Lukashenko/) announced the arrest of a group of people who were preparing an attempt on the life of him and his children.

“They showed how it was all planned &lt;...&gt;, then we clearly discovered the work of foreign special services, most likely the CIA, the [FBI](http://ria.ru/organization_FBR/) \- I don't know which of the Americans worked there. We discovered their desire to come to [Minsk](http://ria.ru/location_Minsk/) and start organizing the assassination attempt on the president and children, ""Lukashenko told reporters. The video was shown by the ONT TV channel.

According to him, the plans of this group was to capture his children - ""one, the second, as it turns out,"" they wanted to ""put in a cellar"", which, as Lukasheno pointed out, was prepared in the Gomel region.“I am surprised by something else. Why are the Americans behaving this way? After all, remember that no one can give consent except the top political leadership. Only they, no special services,” stressed the Belarusian president.

As Lukashenka stated, political scientist Alyaksandr Feduta, lawyer Yuriy Zenkovich, head of the opposition BPF party Grigoriy Kastusev were involved in this. The first two were detained in Moscow after the Belarusian president addressed Vladimir Putin, he said. ""Agents flew from the USA, some Zenkovich. We tracked them, watched, they were afraid to go here after we detained several groups who brought weapons here and hid them in hiding places. They left for Moscow,"" the head of state said.

 According to him, Kostusev participated in the preparation of the assassination attempt ""to a lesser extent."" “He was not in Moscow, we got to know him here, and a number of others. They are already visible today, so we can voice some information. I asked the President of Russia, and (Head of the KGB of Belarus Ivan Tertel. - Ed.) Tertel - his colleague, Sasha Bortnikov, the FSB, and we took them there,"" Lukashenka said.","Crimea, Russian Federation",/r/europe/comments/msygxu/lukashenko_announces_a_group_of_assassins_were/guwbuzc/,TsarinaElizabeta,1618691525

I remember my first time having it when I visited France a few years ago. I was given a bit from a local place that makes it, and the first bite was actually really nice and delicate. The second bite and the fatty flavor comes out. By the third bite all the good things about the first bite were gone and it had this almost oily taste to it.

What shocked me was how people ate it. I found the flavor so strong and poorly refined that I had to smear it in very thin amounts to keep everything from tasting like fat, but others were just gobbing it in heaping clumps.

It honestly reminded me very much of how Americans eat at county fairs, just going for the absolute fattiest sugarless and saltiness shit without any reflection about the actual nuance that food is supposed to provide.

True, but that doesn't mean that there isn't always enough information for an educated public to understand wether or not an aircraft fits certain roles.

&gt;You for example say that the Rafael has ""one of the best electronic warfare suits""

I am saying that because that system, the SPECTRA, is a combat proven suite. It has sensors that cover the entire spectrum from RF to IR, processes the information, identifies and tracks threats and automatically deploys countermeasures (jamming from active phased arrays, chaff, decoys etc). During the allied intervention in the 1st Libyan civil war, the Rafales were having a walk in the park above the Libyan air-defences. Last summer an unidentified aircraft, possibly a Rafale as indicated by the weapons used, slipped into Libya undetected and interdicted sensitive equipment in a turkish-run airbase. This system makes the Rafale an intelligence gathering platform like the F-35.

&gt;How can we know what is a ""good"" radar?

Well I guess an AESA radar that can track and engage multiple targets and with high output to detect threats at longer distances is considered a ""good"" radar nowadays.",,/r/europe/comments/mryado/france_preparing_to_offer_rafale_jets_to_ukraine/guve57g/,LofTW,1618677414

The good news is that that after the abortion ban the Duck and Friends took a nosedive and stabilized about 10 points below their former position. There is also a new party that is appealing to conservatives of the more ""live and let live"" attitude that are displeased with PiS and the alliance of the throne with the altar - they seem to be doing pretty well in the polls, comparable to the largest opposition party. if elections took place today, PiS would loose power - while they're still getting the biggest piece of the pie, opposition parties would be able to form a government by allying together (which is something their voters expect from them).

5740,"Well, I cannot talk for the other countries, and I'm not an expert of Hungarian educational system, either, I just have eyes and ears. In Hungary the main reason is simply the political agenda. Less educated people can be  manipulated easier, ancient wisdom.

We've never been a rich country, and still could manage a relatively high standard of education in the past, even under communist rule.  With honest political will this standard could be kept, maybe raised.  But none of our governments in the last 3 decades seemed to care a bit.

Just a few examples:

1. In around 2008 the actual (socialist) government wanted to introduce univerity fees for students. Until then it was free. FIDESZ, in opposition at the time started a referendum against it, stating that young people coming from poorer families won't be able to afford this. Financial background would be decisive about university scholarship, not the talent of a child. (Which is true.) The referendum was succesfull. Three years later the same party (FIDESZ) introduced university fees, without any referendum or social discussion.
2. The salary of teachers (in public schools) is controlled by the government, and it is (and was for decades) ridiculously low. Many young would-be-teacher turn away from the profession and seeks for other, better paid jobs. This creates several problems: there is a continuous shortage of teachers, one teacher has to deal with more children than optimal, and their average age is too high, which means a lack of new views, ideas, vision and knowledge, etc.
3. Just a few days ago the biggest union of teachers protested against the reopening of schools saying it's too early in the current pandemic wave, and not safe for the children AND the teachers (Hungary has one of the highest death/capita rates right now in the world). The government called the union ""an opposition organisation"", refused their demand, and also denied to bring teachers as a group forward in vaccination.",,/r/europe/comments/msb8km/yet_again_polands_state_television_is_telling_its/guuqq8u/,nyafimacs,1618669488

I am not advocating for tax sheltering, but there has been a weird fetish lately of paying as much taxes as possible to the government, which I just cannot understand. I understand the case for said corporations to pay taxes and all, but there has been a huge support for any raise of taxes mentioned in any country lately, which I just see as absurd. 

If you genuinely think that said taxes would have gone to wage earners instead, you are delusional af. It would have gone to investors yet again, just in another way. The only difference being is that the government will take 30-40% in the process. 

I know this is not a super popular opinion, but all the popular opinions have been garbage lately and I am tired of this lazy political notion forming at every damn developed country. Wage stagnation? Raise minimum wage. High rents? Rent control. Tax evasion? Ban heavens. Just because it’s an easy way and seems logical on the surface doesn’t mean it fucking works.

5843,"The country would remain implacably divided for a generation, with Remain and Leave replacing class and geography as the new fault line in British politics. International investors would take a generation to come round to the idea. And campaigns to re-join the EU would grow in strength as the chaos deepened. Even a few months ago, it was possible to argue that Britain's tortured debate about leaving the EU would run and run without any seeming end. And yet since then something very interesting has happened. The UK’s comparative success at rolling out Covid-19 vaccines has in effect sealed the Brexit deal. The debate is now over, both here, and around the world.

A poll out today – carried out by JL Partners for the often fanatically pro-Remain Bloomberg – shows that 62 per cent of people believe that leaving the EU helped the UK roll out vaccines more quickly than it could have done as a member. Another 67 per cent believe the EU has been ‘hostile’ to the UK during the row over vaccine supply. And, reflecting on all that, 54 per cent of people would vote to stay out in a rerun of the referendum, one of the highest margins in favour of our departure since the vote itself back in 2016. Bre-mourse? Bre-grets? Those it seems are now safely in the past. If there was a vote – a People’s one, or some other sort – we know what the result would be. Brits are now firmly of the view that we did the right thing by getting out. In effect, it has shifted public opinion decisively in favour of leaving.

The effect may be even more dramatic internationally. Over the last five years, most businesses, trade bodies and governments bought into the standard hardcore Remainer narrative. Inside the boardrooms of Tokyo, San Francisco, or Dubai, insofar as they took any interest in the matter, they largely accepted it was a vote driven by racists, nostalgic for the Empire and hoodwinked by some deceitful slogans on the side of a bus. And they accepted the view that it would be catastrophic for the economy, and that on the whole the UK was best avoided until the British got over the whole episode and asked to re-join. And yet, over the last few weeks they have instead seen a fairly modern, well-organised nation rolling out vaccines pretty successfully – and that too is changing perceptions.

It is not hard to see what has happened. For both domestic and international audiences, the UK has demonstrated scientific prowess, regulatory efficiency, and innovative, effective government. And the EU? Well, without rehashing the whole sorry mess, not so much. The vaccines may or may not end the Covid-19 pandemic. We will have to wait and see, although the figures so far suggest the impact on deaths, hospitalisations, and even infections, have been dramatic. But they already seem to have ended the debate over Brexit – which, come to think of it, is almost as miraculous an achievement.",,/r/europe/comments/mspqoc/the_uks_vaccine_rollout_has_ended_the_brexit/guua6fe/,casualphilosopher1,1618662201

A tiny amount that is more then offset by the US own production these days (and before it was mostly Canadian import anyway, the US has never relied much on Russian oil). That import from Russian oil is just traders making use of low prices. It's not the US needing the resources. The US is the largest oil producing country in the world these days. The issue for the US is cost. Their oil production is a bit more expensive and more difficult to extract compared to Russia and Saudi-Arabia, so when oil prices drop they start importing more, when it rises they start exporting more.

The issue for Europe is of course we don't have the same kind of oil reserves on our soil. So we need to import and then Russia is close by.",,/r/europe/comments/mspinu/why_does_europe_rely_heavily_of_russia_and_china/guuai8f/,cissoniuss,1618662332

Now, Volt Europa, which got 3/7% of votes, **became now part of the new municipal government of Frankfurt**, together with the Green party (24.6%), the social democratic party (SPD 17.0%), and the liberal democrats (FDP 7.6%). And they have achieved it to substantially enlarge the Green's room for action on environmental politics, in which the FPD  had so far been blocking any movement for the better. Here is the breakdown of the last municipal election:

The great thing is that Volt Europe was founded as a response to the Brexit referendum (but of course, also to find a response to the collective challenges in terms of environment, social politics, employment,  and the refugee crisis). So, as we see, as unlikely as it sounds, and as painful it is sometimes to watch the process and what it does to people, there are also at least a few good things resulting from Brexit :-)

Today however, cutbacks on welfare, more expensive living (inflated gas prices, high electricity cost due to closure of nuclear power plants, taxes on feudal things such as plastic bags) have made the people less supportive of the government, throw in stuff like high drug deaths, corrupt construction projects, government mandated discrimination and the extraordinary idiotic handling of the global pandemic and we are soon to have a shift from our current ruling party, the only reason we have not had it earlier is primarily because when old people look back they see what our current ruling party have done for the people and believe that they are still on their side.
