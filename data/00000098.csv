1,"&gt; No , they go where there's economic development . Ideally they want to front-run economic development .

No, they don't care whether there is economic growth. The only thing they care about is the likelihood of getting their money, they don't give a shit about whether the country needs to sell the organs of its citizens for it or not.

&gt;NYC is the financial capital of the world because it's the financial center of the most economically developed country on earth .

No, because it had links to London, the previous one, and the USA was military dominating all former economic great powers in 1945.

20,"The EU is failing -and that failure was inevitable, predictable and predicted- because it is built on the myth of ‘European unity’. Pretending even harder that it exists when it doesn’t exist will not suddenly make it so. National loyalty on the other hand actually does exist and will continue to exist, and so it makes far more sense that we arrange our governance accordingly.

As soon as someone desperately resorts to blaming Russia for the shortcomings of the EU -or votes going against the EU- they cease to have any credibility. It does not require a serious response.

&gt; You keep repeating the EU is undemocratic, but you don't know why.

Because whenever a nation’s citizens vote against further subjugation by the EU they are told to vote again and keep voting until they give the correct result. Some democracy. Only the UK so far has been strong enough to stand up to these anti-democratic forces, and even that was a close run thing.

43,"&gt;As I said, this is not just about where do large corporations pay their taxes. Low taxes stimulate the economy and are good even if no company came back from Ireland.

Expenses also stimulate the economy. So it all depends on how it's targeted. Usually tax and spend is more stimulating because it has an inherente distributive effect. Money is the oil of the economy: you have the spread it out, if it's all pooling up in one place your motor has a problem.

&gt;Yet in all the other factors they are 100% pro economic liberty. They are among the countries in Europe with higher economic liberty, even with their state intervention in some key aspects, because in the rest they are top. Welfare state and economic liberty are not mutually exclusive, in fact, the former needs the latter.

That dependency is mutual. You're not building an top economy on a sickly and unsecure workforce.

You’re not going to say, “They chose it” “It’s just crumbs” and it’ll be ok, it doesn’t work like that. How can you even be so hypocritical by immediately saying “I think it’s wrong” too? Why do you try to justify it then? And you also come straight to the point, it’s in our own country! We are not hurting you with tax evasion. And it is wrong, which is why it’s illegal. It’s also why the government, more specifically the Gurdia di Finanza, is constantly cracking down on tax evaders. This is a gradual process, what do you expect? And even if it was done instantly, it may hurt more than it fixes. Millions jobless. Not something that helps the economy. So going at it at this pace is correct, we need to create solutions while cracking down on tax evaders. It’s not about being special, it’s about being smart about it.

People that are honest and pay that taxes in Italy are very angry about the ones that do everything in black, so the fact that you don’t like paying taxes is not something that the Italians that pay them don’t share, but they know it’s right.

Then you’re talking about this being the problem. You clearly don’t understand what the problem is. The problem is that until things benefit you, you do them, then when it’s about the collective good, you immediately stop.

Many nations and the Arctic communities themselves are seeing new investment opportunities, especially in Greenland, while the strategic importance of the High North is attracting renewed attention from the major powers.  


Some countries are trying to impose new norms to put their own strong imprint on the region. It has been many years since the Arctic has been in such sharp focus. It is a new reality that we need to be aware of. 

 America's goal is a secure and stable Arctic, where the Arctic nations and their inhabitants work together to create common prosperity, while also addressing the common challenges.  


When the Arctic Council was established in 1996 by the eight Arctic nations, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Canada, Russia and the United States, it was a landmark achievement that continues to serve us well, because the Council provides a multilateral forum for common , peaceful governance.  


Thanks to the Arctic Council, the eight Arctic countries have largely respected each other's sovereign interests in the area. International agreements on scientific research, shipping, rescue work and environmental protection are all concrete examples of the successful ""low voltage cooperation"" in the region.  


But the changes in the physical environment in the Arctic are leading to new and complex opportunities and challenges. While Greenland is on the verge of embarking on a new era of innovation and productivity, some governments are operating to a different standard and are waiting to take advantage of the opportunity to introduce their authoritarian values ​​into the region's future development.  


As an Arctic nation and as a faithful partner, it is America's highest wish to see Greenland and the entire Arctic region thrive, but that development must not come at the expense of security and sustainability in the area.  


The aggressive Russia  
Russia's pattern of aggressive behavior and increased militarization in the Arctic is an imminent global concern.  


The country has rebuilt many of its Cold War bases, established a new Arctic command and four new Arctic brigades, upgraded old airfields and other Arctic infrastructure, including deep water ports, and established new military bases along the country's Arctic coastline.

  In 2018, Russia inaugurates an Arctic airfield at Nagurskoye, deploying bombers capable of reaching Thulebase in northwest Greenland at short - or no - notice.  


In addition, Russia is in the process of extending the base's runway from 2,500 to 3,500 meters; it makes it much longer than is needed for defensive fighter aircraft. All these investments in new military capabilities reveal Russia's growing ambitions, which challenge the West's common goal of a peaceful and prosperous region.  


The Greek and polluting China  
The People's Republic of China calls itself an Arctic state, though there are nearly 1,500 kilometers between the Arctic and China. The People's Republic is gradually trying to penetrate the region, considering the Arctic as yet another place to promote the regime's predatory economic interests and authoritarian values.  


The regime is trying to gain a foothold in the region by building icebreakers, including a nuclear-powered one of its kind. Unmanned observation posts are set up and large and sophisticated data collections are made in countries in the region, including the USA, Iceland, Greenland and Canada. According to the White Paper, published in 2018, entitled 'China's Arctic Policy', an attempt is being made to establish a polar version of the Silk Road by developing sailing routes through the Arctic.  


This could enable the People's Republic to promote its hostile values ​​and self-sufficient economic interests. The People's Republic is also trying to seize the region's valuable resources by exploring the opportunities for duplex, civil and military infrastructure and securing mining licenses to several areas of the region containing uranium and other rare earths.  


Considering how grossly the People's Republic is violating international rules elsewhere in the world - for example, in the South China Sea - and how to pollute its own land, water and air, the growing focus on the Arctic is with its peaceful and fragile environment particularly alarming.  


Aid package for Greenland  
Quite unlike Russia and the People's Republic, America's vision for the Arctic is based on transparency, cooperation and democratic values.  


The United States will be the preferred partner in the Arctic, and we hope to achieve such a partnership through a direct commitment that accelerates sustainable development and prosperity in the region, all based on ideals of good governance, transparency and respect for human rights that has made freedom-loving communities thrive.  


The soon-to-be-opened consulate in Nuuk will be our starting point for increased, daily contact with the Greenlandic people. Over the past year, an American diplomat has traveled around Greenland to exchange views and make connections with all sorts of people, students, business people and representatives from both the state and the municipality. Now that our diplomatic presence becomes permanent, we hope to further deepen and strengthen the relationship between the United States, Greenland and Denmark.  


It is our wish to work with the entire Danish empire to promote entrepreneurship and innovation and thus stimulate sustainable economic growth in the Arctic. The US government is preparing a substantial package of financial support that will provide renewable energy for growth in Greenland.  


And for the first time in more than 30 years, the Faroe Islands were visited by an American naval vessel in 2019 as a sign that we would like to strengthen our mutual safety and economic and scientific cooperation. The United States will also continue to bridge Greenlanders, Faroes and Americans through exchange programs that strengthen our respective knowledge and thus spur economic development - all to increase the resilience of Arctic and Subarctic communities.  


In the future, the United States can help Greenland reach its great potential, open new markets, increase sustainable tourism and set new standards for development in the region. The untapped resources in the entire Arctic are truly remarkable and include oil and gas, fish that are important to global food supply, rare earths, and most importantly, people who strive to make progress in their lives.  


 The West must wake up  
From the American perspective, the Arctic must continue to be an area that is stable and free of conflicts where the polar nations cooperate in good faith. To guarantee that the Arctic remains a safe area of ​​prosperity, the United States will cooperate with our allies in Europe and North America. The United States will also continue to participate in the significant work of the Arctic Council - an organization that is essential to the region's peace and stability.  


Even now that we try to get on top of the covid-19 pandemic, the Western world can no longer ignore the importance of the Arctic with its unique, changeable environment, its strategic location and its potential. The United States and the Trump administration have embarked on waking up the West and moving away from our shared remoteness before other less reliable governments begin to shape the region's values ​​in their own repressive mirror image.

340,"In the Eu, 17.1% of the population were living in overcrowded households in 2018, meaning they did not have enough rooms compared to the size of the household. Although merrier, overcrowded households can feel even smaller with kids playing in the same room as parents trying to telework during the coronavirus lockdown. Moreover, overcrowded environments can present a higher risk of spreading the virus.

On the other hand, staying home alone for days on end brings its own set of challenges as well. In the EU, more than one in three persons (33.0%) lived in under-occupied dwellings in 2018, meaning that the dwellings were deemed to be too large, in terms of excess rooms and more specifically bedrooms, for the needs of the household living in it.

Among the EU Member States, almost half the population in Romania (46.3%) were living in overcrowded households in 2018. This was also the case for around two in every five persons in Latvia (43.4%), Bulgaria (41.6%), Croatia (39.3%) and Poland (39.2%). Compared to the previous year, the share of the population living in overcrowded dwellings fell slightly in all of these countries except Latvia (+1.5 percentage points), with the strongest fall recorded in Poland (-1.3 pp).

At the opposite end of the scale, the lowest overcrowding rates were recorded in Cyprus (2.5%), Ireland (2.7%), Malta (3.4%) and the Netherlands (4.1%).

The share of young people and children that live in overcrowded dwellings is much higher than for the elderly. In 2018, almost one quarter (24.1%) of people aged 18 year or less lived in overcrowded dwellings in the EU, while only 6.9% of those aged 65 years and older did. In particular, 40.2% of young people in the EU who were living in households at risk of poverty were also living in overcrowded dwellings.

In 2018, almost three quarters of the population were living in under-occupied dwellings in Malta (73.4%), Ireland and Cyprus (both 71.4%). In Belgium (58.6%), Spain (56.3%), the Netherlands (53.9%) and Luxembourg (53.7%), more than half of the population were living in dwellings deemed too large. From 2017 to 2018, the largest drops in share of the population living in under-occupied dwellings were recorded in Luxembourg (-1.8 percentage points), Denmark (-1.7 pp) and Sweden (-1.0 pp).

In contrast, less than 15% of the population were living in dwellings deemed to be too large in Romania (7.3%), Latvia (9.9%), Greece (10.4%), Bulgaria (11.5%), Croatia (11.6%), Slovakia (12.7%), Poland (14.4%) and Italy (14.9%).

1. It really depends on the person, but I'd say in my experience it's generally true. I always answer ""I'm fine,"" but am also cursed with Resting Sad Face and growing up was often asked ""Really? Cause you don't *look* fine."" I am fine! It's just my face!
2. I think this one's pretty much correct. Unsure of what they're saying or being sarcastic. I'm trying to think if we use a phrase that means the same, but I can't come up with anything. Maybe I'm too tired.
3. Untrue. ""Not bad"" translates directly to ""niet slecht"" and that phrase means the exact same thing. It's said when something exceeds expectations or is really very good. It can be used to mean mediocre, but that depends on situation and tone. Just like in English.
4. It *really* depends on who it's coming from, I'd say. If it's a friend, I'd probably think it was just a suggestion. If it's a coworker or a boss or maybe a family member who likes to involve themselves in other people's business, then I'd see it as pretty passive aggressive.
5. Yeah, I'd say this one is correct. ""Bit disappointed"" means there was a tiny fault and it doesn't really matter. Be nice, but *honest* in criticism.
6. I don't think this one's correct. ""Please think about it some more"" would be seen by a lot of people, including myself, as ""this is a bad idea, what are you thinking?"" If I suggested something and that was the answer, I wouldn't think they'd like my idea.
7. Pretty much untrue. ""That's interesting"" has two meanings in Dutch and they're the same as in English. It can either mean that something is mildly interesting or that something is awful and you're trying to be polite.
8. Another ""depends on the tone and who's saying it"", but overall also pretty much untrue. The phenomenon of politely inviting someone and not actually meaning it exists in the Netherlands too. I've had tons of conversations with old classmates where we swore to catch up and we all knew we'd never see each other again. At least not on purpose.

483,"because ""supply chains"" is mostly about manufacturing and as a purchaser you already have the option to buy from whomever you want. The reason why they continue to buy from China is because of quality, price, product, logistics; China dominates in nearly all of those except for quality which when there are millions of manufacturers you are going to get a range. This is why most of their purchasing is from China and not Vietnam, Malaysia, Mexico, elsewhere. This is not going to change that much or at all. A lot of the investment into factories in those other developing countries are from Chinese companies or China-funded local companies. Are you expecting European countries to fund and specialize in manufacturing locally or to fund those factories to replace the imported products from China? That would be expensive with incredibly high chance of business failure because you would compete directly against those Chinese companies. Therefore to make this viable as a business you would have to mandate some sort of purchasing requirement to only allow specific companies owned by EU to bid from, which sounds great in priciple but if they keep free-market principles and an open EU market then any competitor based in EU who can still import from Chinese companies would put you out of business; then all the money you invested into local or outsourced manufacturing would be lost.

In 2019, exports of books to countries outside the EU amounted to EUR 1.9 billion and the corresponding imports to 1.6 billion.

Over the last decade, exports of books to countries outside the EU increased by 18%, from EUR 1.6 billion in 2009 to EUR 1.9 billion in 2019. During the same period, imports of books remained at EUR 1.6 billion.

The main EU countries are the same for export and for imports: in 2019, Germany exported books for EUR 563 million and imported for EUR 277 million, France exported books for EUR 364 million and imported for EUR 229 million, while Spain exported books for EUR 286 million and imported for EUR 196 million.

 Overall, EUR 5.1 billion worth of books were sold in the EU in 2018. Compared with 2008, sold production decreased by 28% from EUR 7.0 billion.

Among EU Member States, the largest producer of books was Germany, with EUR 889 million. Poland (EUR 661 million) and Spain (EUR 604 million) printed large amounts of books.

https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB15656

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28579232

**Vehicle**

According to the study it uses a modified [MVA virus as the vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_vaccinia_Ankara#Challenge_studies_in_primates).  MVA (Modified Vaccinia Ankara) is an attenuated vaccine of a poxvirus.

Their reason for using MVA is probably founded on ensuring that the body responds to the vaccine. Quite often when a vaccine is in testing, the virus antigens are correctly administered and enter the body, but for reasons of how the vehicle is put together the body simply doesnt react to it. And the virus particles simply degrade before an adaptive immune response can form. Reactions to Pox viruses tends to be quite aggressive from what I've heard. 

**Vector coding sequences**

Coronavirus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, however ironically the vector they are using is DNA. Probably for storage/stability reasons this would be the better choice. I'm not sure yet about it's strandedness, it could be in a circular plasmid (from engineered bacteria) or in linear; double-stranded or single-stranded. 

The genetic sequence is described here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5516308/figure/f0005/

598,"&gt;  In contrast to her relatively poor average approval rating as prime minister,[275] Thatcher has since ranked highly in retrospective opinion polling and, according to YouGov, she is ""see[n] in overall positive terms"" by the British public.[387] She was voted the fourth-greatest British prime minister of the 20th century in a poll of 139 academics organised by MORI.[388]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; \#Reputation

 Over half of all Labour MPs chose to boycott the tribute to Thatcher,[58] with many saying it would have been hypocritical for them to honour her as their constituents continued to suffer from some of the decisions she made.[59][53] Retired MP Tony Benn, former London mayor, Ken Livingstone, and Paul Kenny, General Secretary of the GMB trade union, stated that her policies were divisive and her legacy involved ""the destruction of communities, the elevation of personal greed over social values and legitimising the exploitation of the weak by the strong"",

Many reactions were unsympathetic,[62] particularly from her opponents.[63][64][65] Residents in Orgreave, South Yorkshire, site of the Battle of Orgreave between striking coal miners and police in June 1984, declared that their village had been ""decimated by Thatcher"".[66] The AP quoted a number of miners as responding to her death simply with ""good riddance"".[67] Chris Kitchen, General Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, stated that miners would ""not be shedding a tear for her"".[68] A mock funeral was held in the pit village of Goldthorpe in South Yorkshire, in which an effigy of Thatcher was burned alongside the word ""scab"" spelled out in flowers.[69]

Spontaneous street parties were held by some across Britain, comparable to the enthusiasm shown for the assassination of incumbent Prime Minister Spencer Perceval in 1812;[70] celebrations took place in Glasgow, Brixton, Liverpool, Bristol, Leeds, Belfast, Cardiff and elsewhere;[71][72][73][74][75] Glasgow City Council advised citizens to stay away from street parties organised without their involvement or consent out of safety concerns.[76][77] A larger demonstration with around 3,000 protesters took place at Trafalgar Square in London on 13 April.[78][79][80][81] Graffiti was posted calling for her to ""rot in hell"".[57][82][83] Left-wing director Ken Loach suggested privatising her funeral and tendering it for the cheapest bid.[84] The Daily Telegraph website closed comments on all articles related to her death due to brigading by online trolls.[85]

1) You simply don't do that in populated places. Let me tell you a true story... once upon a time in 1971, in a country called USSR, near a small island in a salt water lake in the middle of a desert, 10 people got the smallpox (the real thing, and not a mild version either - they got an enhanced version).

You can read the story here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Aral_smallpox_incident

Lesson: when you play with fire, you play far away from flammables. If China does that kind of shit, they don't do that in cities. Maybe somewhere in the Gobi or Taklamakan desert.

2) When you play with fire, and suddenly everything burns, you immediately extinguish. You instantly react because you know what you did. In the Aral smallpox incident, massive and instant reaction by Soviet authorities ensued, 50 000 people vaccinated... 3 died. They didn't spend time twiddling thumbs, because they had caused it and knew.

A delayed response, with the wheels of bureaucracy refusing to turn at all first... officials worrying about festivals getting canceled... giving a disease a full month of free reign (or even more), that is consistent with genuine surprise.

Sure it generates random activity, but there comes a time when you have to take the same amount + interests out of your economy... Now you have broke hookers instead of a new steel forming tool generating continuos growth for the next 20 years. 

&gt;The weird notion is that debt is somehow a sin, and people should suffer for it, even if alternatives exist.

If it didn't generate growth someone has to suffer eventually, your kid's generation or the pension funds when you default on your debt.

728,"Recreational marijuana generally smells more ""dank"" and has more of the stereotypical ""high""; medical marijuana has higher percentages of CBD and provides more pain relief, but doesn't get you as high.

Most decent rec strains (indica or sativa) have anywhere from ~25% to as much as 70-80% THC (the higher the THC percentage, the more ""powerful"" and expensive it is). Additionally, stronger strains will raise your tolerance because the THC binds to your receptors for several days, so you need to smoke *more* to get the same level of high. That's why tolerance breaks are a thing

Medical marijuana (at least here) usually has about the same percentage of CBD in addition to THC; and a lot of them have hardly any THC (like 2-4%). Recreational marijuana usually has next to no CBD (less than a fraction of a percent) unless you specifically request high CBD strains.


And keep in mind CBD must be taken with some level of THC to take advantage of it's benefits; CBD by itself doesn't really do much.","US, corporate oligarchy",/r/europe/comments/g5hxpx/europe_gets_more_tourists_than_the_rest_of_the/fo4gqu4/,real_sadboi,1587504120

738,"&gt; Your comment points to the central weakness of the entire post: Its refusal to appreciate the beneficial disciplinary role of financial markets in assessing the attitudes and conduct of societies and politicians.

You know what the financial markets like? Using monetary flexibility to support economic performance. Because making doctors more expensive doesn't repay debt; a healthy workforce does. The financial markets prefer to err on the side of a little inflation.

This crisis is happening anyway, and we will have to deal with the aftermath. There is no moral hazard in raising money to deal with this crisis by use of Eurobonds.

&gt;What would rather be needed is a persistent, thorough discussion on how to improve the long-term growth potential of the Italian economy, starting with establishing the level of trust that induces a higher share of private savings and investment (at the cost of current consumption).

One aspect is the death grip of the establishment on lucrative positions, offices, and property, there is room for improvement. Then again, Italy is still the 8th-12th (depending on the metric) largest economy in the world, producing many high value exports. Implying that Italy is economically competent reeks of prejudice. Italy's main problem at this point is the crippling interest burden. It's a vicious cycle, and that won't break by itself, because the financial markets only deal with their own short term benefit.

But again, either way, this is not relevant to the covid-19 crisis, and there is no moral hazard in using eurobonds for emergency measures. There is, however, moral hazard in telling Italy ""Yeah Mario, I think your grandmother should die because you are lazy, even though I can easily prevent that at no cost to myself.""",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/g5ag54/a_few_thoughts_about_the_italian_public_debt/fo4gz5f/,silverionmox,1587504241

761,"&gt;You say this like it's fact, and simple. Federalisation of the EU is hugely controversial and opposed by many. You think southern Europe will agree to harmonized retirement ages? You think northern Europe will agree to ceding their national tax revenue and credit ratings to other countries? You think the EU-27 will agree to major EU-level taxes (income, VAT, corporate)? It is pure fantasy.

We can have the discussion, the high level agreement will be shot down, and then we'll arrive at some intermediate compromise that is said to be impossible right now. That's how it usually goes.

&gt;The most likely thing to happen in the near future is a financial crisis in Italy, Spain, and the like. What happens from there is unclear. But look at the last time such a situation occured last decade with Greece. What was the result? Crushing austerity and calls to kick Greece out of the Euro instead of ""bailing them out"". Hard to imagine things don't unfold the same this time, economic consequences be damned.

But it's exactly the same political thought that called for crushing austerity and is now calling to reject eurobonds.

One thing is certain, if the austerity faction wants total control of a country's economy, they also need to be totally responsible for all its expenses.

&gt;We are too different in language, culture, and identity for such a unified political structure. You only have to look at the administrative clusterfuck that is Belgium to see that.

I just don't understand why people think the the identity of a Pole or a Bangladeshi is so flimsy that they would be assimilated within few years or a generation or so. 

I mean look at the Irish. They lived under English rule for centuries, Irish soldiers fought for the Crown, Irish artists added to British culture, some of the finest people the Irish produced were patriotic subjects of the Crown and the Irish even adopted the English language. 

Yet call an Irishman English, and see what happens. If we judge the Irish by the standards of assimilation set today for immigrants, they would be a stellar example.

But the Irish kept their identity to this day. If England in the peak of her cultural vigour and might couldn't assimilate the Irish, how would they ever make Englishmen out of Yoruba, Punjabis and Poles when their culture is in obvious decline?  Many of these people have their own rich and proud traditions and identity.

834,"&gt;Deporting children was humane thing to do tho. Would you prefer they essentially abducted them from their parents and placed with Polish families or into orphanages?

I wouldnt have expelled their parents either. But i am not blaming the polish for this i blame the sovjets who forced this plan through (it wasnt in line with the democratically chosen polish government in exile. if im right the polish pm plan was to assimilate the germans in small areas around the border not to expell 10 million germans). And besides blame is useless only acknowledgement can be usefull now. The thing is here you are telling me how well deserved it was even though it was random. People from neurnburg didnt get expelled even though it had one of the biggest nazi party support there. The real nazis who didnt get trialed never suffered from these actions because they always had the means (money) to make a new life wherever they wished. In another part of germany or abroad. But the people who suffered from these actions are the poorer ones. Not only the sheeps but also apolitical ones the women the children and everybody else. Hundreds of thousands(edit: according to wikipedia 500.000 to 2.5 million people so adoption would be more human although not realistic) germans died from this and again those are the widows and the young children not the ones with the crimes on their names. And you could say you should punish the people who look away. But what can you do if you dont agree with genocide or other crimes against humanity, call it out and you get send to a concetration camp. People and not only nazi supporters will always look away if it can safe themselves. Thats a human trait because it saves people lives. I dont imagine many people favoured communism in Poland but what can you do when your neighbours get send to siberia? The same logic can be applied to many individuals in germany.

That way you don't have to worry the parade has to be cancelled because of a few people and you are not enabling open anti-Semitism. As long as the city can't be bothered to do that, it is going to look like it doesn't care enough about standing up to anti-Semitism.

Joking about stereotypes is one thing. Joking about stereotypes that are associated with racial theories that were used to justify genocide on an industrial scale less than a century ago is something completely different. And I am not even talking about the people wearing badges that were basically used to mark innocent people for execution based on their ethnicity.

&gt; Reddit enables racists, bigots and anti semites as well and yet you're still using it... 

This is isn't the same at all and you know it. There are subreddits where that kind of stuff is common, but that is no different from real-life neonazi organizations. Those people already strongly believe in those things. When those neonazis go to other normal subs and spout that nonsense they are called out for it, which isn't happening with this parade.

1011,"No, visible light and certainly infrared are not carcinogenic, not ionizing, but still dangerous, that's the point. For visible light it's because it destroys molecular bonds, for infrared it's probably a thermal effect.

&gt; because it is literally impossible for either frequency to have any impact on your cells whatsoever, let alone cause damage

That's the entire point, you didn't prove any of this. It's easy to prove that it's not ionizing, but there might be other mechanisms by which harm is effected. However

&gt; By all means, something exposed to 30Ghz will heat up something faster than 1 Ghz

That's only because 30GHz is better absorbed, not because it's inherently higher energetic. How fast something heats up is mostly a question of the absorbed power, not the frequency.

&gt; ... and no it doesn't, and this is why you stop consulting Wikipedia. That radiofrequency electromagnetic fields could theoretically be carcinogenic isn't impossible at a certain frequency but, again, there is frequency, and there is FREQUENCY. 30Ghz can not be dangerous to you, neither can any of the other commercial standards that measure just 1Ghz... So this is literally far-fetched bullshit.

I could link directly to the source if that makes you happy: https://monographs.iarc.fr/list-of-classifications Radiofrequency electromagnetic fields are in there. No, the difference in frequency is not the point, radiofrequency at no point includes a frequency range that's ionizing, or even capable of upsetting molecular bonds. It's an admission of our ignorance of all effects other than thermal or ionizing, and [some preliminary experimental evidence](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/em.22343). Sure, those rats experienced way higher cellphone radiation levels than humans ever would, so it's no reason to torch 5G poles, but it does imply your statement of ""objectively wrong beyond doubt"" was a little hasty.

&gt; That doesn't mean that things aren't going to be researched. Large parts of science concern explaining things already apparent to idiots. It would require that we have some complete misunderstanding of how physics works right now for 5G to be dangerous in any way whatsoever.

This has nothing to do with physics. Again, there are other possible means of harm, that you cannot at the outset disprove.

But I'm very happy you mention research because indeed, [people are doing research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK208983/), and the possibility of non-thermal effects **is under active investigation**.

1025,"&gt; But that's not how tax havens work. What Ireland is doing is attracting foreign firms with its low rate and getting money from production that is not on its territory.  
&gt;  
&gt;Germany, Italy, France etc. can probably aim to what you described, but not attract foreign companies in the same way.

So what? We can extrapolate your argument a bit further on the reason why companies from Germany or Italy have cheap production sites in Eastern Europe, but sell most of its production back home... Another example: Néstle, a Swiss-native company which 99% of its profits come from abroad. 

The low tax rates in Ireland are for LOCAL and FOREIGN companies, there is no distinction. By the way, I think I remember reading somewhere that the loss in taxes that Italy and Germany have because of Ireland is barely in the region of 10 billion. I will need to confirm this number though...

What I think that , respectfully, that you are wrong is that you are focusing on the problems of other contries' tax havens and not on Italy's fiscal problems, bureaucracy, and lack of competitiveness.

600,000 Stockholmers have had coronavirus, believes Johan Giesecke, infection control expert and adviser to WHO.

At the same time, he claims that 99 percent of those infected don't know about it.

- Then there are some who get sick, some seriously ill and some die, he says in SVT Morgonstudion.

Sweden today has just under 15,000 confirmed cases in the country. 5,992 of them live in the Stockholm region.

But the dark figure is believed to be large. According to a study presented yesterday, 11 percent of Stockholmers have developed antibodies to covid-19.

- 600,000 Stockholmers have had it, says Johan Giesecke in the Morning Studio.

SVT: And many do not know that they had it?

- 99 percent or more do not know that they had it, the infection protection expert responds.

- Those who are infected do not notice that they have had it. Then there are some who get sick, some seriously ill and some die. But if you look at everyone who is infected, it is a very small proportion.

At the same time, the Stockholm region will now expand its testing. According to SVT News, the region is taking power to test significantly more than before, says SVT News.

So far, about 5000 people have been tested per week. When Region Stockholm has now fixed the lack of the number of test kits and mechanical equipment, you will be able to test 5000 every day.

- The antibody tests we are now using are of very high quality and we can use them for both health and research purposes. We want to test if those who have been ill developed antibodies to covid-19, and then be able to continue to analyze and evaluate the results for research purposes, says Claes Ruth, acting head of the Karolinska University Laboratory, to SVT News.

Sampling should be carried out both to see if you are carrying the virus right now and if you have been carrying the virus. In addition to the 5000 tests to be performed each day, 2000 antibody tests should be performed each week.

Yes, but you can't punish thought crimes. Only actions should be punishable.

&gt;Exactly, because there is an ideological spectrum that the state allows - this is just a basic fact of life. Try advocating for a Classical era Greek pedophilia direct democracy - this will inevitably lead to some sort of state persecution in most countries

Exactly, because most states don't value freedom of speech. I think that's a mistake.

&gt; In this case the state has already ignored freedom of speech, has it not? 

No, because they didn't punish him for advocating for nepotism, they just investigated him if he has done any misdeeds. Again, I don't mind punishing someone if he has **done** something.

&gt;There is no absolute free speech anywhere in the world

Has the wolf come back to Normandy? 

It is highly likely after the observation of an animal that strongly resembles a wolf in the “Pays de Bray” area in the east of Normandy, a dozen or so kilometres from Picardie. 

David Desjardins, from Londinières alerted the French biodiversity office (the public office in charge of wolf population surveillance) after having photographed something which looked like a wolf with a movement activated camera. The picture was taken on the 8th of April at 0150.

A grey wolf?

From the photos sent by David Desjardins, experts from the OFB confirmed that the animal in the photo was very probably a grey wolf (Canis lupus lupus). The prefecture of Seine-Maritime have taken the matter very seriously but are nevertheless more sceptical “considering that many breeds of dogs can be of a similar size and have a similar shade of coat to that of a wolf, the expert opinion is to be considered with some scepticism.”

“if this really is the first sighting in more than a century, the species is known for its ability to disperse widely. Therefore, since the return of the wolf to France in the maritime alps in 1992 the species has returned in the mountainous regions of France. The species is regularly seen in territories far from these regions like; Indre, Eure-et-Loire, Somme or Charente-Maritime.”",,/r/europe/comments/g5cgrw/a_large_canine_has_been_captured_by_an_automatic/fo2vx5v/,FrothyPeach96,1587475361

(chances which are anyway just 0%, can't get lower, italy has less chances of defaulting than any other european nation, but just in case you like to assume the chances are higher)  
  
The first moral hazard, the one currently inflating the divide of interest rates of the national debts among european nations.  
  
Resolve an already existing moral hazard, before worrying about an hypothetical future one. Sometimes things fall into place, and presumed moral hazards stop being an issue, once the underlying causes of them are settled.  
  
Answering directly, the only realistic way for italy to default on national debt (which again, it's 0% chance) is because of interest rates too high to be paid back.  
With eurobonds, for its interest rates to go so high to be not possible to be paid back, it's less of an italian issue but an european issue. So long the interest rates are reasonable, it's impossible for italy to default.

1261,"&gt; You are making them easy targets for state propaganda

we live in a time of the internet and there is plenty of information out there, maybe lets stop making excuses for purposeful behavior. And lets also be fair and acknowledge there is also a lot of Russians who live here and who are loyal and patriotic about this country. 

Many who are these still very pro-Kremlin ones are like that because they just want to, they are not little poor victims. Its a choice. You can integrate into the society and accept that you are like everyone else here, or you can stay a outcast who plots his revenge against everyone hoping mother Russia comes back and puts you back into the privileged position your people once had here (which is how it was when USSR was around, Russian people were put above local Balts and many especially former military folks are romanticizing that part in particular, its not the ''culture'' they crave, its its former position of power). No amount of explaining and tolerance will change that, because its a view that is directly oppose to a Western World/democratic/liberal model in its core . 

What kind of compromise can you make with a person who romanticizes an oppressive dictatorship that ruled through iron first and purposely selected group of ethnic group that was above everyone else, while living a democratic liberal country?

 [**Hans van Leeuwen**]

*Europe correspondent*Apr 21, 2020 – 2.48am  
 

*London* | [China's coronavirus propaganda effort] in Europe has been pushed onto the defensive, as politicians, press and the public gradually turn against Beijing over its [perceived culpability] for the COVID-19 pandemic.

French Foreign Minister Yves Le Drian was the latest European to take a pop at Beijing, angrily rejecting China's ""calumnies"" and accusing President Xi Jinping's regime of fomenting divisions on the Continent.

His public foray late on Monday (AEST) will be seen as a boost to [the US and Australian push] to hold China accountable for how it has handled the COVID-19 outbreak, following Foreign Minister Marise Payne's call on Sunday for an international probe into Beijing's conduct.

China has been [trying to recast itself] as the country that has successfully beaten the pandemic and can help others to do so, portraying itself as the altruistic hero rather than the cover-up villain.

 But its diplomats in Europe have increasingly been pulled into ugly and unedifying spats with politicians and the media, and opinion polling in Britain suggests the public wants to see China held to account. 

Mr Le Drian was responding to a furiously worded open letter, published on the website of China's embassy in France, which anonymously accused Western governments of removing staff from nursing homes and leaving residents to die unattended.

""I cannot accept that the staff of our nursing homes is slandered by anyone, including by the Chinese embassy,"" Mr Le Drian told *Le Monde* newspaper in an interview published on Monday.

The offending Chinese letter was later footnoted to make the accusations more general rather than France-specific; and the French ambassador in Paris has since issued an emollient statement welcoming the two countries' cooperation over the pandemic.

French president Emmanuel Macron also used a weekend interview with the *Financial Times* to question China's handling of the crisis, saying things had ""happened that we don't know about"".

## 'Trojan horse'

In Britain, Sky News and several tabloids have reported that British intelligence agencies have joined a US investigation into the origins of COVID-19 and the role of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

The news came as a Survation poll of 1000 Britons found that more than 80 per cent of respondents would back an international inquiry into China's handling of its coronavirus outbreak.

The Henry Jackson Society, a London-based think tank with a hawkish line on China, said the survey, which it released on Monday, also found 71 per cent support for a British or multinational effort to sue China for damages if it was found to have broken international law.

Meanwhile, Germany's biggest-selling tabloid newspaper *Bild* has picked a fight with China's Berlin embassy, publishing an itemised €150 billion ($257 billion) ""invoice"" to China for the cost of the German COVID-19 outbreak.

The embassy wrote an open letter to Bild's editor-in-chief slamming the article as ""infamous"", and accusing the newspaper of ""nationalism, prejudice and xenophobia"".

""Germany has to revise its contingency plan, which was well thought out at the time ... In the meantime, well-known international scientists also confirm that China's swift and decisive action has made an important contribution to containing this pandemic,"" the letter said.

The *Bild* editor wrote back in a letter that upped the ante with an emotive attack on China's political system and practices. He called China's [provision of face masks] to afflicted European countries ""a Trojan horse"".",,/r/europe/comments/g567d2/china_forced_onto_the_defensive_against_european/fo28y6e/,johnruby,1587453586

That's interesting, because in Helsinki things seem to have happened differently. It was made the capital of the Grand-Duchy in 1812, and an architect named Engel, who had been educated in St.Petersburg, was sent to design a modern city center. The result was [very neoclassical](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Senate_Square_-_Senaatintori_-_Senatstorget%2C_Helsinki%2C_Finland.jpg/2880px-Senate_Square_-_Senaatintori_-_Senatstorget%2C_Helsinki%2C_Finland.jpg). In the mid-19th century [neogothic style](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Ritarihuone%2C_Helsinki_01.jpg/1920px-Ritarihuone%2C_Helsinki_01.jpg) was quite popular, but in the 1890's it was replaced by [Jugendstil](https://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload//w_1199,h_1500,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto:eco/13-3-9787707.jpg) and [National Romanticism](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Helsinki_Kansallismuseo_2006.jpg/1200px-Helsinki_Kansallismuseo_2006.jpg) were in vogue. In the 1920s we also had a bit of a classicist revival, for example [the parliament](https://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload//w_1198,h_899,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto:eco/13-3-10752585.jpg) was built own this style, but then [functionalism](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Paimio_Sanatorium2.jpg) became the dominant style.

1439,"''What do you want to say with this? ''

I am saying Northern countries,germany for example knew very well who they were letting in the euro,i fail to see how you can deny this. 

'' And what evil plan did they had in mind?''

No evil plan,just same way you say Greek government were inept and corrupt same way your own governments for reasons that benefited them decided to let certain southern countries enter the euro despite knowing full well that they do not meet the qualifications needed. 

The measures taken for Greece's economic adjustment program are comparable to WW1 measure's taken in Germany back in the day....which we all know how it worked out.

Not even that one of the biggest tragedies aside the extreme poverty(which saw the biggest rise in eu and is on par with countries like romania),  here is that in a country of 10 mil we have  500.000 skilled workers/scientists(aged 25-44) leave the country,brain drain.The situation prolly wont change since we are bound till 2060 i think on certain conditions.I think you cannot seem to grasp what the situation is here.

If help comes in the form of loans similar to previous years i do not see how Greece can go on,at some point you will have to face reality. I do not think corona bonds are needed nor that something like that would be realistic to happen. 

I also do not think Germany has paid under other people's condition so far,at least not to Greece,on the contrary Greece was given loans under Germany's condition no matter the cost.I understand why you would be against corona bonds, but i also understand why other countries would not want ''help'' through some EU mechanism like ESM,considering what happened in Greece,they are afraid of the ''conditions''

Basically you complain for being called grandchilds of Hitler but from the south's perspective we are tired of being called lazy,pigs,that are the root of all problems in the eu because we want free money and do not work. 

I think its fair to blame our past policies and we are in major responsible for our situation but is this about playing the blame game or actually trying to find solutions? 
 If certain policies do not work (and according to a high ranking german politician they are similar to torture,what was he even thinking saying this) who will be held accountable? Noone because the lazy greeks deserve it.

If euro is to survive the more action is needed i am not sure corona bonds is the way to go,but i do think for some countries euro will just not be viable  if enough measures are not taken.

1454,"I think your comment is quite unfair for a number of reasons, most importantly that you are throwing in multiple very different countries into a pot - and then seem to talk exclusively about Italy.

Both Portugal and Spain implemented harsh austerity measures and were able to substantially reduce their debt burden. - It looks less impressive in a debt/gdp graph, because GDP was shrinking. Reducing public debt while the economy is shrinking is especially hard - and economically controversial - but they did it. 

Italy never received a bailout, they have consistently been a net contributor to the EU. Your point about a deficient administration and tax morale makes sense if you just compare them to the few countries that do substantially better - in a global context Italy is doing well. 

If you look at Italys debt development - the problem comes from the 80s, when debt ballooned like crazy on high interest rates. Italians are still paying for that today. - That was 35 years ago, two generations of Italians never had anything to do with it. If Italy was able to get *low interest* loans to replace the high interest ones, they would actually be running a surplus. 

A strong Italy is essential to the european project, so we definetely *should* find a mechanism where they can borrow cheaply for the next year or two.",,/r/europe/comments/g4xktk/merkel_backs_eu_bonds_to_fight_coronavirus_crisis/fo29abj/,antwille,1587453916

I have watched EU political developments for almost 30 years now, and nowhere do I see Germany acting like that. The euro was not intended as a power project for Germany and in my view they were pretty reluctant to enter. The fact that the euro is now giving Germany so much power is mostly a byproduct of 2 things: Germany's size and it's economic recovery after the Hartz reforms by Schroder. You don't want to bring down Germany as an economic powerhouse, and there is nothing you can do about it's size. So it is inevitable in it's current format that Germany is a dominating factor. 

You could blame Germany for being too self-absorbed, but then you could probably blame every bigger country on that aspect, I see a similar level in Italy and France and only slightly less in Spain.

For France I find it more difficult to answer the question if the EU is a powergrab. French politics seems more opague to me from the outside. So I don't know.",,/r/europe/comments/g4xktk/merkel_backs_eu_bonds_to_fight_coronavirus_crisis/fo22ihz/,GrandAdmiralSnackbar,1587447761

&gt;abject failure, misery, mass murder, starvation, and chronic political dysfunction and corruption all on catastrophic scales

Ah yes things that famously never happen under capitalism.


&gt;In the best of time under communism, people waited in long lines fir hours or days for bread, sometime not getting any.

These Things certainly did not happen under communism as communism, almost by definition, has not been implemented yet. It was the stated end goal of some socialist governments but it was never achieved.

However I think what you meant is what happened in some self identified socialist governments. While it is true that there were these bread lines during famines unless you want to claim that famines just don't happen under capitalism this is a completely irrelevant argument. But it gets even worse, in capitalism there even are bread lines when there is _no_ famine you just choose to call them something else.


&gt;In even the worst times in capitalism, the food is still there waiting for us

Dude living in the global north you have no idea what the worst times in capitalism look like. This must be the single most ignorant and privileged thing I've read all year.


&gt;as long as we remember that people are self interested and will never not be self interested, and to deny that means death and misery on a terrifying scale.

&gt; The Washington Post newspaper has reported information obtained from diplomatic cables.
&gt;They show that, in 2018, US science diplomats were sent on repeated visits to a Chinese research facility. Officials sent two warnings to Washington about inadequate safety at the lab.
The column says the officials were worried about safety and management weaknesses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and called for more help.

&gt;It also claims diplomats were concerned the lab's research on bat coronaviruses could risk a new Sars-like pandemic. The newspaper says the cables fuelled more recent discussions in the US government about whether the WIV or another lab in Wuhan could have been the source of the virus behind the current pandemic.

It's not like you pay more in taxes than your income. When your salary increases, you will *always* get more money in your own pocket, no matter the tax rate. 

It's almost as if some people think that their salary is *their money*. It's not, and it never was. Part of it simply belongs to the community and never belonged to you. You never pay taxes from your own money. You just transfer the money you borrowed and which really belonged to the community all along, from the moment the money was released from the employer. 

And the higher your salary, the less you even need more money. According to research, you don't need more than around €40,000 per year to be as happy as you can as a human being. Taking more money from the community than that is a waste of resources. It doesn't increase human happiness; not even in the individual taking the money.

1773,"Where do I say that the Greek people did not show commitment to solve the crisis? 

My reaction to the first post of MrAlagos -

""Lecturing southern countries hasn't gotten northern countries anywhere either, because they never truly wanted them to solve their problems as in working alone on their issues, they only wanted them to do what is advantageous for the northern."" 

\- was about the situation that led to the high debt and the quasi default in the 2008 crisis.

Where do I say that corruption and tax evasion is only happening in Greece? 

It seems you are trolling. Greece got cheaper money with its entry into the Euro Group. That is what I said in my post. 

""But we also understand the Northern ''innocent'' countries and the world saint bankers knew what was going on and how some countries like Greece entered the euro,wish we never had joined the euro that 7-8 years from 2001-2009 were prolly gonna have to pay for decades to come.""

What do you want to say with this?  Well, we all know that Goldmann Sachs , J.P. Morgan definitely knew of it. 

So the Nothern ""innocent"" countries knew of it? And what evil plan did they had in mind? Was the crisis in 2008, the bailouts all part of a long devious plot?

Regarding the biggest tax evader you mean Hochtief. It was the company I found in many english speaking greek websites after your suggestion . Not so much anywhere else. 

Maybe because an international court ruled the VAT claims of the greek government where against the contract made with Hochtief.

Right know there are about 13Mill people in germany classified as poor, following the crisis and the bailouts. Nearly 20% of german workers are struggling to make ends meet, working full-time and still do not have enough for a living.

And now they are called Hitlers Grandchilds, the Evil Germans. And at the same time they are told to pay even more money but the should not pay the money under their own conditions, no they should pay it the way the asking party prefers.

1791,"&gt; On January 3rd the Portuguese Health Organization chief was telling the Portuguese people there was nothing to worry about because according to the WHO this new coronavirus wasn't transmissible among humans

That was the available information at the time. This is so fundamentally nonsense that it isn't even wrong. 

People aren't omniscient. We obtain knowledge of facts gradually and as a function of discovery, not in a sudden and complete epiphany the moment they obtain. If I asked you right now if there was a Zombie plague in Portugal, you'd say ""no"", and maybe there's already 100 zombies creeping about and *you just don't know yet*. 

And maybe later you'd say ""We've contained this, they all are wearing muzzles and can't bite you"", and then it turns out that actually zombie-ism is transmitted by the evil eye, too, but *you just don't know that yet*. And even later it turns out that biting has nothing whatever to 
with zombie transmission, and it turns out you were just *wrong*, but you didn't know that then. 

Covid-19 is like that. What's more, epistemology is like that. We have no better way to obtain empirical knowledge than by noting something, making hypothesis, testing, and refining. It's in principle like that for *everything, ever*. 

Now

&gt;  I don't see how I'm lying or ignorant.

&gt;&gt; In January the WHO believed this virus wasn't transmitted among humans because that was what China was reporting

January includes dates after January 3rd. The WHO reported human-to-human transmission before February.

&gt; The problem is that they were at least on the hundreds when a doctor first publicly rang the bell

1947,"Many of the richest people associated with the Brexit campaign were in the Paradise Papers leak due to their offshore tax haven use, the same people very vocal about going for a hard Brexit post vote and looking to change the rules.

Aaron Banks donated £8.5m to the leave camp and is in favour of a hard Brexit, he has money and tax avoidance (legal) schemes running between Isle of Man and his Gibraltar based holding firm. The Barclay brothers, owners of the Telegraph and 3 of the poshest London hotels are based on the island of Brecqhou and Monaco whose income is all shielded behind tax havens, they donated £1.5m to the Tories. Robert Edminston, a former Tory peer who donated hundreds of thousands to the leave camp and indirectly, via his firms, gave £4.5m to the Tories. Again, uses tax havens and has firms registered in Malta and BVI. Rees-Mogg uses BVI, Cayman Islands and Singapore locations to keep income out of UK tax.

These are people funding the Tories, they are in favour of a hard Brexit and less EU involvement in British affairs. They don't donate this money because they're feeling generous, they want something in return. Loopholes to keep tax out of the coffers for example.

Go back to 2015, the Tories, the DUP and UKIP MEPs all voted against EU tax avoidance plans. David Cameron wrote to the EU personally to ask that offshore trusts be excluded from the EU targets. Phillip Hammond, when chancellor, talked of Britain becoming a ""Singapore-on-Thames"" model, his successor, Sajid Javid, who has worked as a banker in Singapore, talked up tax cuts and deregulation as part of his ""show and awe strategy"" for the post Brexit economy. The UK has rolled back the requirement for offshore territories to adopt transparency (such as benefit interests of firms being publicly listed)


Is any of that a smoking gun? No. 
Does it have some foundation that some in the Tory party, and in particular, vocal parts of the leave campaign, are putting a lot of money into trying to get as far away from the EU as possible and have vested interests in hiding their financial affairs and would benefit from allowing tax avoidance to continue against the aims of the EU tax avoidance schemes?

2003,"&gt;I think the russians are pro coronabonds

That makes no sense.

Without Eurobonds or a similar situation, with each country trying to finance by itself in colossal amounts at the same time, confidence doubts in the ability of Italy and some other countries to not be able to repay their debt commitments (especially as investors might flock to safer countries) might cause interest rates to soar far beyond what repayable interest rates are (as happened with Greece and Portugal for instance), which would cause those countries to go bankrupt, bringing down their economies and other European economies most close to them, overtime destroying the whole European economy and the EU project itself.

Russia would like nothing more than for the EU to shatter and fragment into a thousand bits and for the EU economies to significantly weaken vis-a-vis themselves.

The Eurobonds or similar situation, allows for EU economies to finance themselves on the market based on their pooled strength, allowing for every European government to restart their economy without fears of collapse. Politically, it allows moderate Pro-EU governments to show to their electors that they are able to effect change in the midst of the EU, and curtail the discourse by Anti-EU populist parties that the EU only serves to keep their respective countries down.

That is absolutely the opposite of what the Russian regime wants.

The ideal situation for Russia would be for the EU to break apart as Southern and Northern European countries throw accusations at each other in a Götterdämmerung that leaves the European nations in tatters, divided and hostile to each other, and far more amiable to closing their eyes to everything that the current EU Member-States are sanctioning Russia for.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/g4xktk/merkel_backs_eu_bonds_to_fight_coronavirus_crisis/fo0cuu4/,Joltie,1587410548

After the age of exploration silk road lost it's relevance and this was the first blow for the Ottomans. Also with this age of exploration empires who expanded their wealth invested in new technologies and surpassed Ottomans in military technology, this made conquests too costly and way harder than before. This was the second blow. Europe continued it's advances on both social and technological fields, while Ottomans did not bother with that since they still saw themselves as a superior civilisation.

2120,"&gt; If you prevent dividends and stock buybacks, why would ANYONE invest in that company? I mean what the hell would be the point?

Ever heard of loans? Or interest rates?

&gt; It would kill the profit motive

The profit motive is about extracting money from a company. You can have profits without bleeding money off onto investors. Reinvest ffs.

&gt; I would bet my life savings that the country that did this would lose 50% of its GDP in the next decade

GDP is not determined by how much money investors make. It is (broadly speaking) determined by how much is consumed and exported. As such, it wouldn't even be a particularly bad thing if it fell. But it wouldn't, because the people do not buy less when they hold control over the economy. In fact, allowing the general populace to have more control over the economy results in more purchasing power, i.e. more consumption and thus a higher GDP.",,/r/europe/comments/g4pw4u/the_danish_parliament_passes_a_vote_that/fnzzc6p/,have_compassion,1587403366

Then they were forced to halt operations due to their fantasy of economy not corresponding with reality... And as such endangering the population.

But that was not the point I wanted to make. Corporations know the market can, and will, ""deflate"" once in a while. It's been doing that for about a hunderd years by now. Yet, every time it happens it's a ""new"" situation which nobody could have predicted. Except that it keeps happening, albeit for different reasons in each case. Corporations *could* prepare for that, but why would they if every time the same solution is applied: Bailout.

The cause differs, the problem remains, the solution enforces the problem. In 10 years, the market has crashed again due to... Massive breakdown of the internet (I dont know), maybe the government should start saving up in advance for the bailouts that will need to happen then.

2177,"&gt; Ever heard of loans? Or interest rates?

Yes. Ancient concepts. Funny thing, they never really kicked off dramatic economic growth, unlike the joint-stock company which was far more popular. This is really economic history 101.

With huge companies (or governments) with guaranteed revenues, loans are fine. With smaller and riskier ventures, they totally aren't.

&gt; The profit motive is about extracting money from a company. You can have profits without bleeding money off onto investors. Reinvest ffs.

That's not getting the money out! What the hell.

I will sell you a financial product for your pension today. I will only buy government bonds, and with all the interest you earn, I will buy more government bonds.

I'm just curious wtf will you do when someone asks you to pay a restaurant bill or something? ""Trust me, I own a lot of bonds?"" You. Need. Cash. 

The comparison is quite apt to government bonds that the government never intends to pay back. Why wouldn't you invest in those?

&gt; GDP is not determined by how much money investors make.

Yet level of investment in to new companies is basically the best leading indicator for GDP growth. If that drops by 90%+, it's not a great sign. Someone will have to take up that slack, and given everyone with actual money will be investing in foreign companies, it will have to be the government, and now you arrived in socialism through the backdoor basically. And your economy will be going downhill real, real soon.

&gt; As such, it wouldn't even be a particularly bad thing if it fell

You enjoy your dropping salary, that's your right.

&gt;  In fact, allowing the general populace to have more control over the economy results in more purchasing power, i.e. more consumption and thus a higher GDP.

""More"" control is one thing. You are banning the fucking profit motive. That's total control, and that experiment has been run nearly 50 times soon.

It. Always. Goes. To. Shit. There are zero success stories not outshone by their peers who allowed private investment to drive growth. We've even had that tested with the same people in Germany and Korea ffs.


My personal way to give people more power would be via a UBI tied to % of GDP. So in the US it'd start off at, say, 15% of GDP, giving every adult American $1k USD per month...

2220,"A silent army of Poles, Bulgarians and Belarusians ensures that the flow of goods does not stop even during the Corona crisis. Many of them are deprived of social standards and fair payment.

From the driver's cabin of the truck a stocky young man with short shaved hair and a chubby face, let's call him Fabian Wozniak, climbs out. It is Friday, the afternoon dawns, the wind is blowing over the motorway rest area on the Avus. Wozniak pushes his hands deep into his trouser pockets. Empty parking lots spread out around him, there are just three or four trucks here, and he drives one of them.

The young Pole is part of a huge market. Around 1.2 trillion euros are turned over in logistics throughout Europe every year; the industry ensures that the flow of goods to the warehouses, factories, supermarkets is uninterrupted, even in times of crisis. And to ensure that this costs as little as possible, many large companies commission subcontractors in Eastern Europe who offer their services at dumping prices.

In normal times, according to official statistics, around four out of ten trucks are registered on Germany's toll roads in Eastern Europe. But nothing is normal these days. The Corona crisis has brought large parts of the economy to a standstill, and orders for freight forwarders and freight logistics companies have also slumped dramatically. 

Fabian Wozniak therefore has the car park on Berlin's Avus almost to himself. For him, nothing has changed since the virus has been rampant in Europe. Since Monday he is back in Germany. He says he is always on the road for two weeks at a time. He loads, drives, delivers, drives on. At night he sleeps on a narrow folding couch that hangs over the seats in the truck's cabin. Most recently he has transported parcels for DHL, and coffee, which he delivers to Tchibo. He pulls a spray bottle of disinfectant from the compartment in the door, his only protection against the corona virus. ""Of course I'm scared,"" he says, ""like everybody else.""


His employer lets him shuttle to Germany in a minibus, and in the bus he and nine other drivers crowd together on their way from Poland to Frankfurt/Main. They sit close together for a good 700 kilometres, social distancing is different. But staying at home is not an option. One of his colleagues refused to go to Italy, says the Pole, who is now out of a job. Wozniak's monthly salary is 2800 zloty, the equivalent of just under 620 euros, plus expenses, about 1000 euros, which make up the bulk of his earnings - and he only receives this when he drives trucks abroad.

""The system is designed to break employee rights,"" says Michael Wahl, who works for the ""Fair Mobility"" consultancy project, an initiative of the German Trade Union Federation (DGB). On this day, he is at the rest area to inform truckers about their rights. He points to Wozniak's truck and says: ""The situation is clear, the employee is only employed in Germany. The subcontractor brings him here for work."" As he sees it, the Polish driver should therefore be entitled to the German minimum wage.

But the reality is different. As a rule, Eastern Europeans only receive the minimum wage of their home country, in Poland around 570 euros a month, in Bulgaria 280 euros. This is topped up in each case with expenses that are actually intended to cover meals for drivers on the road. Wahl says: ""This is the normal thing. There is no chance of fairly paid work for these people.""

Many companies in Germany commission forwarding agents in Eastern Europe: parcel services, mail order companies, practically the entire automotive industry. The DHL Group rejects criticism of the practice: DHL makes ""high demands"" on transport companies ""in line with its quality standards"" and obliges them to ""observe all legal regulations, including explicitly the minimum wage law"". However, the responsibility for the working conditions ""including the level of remuneration"" lies ""with the service partner and his responsibility as employer"". 

According to industry experts, it is hardly possible to cover the costs of driving below a price of 1.25 euros per kilometre and pay the drivers decently. But the prices are sometimes around 80 cents. And now, in the times of Covid-19, the price war on the motorways is coming to a head: on the freight exchanges the rates have dropped to 51 cents.

""We have to fight this social dumping as quickly as possible,"" says Dirk Engelhardt, head of the Federal Association of Road Haulage, Logistics and Waste Management (BGL). ""So that we have a situation after the crisis in which German small and medium-sized businesses can continue to exist.""

In the BGL are registered above all medium-sized companies that cannot keep up with the cheapest prices. But it is also true that many large German haulage companies have themselves set up branches in Eastern Europe in order to employ truckers at dumping wages.

The legal rule is that a truck from abroad may only make a maximum of three journeys in seven days in Germany before it has to return home. However, many trucks registered in Eastern Europe cross the German territory almost continuously, say experts and drivers. Violations of the statutory driving and rest periods also occur frequently. The Federal Office for Goods Transport (BAG) is responsible for supervision. The BAG inspected about 550,000 trucks in 2018. Around one million trucks are on the roads in Germany - every day.

The freight carriers calculated the fines, says Belgian police chief commissioner Raymond Lausberg, who has made a name for himself as a relentless opponent of exploitative companies. ""All the big players, all the big names, are playing in this rotten game. The bigger, the more outrageous."" He often meets truckers who have been living in miserable conditions in their trucks for months, sleeping in the cab, warming their food on gas stoves. ""It's frightening what we find at the controls.""

In Belgium, there is not enough capacity; and in Germany, practically nobody is looking. ""And where there's no control, there's no respect for the law."" The business is shifting further east, says Lausberg, the highway policeman. He now sees Polish drivers less frequently, as they are now too expensive. Instead, he more often meets Lithuanians, Ukrainians or even Kazakhs, some of whom are employed by letterbox companies.

Michael Wahl from the ""Fair Mobility"" project says he has already met Filipinos who were employed by a Polish haulage firm and transported washing machine parts on behalf of a German company. They had been on the road for 18 months - and had slept in their truck the whole time. An extreme case, says Wahl. And adds: ""Sometimes it's hard to say: Is this a catastrophic situation? Or is it normal?""

In his silver Ford Fiesta, he drives south on the A115, and parks the car at the Michendorf Nord rest area behind Potsdam. The parking lot lies still in the light of the evening sun. About a dozen blue trucks of the Lithuanian haulage company Vykom stand abandoned in a row, VW, Ford, Audi and BMW are among the company's customers. Name plates with Cyrillic letters and the national flag of Belarus are attached to the windshields. Where are the drivers now?

Michael Wahl says that the companies could dissolve their relationship with the subcontractors from one day to the next: ""The client from Germany does not have to take responsibility for the driver. Those who fall ill or stay at home due to a lack of orders receive at best the minimum wage or social benefits calculated on the basis of the basic salary. Drivers from non-EU countries run the risk of losing their residence permit if they are dismissed. In the worst case, they are left without any protection at all.

At the back of the parking lot there is a truck from the company Demotrans from Poland; a narrow woman in leggings and sneakers is strolling by, a Polish woman. She says that she is a truck driver in the third generation, she is proud of that. She is currently transporting parcels for Amazon. 

When Michael Wahl wants to hand her a business card, she flinches; for fear of the corona virus, she won't touch the piece of cardboard. She cannot afford to get sick. She is on the road with a colleague, usually they are on tour for three weeks. The two of them have many clients, next up is a tour for Hermes to Leipzig, from where they continue on to Italy.

Hermes does not answer the questions of the Berliner Zeitung. From Amazon it says: ""Our partners are obliged to comply with the applicable laws and the code of conduct for Amazon suppliers, which focuses on fair wages, social benefits, appropriate working hours and remuneration"". Amazon pays the supplier companies ""fair market prices that enable them to pay wages above the national minimum wage and achieve a positive margin"".",Brandenburg ,/r/europe/comments/g4ur7i/truckers_from_eastern_europe_fighting_for_survival/fnzl8i5/,BouaziziBurning,1587396209

The logic behind it is: ""If you are not willing to stop paying dividends to shareholders or buy back shares, then you do not deserve relief money.

2300,"&gt; How are share buybacks and dividends the only reason stocks are worth anything? That makes no sense.

That's fine, most people don't, so let me explain.

It's the UNDERLYING value of why you have shares or stocks. It's what drives the HUGE investors like pension funds, who want a steady cash flow so they can pay things out to the pensioners they owe money to.

This is what so called ""blue chip"" stocks were always great for, because they paid extremely predictable dividends. The pension funds *love* that stuff, because it's the main way they get money to pay the pensions.

Think of it from another perspective: *where do you think company profits should go*?

The vast majority of company profits of the top 500 companies in the last 100 years have ultimately been paid out in dividends (stock buybacks are a more recent trend, but accomplish roughly the same with some good and bad sides) that have in turn been used to pay pensions.

If we didn't allow dividends and buybacks, those companies would now have the last 100 years of profits in some sort of Scrooge McDuck style vaults presumably.

&gt; You do that, by buying a share at a lower price than you sell it. 

You're forgetting why that share has any value to begin with.

Did you know you can buy and sell bonds too? Government ones.

What if Germany declared that it won't pay back those bonds. Do you think it'll be just fine on the bond resale market? No impact on the price of German treasuries?

My biggest problem is that if we agree with shared debt it will not be the last problem where the Northern countries are looked at to provide a financial solution. Only at that time ( due to shared debt) we will be truly facing MAD if we deny it and the Euro explodes. So at that we will be fully at the South’s mercy... Looking at the way Southern politicians play the blame game at this moment I truly dont want to be blackmailed into this position. And into an empowered EU with  a legalized transfer Union.

2477,"&gt;So your argument is that because the Normans integrated, who were French-speaking but from Denmark, who settled much of Ireland to the point where you can have maps showing the Norman and Celtic clans (with some Norman surnames being now amongst the oldest and most Irish of names)

They also conquered scilly are they germanic now. 

&gt;because apparently no Vikings settled (some did FYI. 

I didn't say none i said very few in literally 4 tiny outposts similiar to modern Gibraltar.

&gt;Did they all stay virgins?), you don't have Germanic ancestry? 

No but under arguement 9ger half Europe is descendants of charlemagne is everyone a frank?

&gt;You speak English primarily making you part of the Germanic language linguistic continuum regardless of why you speak it

Yeah but that doesn't make us a Germanic nation we speak English are we an English nation.

&gt;If we're talking ancestrally, a large amount of your heritage comes from people who who members of originally Germanic language-speaking tribes.


Again my arguement is  ot genetic its cultural iceland and england are not genetically Germanic either. The nation ireland however was founded by celts who didn't want to be Germanic. Every Germanic nation was founded by a Germanic people who wanted to be Germanic.

&gt;Culturally, you are whatever you want to be because cultural identity is a fiction we collectively create anyway,

Right so you have as much in common  with an unconnected tribe than another English person. If  not culture exsist.

&gt;these fictions exist because the British aristocracy i.e. the ones responsible for oppressing Ireland,

No it wasnt just the aristocracy by the time of the famine England was a democracy. The black and tans were sent by a democratic government.

&gt; to centre itself around something different, in this case, its Celtic heritage. 


No it was natural cause up to the famine Ireland spoke a Celtic language and the revival was only 20 years after the famine.

&gt;
However, the scientific reality is that the British aristocrats are not purebred Normans or Saxons, and neither are the Irish purebred Celts. 

I never said they were I just said they wernt Germanic.

I'm an American from New York, and I currently live in Vermont, which has a very, very strong sense of cultural identity, so much so that some people seemingly won't even consider you a Vermonter unless you've had a multi-generational lineage in the state. I could very much see someone with Vermonter parents moving to New York and then saying they're a Vermonter even though they're not really.

On the other hand, I'm also a German citizen. I've always felt somewhat ""insecure,"" for lack of a better word, about calling myself German though because I realize that even as someone who speaks German and is legally a German, I'm not German in the same way that someone who's born and raised in Germany is. By the same token, when I got my citizenship, the German in the office said that ""a German is a German.""

But my point here is that even as someone who speaks German very well, has lived in Germany, and is legally German, I feel strange calling myself German most of the time. It feels like faking it to some extent. When I talk with Americans who refer to themselves as German even though they can't speak a word of German and aren't citizens, I find it kind of strange. I'm not saying they can't do it or that they're wrong.

Together with increasing use of the internet and improving security standards, consumers appreciate the possibilities of being able to shop anytime, anywhere, with access to a wide range of products and easy price comparisons. During the current coronavirus pandemic, with high streets in lockdown and consumers under social distancing restrictions, e-commerce can be expected to grow further.

 60% of people in the EU aged 16 to 74 shopped online during the year prior to the 2019 survey, compared with 56% in the 2018 survey. Compared with 2009, the share of online shoppers had almost doubled from 32%.

 Men tend to shop online slightly more than women, with 61% of men and 59% of women shopping online. However, the share of online shoppers has increased more among women over the last 10 years (from 29% in 2009 to 59% in 2019) than among men (from 35% in 2009 to 61% in 2019).

Looking at the 2019 figures for the EU Member States, high shares of people who shopped online during the previous year were recorded in particular in the Scandinavian countries. The highest shares were found in Denmark (84%) and Sweden (82%), followed by the Netherlands (81%), Germany (79%) and Finland (73%). However, the highest increase over the last 10 years was in Estonia, with the share of online shoppers up 51 percentage points from 17% in 2009 to 68% in 2019. 

The share of online shoppers has increased substantially among all age groups over the last 10 years, in particular for the age groups between 16 and 54 years old. The highest share and the highest increase was among internet users aged 25 to 34 years (from 46% in 2009 to 79% in 2019), followed by the age groups 16 to 24 years (up from 41% to 73%), 35 to 44 years (up from 41% to 71%) and 45 to 54 years (up from 31% to 61%). The share of online shopper rose also in the group of persons aged 55 to 64 years,  from 19% in the 2009 survey to 45% in the 2019 survey, as well as for those aged 65 to 74 years (up from 8% to 28%).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/g4naag/online_shopping_in_the_eu_60_of_people_aged_16_to/fnygkxm/,filosoful,1587362457

But in Europe, people saying ""I'm Finnish/German/Italian"" literally mean that's their nationality or home country.

The only question is whether it goes up by a bit more (if Italy borrows the money itself) or if it goes up by a little bit less (if we get coronabonds). In any case, the debt load is going up. So logically, if Italy is already at the end of it's rope with regards to reforms, a higher debt load means even lower growth in the future. Which makes the prospect of lending them money very unattractive. Lend more money to a country that is already growing poorly due to the existing debt load, only to see growth go down further? Who would do such a thing. If a bank does it, it's called overcrediting and that is greatly frowned upon in general. 

Now of course you could say, maybe we can get growth up again. But how? It's not going to happen due to the debt load, because in either case, with or without coronabonds, it is already going up. At the same time Italy is refusing (by saying no the ESM) any meaningful reforms. So this is basically Italy giving up. They won't commit to reforms, they can't reduce their debt by austerity and they can't grow out of debt if their debt load continues to grow. Which is all very sad and tragic, but no reason to throw money into a black hole. 

Giving Italy coronabonds is just kicking the can down the road. It helps noone but the banks. Personally, I think Italy in the long run is better off by taking a haircut on it's debt, leave the Eurozone and try to come back with it's own currency, which should allow it to become more competitive with it's industry, which is pretty competent in northern Italy and hopefully tourism if they get a little cheaper compared to other tourist destinations. Greece should have done the same in 2010-2011. They don't need to leave the EU, that would probably negate any benefit for their industry because of all the border problems you can expect then, pushing them further down the hole.",,/r/europe/comments/g4g6hh/the_dutch_grumble_over_europes_coronavirus_cheque/fny9pru/,GrandAdmiralSnackbar,1587356950

The Horde was gradually Turkified and lost its Mongol identity, while the descendants of Batu's original Mongol warriors constituted the upper class.

&gt;In the 13th century, Wrocław was the political centre of the divided Polish kingdom.[22] In April 1241, during the First Mongol invasion of Poland the city was abandoned by its inhabitants and burnt down for strategic reasons. During the battles with the Mongols Wrocław Castle was successfully defended by Henry II the Pious

...

&gt; Legnica became famous for the battle that took place at Legnickie Pole near the city on 9 April 1241 during the First Mongol invasion of Poland. The Christian army of the Polish duke Henry II the Pious of Silesia, supported by feudal nobility, which included in addition to Poles, Bavarian miners and military orders and Czech troops, was decisively defeated by the Mongols.

&gt; After the war, nonetheless, the city was developing rapidly. In 1258 at the church of St. Peter, a parish school was established, probably the first of its kind in Poland.[13] Around 1278 a Dominican monastery was founded by Bolesław II the Horned,[13] who was buried there as the only monarch of Poland to be buried in Legnica.",eon,/r/europe/comments/g4fkyl/mongol_invasion_of_europe_12371242/fnx4uta/,Chrzaszczyrzewonszyc,1587331510

3129,"Quite the contrary. 

1. Although there were Jews in the Communist Party, anyone who wanted to be anyone joined it, since it was an easy way to kickstart your career.

2. Early in it's history the Polish People's Republic was very pro-Jewish, but it slowly changed, as during the '60 anti-Semitic tensions rose as Israeli-Arab conflict in the Middle East entered another phase. This all came to ahead when in the late 1967 student protests erupted around discontinuation of the viewings of adaptation of stage play ""Dziady"" they was deemed ""anti-Soviet"". Following that many students were expelled from Universities, among them two in particular: Adam Michnik (whose father was Ozjasz Szechter) and Henryk Szlajfer. Both of them were connected to political opposition inside the Party, and both of them were of Jewish descent. This resulted in massive wave of country-wide protests.

One one side was the opposition that tried to liberalize the country, and on the other you had the conservative, anti-Semitic Party hard-liners, that tried to utilize this incident to get rid of the current First Secretary.

In the end, after the protests of March '68, most of what little Jews still lived in Poland after WWII left the country for Israel.",,/r/europe/comments/g434w9/on_this_day_77_years_ago_jews_of_the_warsaw/fnx4vl9/,MateuszCh,1587331522

Unfortunately I'm not polish so I only read the abstract in english at the bottom, which doesn't say much one way or the other.

&gt; Cuba is also a shithole

lol ok that's a very convincing argument you've got there man. I can't take you seriously anymore because Cuba has a smaller child mortality rate than the US, more literacy and superior healthcare (This is very easy to look up). This is despite being under a trade embargo by its giant neighbor. I'm not even a proponent of a Cuban style of government, but they've been very effective and showed many other countries solidarity by sending doctors to help with the current Coronavirus crisis. They're the only country who let a coronavirus-hit british ship dock when everyone else refused. ""Cuba is a shit hole""? No offense but you seem very indoctrinated to be honest.

&gt;I know enough to know that communism is a flawed, outdated ideology

lol I highly doubt that you know anything that's not anti-communist propaganda, much less enough to make a judgement on it.

We don't actually live in purely capitalist societies. There are plenty of communist/socialist aspects and it's delusional to think it ""belongs in the garbage bin of history"". Does Universal healthcare belong in the garbage bin of history? Should we bring back child labor that communists pushed to abolish? Should we get rid of week-ends and vacations, the 8 hour work day, equal pay for women, women's rights, free public education etc. which without communists would never have happened? Should we get rid of open-source software? So communism is and will always be involved in some way in the organization of human society. It's delusional to think otherwise.

Also, equating Communism to Nazism is such an old and weak take lol. It betrays ignorance on the history of the 19th and 20th centuries. If you haven't noticed, Capitalism has *always* been an ally to Fascism and for most of us in Africa, capitalism is also an ideology with the blood of millions on its hands.

Basically, if in average 1000 people die in May in your country of 10M people but it suddenly grows to 2000 in May 2020 then you can (with some degree of statistical proof) say that C19 probably killed 1000 people during that month.

By tracking this ’extra’/outlier morbidity during C19 (and probably some time after, in order to internalize deaths caused indirectly by lockdowns, bad economy etc), you can then estimate how many people C19 *really* killed.
And that is all it matters really.

Tracking day to day numbers is just sampling noise.

So I also find it pointless to point fingers at some country and say ’you are doing it wrong!’ as no one knows what is right and there is just not enough data yet. We are all playing by the ear.

So whatever you do, do it well and stay rational! ;)

3251,"We also got a few ""Reichsbürger"" who believe germany isn’t a federal state but just a company owned by the U.S.A..

We all have idiots, but I think the biggest group aside from them are our old people. This is just some straight up idiots condensed into one area. Worse are our elderly because we have A: too much of them, and b: they are everywhere and the worst is: They straight up don’t care. 

Our Cafés have closed (obviously) and lately it got pretty chilly in the early mornings. But who is out on the street with a thermos bottle full of coffee and a few mugs, maybe some kind of small baked sweets? 

The elderly people. They literally gather in front of the caffee because „thats how they always done it since retirement“. 

Or our „medical center“. Before you even step into the building there is a note in **BIG RED LETTERS** about how you are not allowed to step in without some kind of protective mask. Even a scarf will suffice as we have a shortage of masks (and ofc some scalpers trying to make profit).

You’ll encounter this exact same note when waiting for the elevator, ***in*** the elevator, at the door of the floor(s) where you can enter the doctors office and a metric fuckton of them scattered around the entire counter where the staff is sitting behind ""anti spit-shielding“. Really!

And guess what who will enter the fucking building, the elevator, the doctors office and approach the counter only to **argue** about how they didn’t know that this is now a rule and how draconian it is.

Same thing at the grocery stores! Almost **all** of them require you to take a shopping cart, not just a basked, because they limited the amount of available carts to match the maximum amount of people allowed in the store and only a single person per cart is allowed. No groups. Also the length of a shopping cart is 1.5-2m and therefore an optimal ruler for the required safety distance. Now based of the things I wrote previously, who caused a public freakout because „she doesn’t want a stupid cart, she only needs her trusty trolley“ (little bag on wheels). The worst one had to be escorted out of the store by 2 bulky employees because she didn’t want to listen to reason.

&gt; Technology can't compete with dirt cheap labor in terms of cost though.

That has more to do with China being completely okay with child labour, toxic waste, and other kinds of pollution. Not so much with labour any more.

3301,"Oh, Berlin. What is Berlin? Berlin, as a city, brings nothing but shame to Germany on the international stage. When comparing Berlin with other European capitals such as London, Paris, Madrid and Amsterdam, any decent human’s face must blush in humiliation. Even small countries like Austria, Belgium or Switzerland have Vienna, Brussels and Zurich: presentable cities, complete with high standards of living. Germany gets punished with Berlin, capital of losers. In all the republic, Berlin is home to the largest number of arseholes by far. Deutsche Bahn, Bundestag, Air Berlin and Axel Springer are but a few examples of all the incompetent scum being kept here. Glorious times have long since passed, the city is face down in the dirt. Berliners are lazy sods to their very core. Traits that would, in any civilised culture, pass for nothing but laziness, rudeness, incompetence, dissocial personality disorder or idiocy, are taken by the Berliner and declared a way of life. That is why the Berliner harbours intense feelings of hatred for anyone who’s better than him in any way. Especially the all-around superior Southern Germany are a thorn in his side. He envies their success, and Munich makes the top on his list of hatred. That city is – and has! – everything that Berlin wants to be and have. Berliners take no interest in the fact that it is Munich that finances their dissolute lifestyle, in fact, they secretly believe that they have earned it. So instead of freeing themselves from their envious and resentful lethargy, instead of rolling up their sleeves and improve their city, they revel in their antisocial freeloading and praise their so-called global city. Culturally, Berliners are set up rather weakly, great works lie far back in history. Moreover, mispronouncing “g” as “j” is considered a great cultural feat. Advanced students have mastered ending each and every sentence with a “wa?”. The city’s culinary performance is second-rate. Here, a sausage made from glued-together, meaty odds and ends adorned with ketchup and curry powder is sold as a culinary masterpiece. Hardly any reasonable person would consider a bratwurst with ketchup a recipe, let alone the holy grail of culinary arts. Yet, in their magnanimity, the rest of the republic lets the Berliner keep his delusion, not wanting to amplify his inferiority complex. Economically, Berlin is an utter disaster, even the late GDR stood on more solid ground. The local economy is based around alternative blogs, something-something-media and, if universities are to be believed, gender studies. Disregarding his own bankruptcy, the Berliner treats himself to prestigious projects like the city palace and the airport – which, considering its inoperative nature, is likely an art installation. Moreover, the city houses all popular parties’ headquarters, who refrain from using “traitors” in their official names (Probably for marketing reasons). For the longest time, this “town’s” “mayor”, the jolly Wowibear, butchered anything he found left in a presentable state. Long story short: Berlin is Germany’s tiled coffee table. It is to Germany what Greece is to the European Union, and if it had open sewerage, it would be Germanys Romania. Berlin is a blemish, the abscess on the arse of the nation. Berlin is the uninvited party guest, who didn’t even bring any booze and wouldn’t even understand he’s not welcome if he had is teeth beaten out and got thrown down the stairs.

when there is in fact no reason for such a role.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course the basic facts of WW2 - that germany started it and all countries involved suffered, especially everyone east of germany - are clear and not the topic I want to discuss here.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am talking about is redrawing of borders and land grabing here.

And from that perspective Poland was just as eager to get what it could whenever it could, legitimate or not, and was thus not any different from all the other countries.

&amp;#x200B;

We could dial back the clock to any time you want and question any legitimacy of any claim.

800 years ago german Ostsiedlung marked the beginning of those areas (Slesia, Posen, Pommerania, Ostpreußen etc.) to be german and they remained so for 700 years. Now does 700 years legitimate a claim to those places? Or the fact that polish people lived there before?

&amp;#x200B;

You might argue the latter. And I find it ridiculous to not argue the first point of view. 700 years for god's sake. You might as well throw americans out of america because they are only living there for less than 400 years and are therefore not the rightful people there.

&amp;#x200B;

But it doesn't matter, the border are as they are, revisionism is stupid and Poland got excellent slices of the cake and really should not complain at all at what it got. Again: this is purely from an geographic, strategic and economic perspective AND not from the suffering etc. people had to endure, that really is a whole other discussion which quickly evolves around words like ""hate"", ""deserving"" or ""not deserving"", ""revenge"" and things like that.

This isnt true only 85 years ago Austrians voted to be apart of germany.

&gt; That doesn't take away any Celtic identity or history or whatever.

Yes it does a country cannot be Germanic and celtic at the same time. By claiming is Germanic your essentially claiming were just english. As since according to you language is the only thing that matters irish people dont exsist by that logic.

&gt;It's merely an observation about language. Don't get yourself offended or angry over it.

No it's not it's a damn near racist way to claim that only Germanic nations can be successful by claiming the likes of ireland are germanic and discredit southern europe.

There       is some ethical guidance that you should not discriminate the       administration of life saving treatment based on age, in fact even some       legal protection against this. It is however understandable to  some      degree in the Covid crisis (however, it should not be a points  based      system like this). However, what is obvious is that is  morally      outrageous to discriminate solely on sex the administration  of life      saving treatment.

And it is you who are claiming that it somehow got worse, despite it clearly not being the case. In the 80s we had heavy metal rains, you can see the smog on pretty much all the photos, and it regualrly was hard to breath. Now once in a while we have some smog at worst.

I know enough to know that communism is a flawed, outdated ideology that belongs on the garbage bin of history. Nobody is seriously considering whether we should or should nor implement one of 20 branches of esoteric fascism, and communism (all permutations of it) belongs in the same category of ""proven to be worthless so many times over, there's no need to deliberate further on it because everyone knows it's garbage"".

3409,"&gt; Amsterdam 

We're not speaking specifically about Amsterdam, but fine. AirBnb should comply with Amsterdam's laws. 

&gt; AirBnB just adds another layer on top of that to increase it even more.

AirBnB wouldn't be able to charge the prices they do if there wasn't a shortage to begin with. Ergo a symptom, not the cause. 

&gt; AirBnB competes with hotels, which there are enough of already in the cities were AirBnB is so problematic.

Evidently not, otherwise there wouldn't be a market for AirBnB in the first place. 

&gt; But because AirBnB hosts can circumvent a ton of regulations and others costs hotels have, they can undercut those hotels in price.

There are still regulations that AirBnB have to follow, they just pertain more to the specific regulations of property usage and ownership that already exist. AirBnBs still have roughly the same operating costs that a hotel would have if they want to remain competitive. Sheets still need to be cleaned, appliances repaired, etc. 

What allows AirBnB to undercut hotels is mostly on the consumer side of the equation. The advantage of a hotel are the services they offer such as transporting your baggage, room service, maid service, and on-site restaurants, bars, conference rooms, swimming pools, etc. However, recently consumers haven't cared as much about that stuff to justify paying the extra price on top of having a smaller room in a worse location. 

This is why hostels and budget hotels have not been hurt as much by the rise of AirBnB, because they compete more directly with them.",Einsiedelmann,/r/europe/comments/g45y1w/airbnb_landlords_feel_the_pain_as_the_coronavirus/fnw1uvr/,Fredfredbug4,1587309721

Anti-Semitism in Poland, if it occurs, is in the marginal and least educated group of society.
In Israel, racist, anti-Polish shameful claims are made by representatives of society. Members of the government or other politicians.

Example: Minister of Foreign Affairs Izrael Katz said that Poles sucked anti-Semitism in mother's milk.

For example, according to this study, if it weren't for Euro then Greece would have recovered in 3-4 years with only minor damages which is utterly ridiculous to anyone with even the slightest idea of the situation. They basically say that Greek debt isn't an issue for their calculations because their comparison countries didn't have the same debt issues.

Or how about France, because they linked France to Australia with weight of 55% it means that France is constantly underperforming because Australia had ridiculous GDP/capita growth in the early 21st century. And I mean overtaking the US by a wide margin for a while level of stupid growth.

There are also problems in the study when they link two countries together with absurd weighings like how Spain and Italy are weighed 60-70% by the UK which pretty much means that any deviation in the UK affects the two countries numbers which are then counted as being the fault of the Euro.

He kept a meticulous diary for most of his life. An American professor found it and recreated his life as based on it. 

It’s an insanely interesting read, not gruesome or graphically violent. It has shown me an image of medieval life I never had and that is way more interesting than royal lives. It’s also rag to riches story since executioners were guild members (guild = good, reputable) but their trade was the opposite to that and placed them only slightly above gypsies and courtesans and prostitutes. 

Franz decided to make a name for himself. Never drank, never whored, crystal clear dude that earned many privileges unbefitting his trade.

All developed countries are protectionist towards their agriculture in some way. It's a labor intensive industry that would be outsourced to 3rd world countries decades without protectionism.

BUT, this has no connection with our now world famous "" swedish strategy"". The strategy aims at flattening the curve and make sure the hospitals do not get too crowded by reducing human contact and avoiding situations were those can occur. Having a elderly care system with an underpaid and under-educated workforce that compromises of mostly immigrants with no other choice but to go to work no matter their physical state. That is a big shame!

Regarding the strategy we are not very unlike other countries. We have made major efforts to reduce the spread of the virus but still making sure the country still runs, partly so that the hospital still works. The only thing  we have not done is close down our lower grade schools. The reason for that is that studies show, aswell as common knowledge, that childrens mental and physical state deteriates when not able to socialize. Considering children are not the main concern and not prone to spreading it's not beneficial for what we call ""folkhälsan"", the overall health of the population, to close schools. Why kill people in other ways just to save them from one thing?

I lived in Germany for four years from 2014 on and felt kind of like this. I speak German passably, had a faculty position at the local uni, had a kid in Germany, etc. but I felt trapped by a lot of the immigration rules. IMHO it would have been a lot easier to get a settlement permit if I had just showed up on the border with nothing. 

First, I want to say that I'm a lefty and am pro-refugee; I absolutely respect the fact that many asylum seekers flee deadly conflicts. One of the guys in a German class I took at the FHS had lost his parents and brother in Afghanistan, and was granted asylum in Germany in 2015 at 17. I feel nothing but compassion for this guy and wish him nothing but the best.

However, in those same FHS classes it was also super clear that many of the new arrivals had gamed the system and were just looking for better jobs. You can't spend time interacting with these people and not notice that. So it really rubbed me the wrong way that I had to pay thousands of euros for work permit and business permit renewals, had to reach B1 German, and these guys didn't have to do any of that. I'm impressed that they kept coming to class at all, since they didn't have to like many of us did (it was in my uni contract that I had to teach classes in German after a certain point). 

I don't know what Germany can do to fix this issue, but passing restrictive immigration laws will just cause frustration and expense for law-abiding legal immigrants.

3891,"Those of us who are sceptical about the worth of citizens’ assemblies have been noting with interest the upshot of the French citizens’ convention for the climate which delivered its recommendations this week. The thing about these assemblies of randomly selected citizens mulling over thorny issues is that they’re a brilliant way for elected politicians to shift the responsibility for really unpopular policies onto someone else. Except they can go horribly wrong.

President Macron used this device to deal with the threat from the gilets jaune, back in those distant days when citizens could actually assemble in France. He had to deal with a movement that was driven by the concerns of predominantly rural voters who felt ignored by the elite while placating the urban young exercised about climate change. What better than to go through the motions of direct democracy to appease the first group while giving the random citizens a brief that would ensure that their conclusions appeased the environmentalists? The convention was asked how to ensure that French carbon emissions would be reduced by 40 per cent in 2030 from 1990 levels.

The upshot was precisely as you’d expect: the convention has come up with proposals that no sane politician would actually want to take to the electorate, especially not in rural France. They recommend closing hypermarkets, shelving the 5G network because it uses more electricity, prohibiting the sale of cars whose emissions exceed that of most current models, and banning hoardings that might encourage people to drive further to buy things. Advertisements, whether print broadcast or online, for items generating excessive CO2 would be banned; those that were authorised would be forced to carry the words: ‘Do you really need this?’. Some of the proposals are decent, such as encouraging the use of local shops over chain stores, but the overall effect is bossy, authoritarian and appallingly expensive for poorer people.

The president now has to decide how to deal with this embarrassment. You see, he made the mistake at the outset of declaring that the convention’s proposals would be taken seriously; they would be implemented immediately, put before parliament for legislation, or submitted to a referendum. That was then, when no one anticipated a situation where the French economy would be shrinking by six per cent in a year.

The problem with citizens’ assemblies is that its members don’t, unlike elected politicians, actually have to deal with the consequences of their breezy and idealistic proposals. In the first place, they are rarely representative of the entire population: in France, 25,000 people were approached to see if they wanted to take part; most refused, and 150 were chosen. Most of those are people with an agenda, who are prepared to give up entire weekends in return for a stipend of £74 (€86) a day plus expenses. In other words, political activists and people with time on their hands.

It was the same with the Irish citizens’ assembly on abortion. As in that case, the conclusions people come to depend on the agenda they are presented with. If the experts who brief them have a particular bias, pro-choice or hardcore green, then the recommendations will reflect that. The Irish body wasn’t presented with pro-foetus experts except as a minority view (you can see the programme online); I’d wager that the French convention was similarly skewed towards environmentalists rather than economists.

The thing about normal democracy is that it’s a way for us to choose people to make difficult decisions about policy and then implement them in law. In exceptional cases, the true direct democracy of a referendum can be used. Delegating these choices to a collection of unelected individuals is passing the buck. Mr Macron now has to find a way to evade the consequences of his idiot exercise. The old rule applies: never ask people their opinion unless you know the answer you want them to come up with, and then fix the process to make sure that’s what happens.",,/r/europe/comments/g43ymu/frances_citizens_climate_convention_has_come_back/fnv81ik/,casualphilosopher1,1587283463

4007,"But people do know. We have a lot of data now, even if it is imperfect. The epidemiologists with their much more detailed modelling have also inferred underlying hospitalisation, mortality etc rates trying to estimate the undiagnosed part of the population. Where they can overlaying the varying levels and types of testing, infection, hospitalisationa and mortality across different geographies and and demographic profits to start to get more of a picture. So for example a lot of the reports I've read are converging on 0.5% or lower as a truer estimate of underlying mortality. And similarly 2% or so hospitalisation rate on true underlying basis and under 0.5% for people under 40yo, with almost negligible hospitalisation rates for people under 20yo.  Mortality rates are also negligible on an underlying basis for anyone under 20 and similarly for people between 20-40. For example, the mortality rate with partial but not complete normalisation for undiagnosed mild cases is 3 in 1000 for people in their 20s. You can imagine how low it is once you properly normalise it.   


Your calculation is nonsensical as well. It takes no account of nuance. So for example, if you were to focus on re-socialising those under 40, not only would hospitalisation rates be lower but the requirement for ICU is c1/3 to 1/4 of that and in turn the requirement for invasive/intubated ventilation is much less pronounced. Meaning that even that a very large portion of those under 40 cases now going to ICU could be treated in a normal bed with oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation (machines for which are being manufactured at a rate of 7-10k per WEEK currently, depending on estimate and whether or not you include ventilators being manufactured outside of the traditional respiratory trade body which includes ResMed and the like).  


Moreover, if there is any truth to what we are starting to here on Remesvedir, it is dramatically reducing the duration of fever in severe cases and also dramatically reducing time on ventilation (often as little as one day even in severe and elderly cases) and time to discharge. 

In addition you don't in any way account for the fact that herd immunity is progressive, not binary. And can be achieved selectively rather than through broad enforcement or release of social lockdowns. So if for example you resocialise a large part of the less vulnerable part of society whilst maintaining strict quarantine controls on the elderly, otherwise vulnerable and anyone who lives/helps them, you can achieve meaningful levels of community immunity before you even get to the older demographics. Which significantly slows the spread even before you get to the so called 60% herd immunity threshold everyone talks about. In a 'typical OECD' country more than half of the population is under the age of 40 and more than 1/3rd under the age of 30.

&amp;#x200B;

Putting it altogether and using Australia as an example (home of ResMed). They had something like 2k ICU beds which has gone to about 7k now. This number is constantly increasing, as is the number of non-ICU non-invasively ventilated beds. They have 25m people, so say 13m people under 40. 0.5% underlying hospitalisation rate for these 13m or 65k. Average hospitalisation requirement of 10 days (more like 7 days in reality and even lower with Remesdevir). So if you cycled through 10 cycles or a bit over three months, you would need 6.5k hospital beds available to accommodate and this would get you through more than half of the population in three months. Aus has added 5k ICU beds alone (ie 5k ICUs that didn't exist before so are fully available for covid cases). This ignores ventilated non-ICU beds.

&amp;#x200B;

The above is overly simplistic but it shows how there is more capacity for resocialisation than the fearmongers are letting on.  

&amp;#x200B;

I think if anything, the strong level of social compliance observed to date globally in response to lockdown measures is proof that governments can now proceed to utilise much more nuanced lockdown and release policies with a realistic expectation of social compliance .  


Basically the choice is, leave in irrational fear and keep your economies indefinitely locked down until the 'if and when' of a vaccine (At least 12 months). You will ruin yourself financially. Or recognise that now is the time to start resocialising the population in order to achieve some level of herd immunity.",,/r/europe/comments/g2xc6z/sweden_is_beginning_to_see_some_effects_of_herd/fnup5b3/,HedgeFundDropout,1587267517

It is much less than speculative that individuals whom contract this virus will in fact have an increased immunity.  It is most definite that you can become reinfected, but the second time, and every subsequent time after, the effects of the virus will be much less pronounced on reinfected persons.
[Many different viruses cause what is colloquially termed as the common cold and among those viruses are several strains of coronavirus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/general-information.html).

The US does actually offer public healthcare to low income ([Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov)) and elderly ([Medicare ](https://www.medicare.gov)) as well as a relatively robust [social security system](https://www.ssa.gov) , [unemployment benefits ](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/unemployment-insurance) , and other assistance programs like [food stamps ](https://www.usa.gov/food-help)  and [public housing ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidized_housing_in_the_United_States) .

As an American who has spent many years living in various European countries and is married to a European ... It’s always so amusing for me to listen to what Europeans think America is like and what Americans think Europe is like, especially on Reddit.

4102,"I'm talking actual facts. Kohima was a minor battle in a minor theatre. Key point being that very few troops were involved and it took place in the Indian theater. Unless you think Japan was heartbroken by losing 10,000 troops in a single battle. The US, meanwhile, actually invaded the Japanese home islands and had several gigantic naval battles with the imperial japanese navy. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think the goalposts even are? The US did way more than the UK in WW2 because the US actually fought in World War II with millions more men and exponetially more military industrial production which the US was exporting to all the other allied powers, including the Soviet Union. 

&amp;#x200B;

The UK did nothing for the first few years of the war. It sat on its hand when Poland was invaded in 1939 through the first 8 months of sitzkrieg, then it evacuated France. That's not a blemish on the UK, but it's not like the British were actually doing much fighting anyway during the first few years of the war before the US got involved. 

&amp;#x200B;

In continental Europe the US did the vast majority of the fighting while the British army were conserving troops numbers for political reasons. Namely, they didn't have troops to spare and it was easier to let the US do most of the fighting since the US had millions more men to fight and the UK wouldn't have any army left at the end of the war if they fully went all out fighting the Germans.",,/r/europe/comments/fvxdil/on_this_day_1917_usa_officialy_declared_war_on/fnue2t0/,CheWeNeedYou,1587260024

There are a lot of countries doing what you're experiencing there in Romania (maybe not exactly like it, but similar.) Heavy use of police to check where people are going and why. Heavy restrictions on where one can go and why. Paperwork requirements for doing so. If you're going out for groceries, you have to use the closest store. Exercise may not be allowed, if it is, it has to be in an area immediate to your home. Some places have night time curfews (which make no sense--the virus doesn't magically transmit more in night than day. If anything it's counterproductive since its concentrating people during day time hours.)

And then there are places where police aren't playing much of a role at all except if they see really severe violations (like groups of people with no social distancing) or are called for violations.

Here in Berlin I take a daily walk of about 5km. I can go wherever I want whenever I want. People are in parks enjoying the weather (but trying to keep space between each other--social distancing is being observed.) Police aren't getting involved unless they have to. 

Undoubtedly there will be studying of the restrictions and I suspect a lot of them will be found to be excessive. There is no need for aggressive use of police.",,/r/europe/comments/g3ru24/both_cars_crashed_into_each_other_today_in_new/fnuie87/,stripyirishwolfhound,1587262818

Dear Sub-Human Filth,

I'm appealing to all of you stupid idiots to vote Labour in 2019. That is if you have the basic education enough to read a ballot, anyway. I understand the majority of you racist little englanders can't even read this post, though. But those who can, please pass my message on to the rest of your inbred family.

We Corybanites are morally, culturally and intellectually superior to you in every way. I will qualify myself by noting that I have a Liberal Arts degree from Eton, which you obviously have never been to, if you even know what one is. I also have a black friend. I have been told by several professors that everything you hold dear is terrible. Therefore you, personally, are also terrible.

I don't know you, but I know that you're racist. I also know that you hate gay people and still get scared during lightning storms.

The religion which you hold closely, greatly believe in, and which brings you comfort--you are wrong because I'm smarter than you and I'm telling you so. It is one of the many reasons why you are stupid and I'm better than you.

You see, Labour wants a system which helps everyone in the world. Our system is designed around love and kindness to everyone. If you don't agree, I hate you.

It's not too late to change. If you knew your history, which of course you don't, you'll remember a time in the UK when Aboriginals were dragged away from their homes and forced to assimilate into white society. Well, we want to change that kind of behaviour (sorry for my spelling, as I'm not from your country) by making sure you go to college and have a small apartment in a big city of London, where you belong. That will help you rid yourselves of your backward, incorrect culture and way of thinking. We'll do everything we can to make sure you agree with us and say all the right things and not be brainwashed against thinking the same way we do.

All of you stupid, backward, country, racist, homophobic, uneducated yokels need to realize we're trying to build a classless society where we all get to live in harmony with each other, where we're all equal. If you only understood that you wouldn't be so much worse of a person than I am.

So please vote Labour. Help me help you, you worthless motherfuckers.",Chile,/r/europe/comments/g3mkpo/public_opinion_of_labour_and_the_conservatives/fnu07pb/,CMuenzen,1587251981

It was a minor battle in a minor theatre of the Asian war. That was why so few men were involved in it. It had nothing to do with defeating Japan. Japan never made a big commitment to seize India to begin with.

The major land battles in the Asian war happened in New Guinea, Iwo Jima, and especially Okinawa. These were actual major battles of large strategic importance which led to the surrender of Japan. By the time 100,000 Japanese troops were killed at Okinawa there were now allied heavy bombers using its airfields to bomb the shit out of the Japanese home islands, of which Okinawa was one. 

Then there was the entire naval conflict, of which nearly 100% of the fighting was done by the US against the imperial Japanese navy. How many aircraft carriers did Britain have in 1945 again?

To get more clean casettes he borrow a bike from family friend cause bikes was in short supply too, and rode to Szczecin (more or less 30-40 kilometers away from his village) to buy them from students in local engineering school in exchange for vodka and sending a telegram back home about he is fine and he go back soon cause as normal in communist Poland for village where live like 800 people it was astounding numbers of telephones, all 5 of them. One installed in state owned farm bureau, second in home of state owned farm director, one in local priest and two of them in houses ORMO (volunteer police formation, the main tasks are harassment of the local community, alcoholism, beating oppositionists and cooperation with the secret police. Hated by anyone, including regular police) members to inform secret police about antigovt activities around.  


At house he had like 30 other teens from village which want to saw computer on their own eyes. Knowlegde how computers works help him a couple times in late People Republic as computers knowlegde was in short supply as consprict got very cozy position in telecommunication unit close to home (usually conspricts was sent to military units at other side of country, if you life in mountains in south of country you had a lot of chance to end in navy and military units in northern parts of country for example, a common explanation around was fact not being local so in case of sending army to stop antigovernment protests as consprict had less chance side with protesters what the hell happening or just escape and hide with family help) and after fall of communism he got work in one of first private telecom company in country building one of the first fiber optic lines in the country earning three times more than grandma in state owned farm.

4311,"&gt;I can judge the Poles just as well as I can judge the Germans for the exact same behavior.

Or you know, you can be mature, be objective and stop blaming either nationality for something that their forebearers did. Germans nowadays are not responsible for the Holocaust or Nazi war crimes, in the same way that current day Poles are not responsible for any crimes that Poland had ever comitted (and I'm not even sure what you meant by your statement tbh).

I'm not targeting Germans in this comment section, this isn't some holy crusade against Germans from a hypocritical ""Polak"". This is the reality of it: the comment section is full of Nazi apologists. I'm tired of seeing comments where people spin Nazi war crimes into Allied war crimes, as if they're even fucking comparable. 

The expulsion of Germans from the 40s to the 60s was the lesser of two evils. It was perpetrated by the Soviet Union, not by the Poles (though we did have a small, insignificant part in it) so I don't even understand this belief that we did this on purpose. From what I've seen, the Polish government in-exile (aka the only legitimate one) didn't want the German territory that was given to us. Anyway that was a little off-topic. The alternative to the expulsions would be a genocide, which would have been atrocious and certainly up there with the Holocaust. So in this case, I genuinely believe that the Germans in these territories got off lucky, considering how blood-thirsty both the Soviets and the Polish (Communist) governments were.

&gt;Potsdam agreement: ""The Three Governments (ergo not Poland), having considered the question in all its aspects, recognize that the transfer to Germany of German populations, or elements thereof, remaining in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, will have to be undertaken. They agreed that any transfers that take place should be effected in an orderly and humane manner.""

[Source: Expulsion of Germans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_(1944–1950))

&gt;I do remember Poland starting multiple wars and invading most of its neighbors tho.

Not one to be a whataboutist, but you are Lithuanian, and unless I'm mistaken: Lithuania invaded and annexed most of its neighbours too. I am not judging your country because of a grudge, on the other hand you seem to have a grudge, and thus you're not being objective. Every country did this at one point. Poland was no exception and neither was Germany. The difference here is that Poland didn't commit mass genocide.

[Source: Lithuania at its height (pot calling the kettle black?) ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania)

Poland invaded the Soviet Union following the Polish-Soviet war (of the 1920s) and successfully annexed parts of Ukraine and Belarus (Peace of Riga). Later on, Poland also annexed Vilnius region from Lithuania. These were deplorable acts and for what its worth I'm truly sorry that this had to have happened. On the flip side, I'm not going to address the annexation of Zaolzie because that's a whole different can of worms that's best left unopened, but as far as we are concerned, that was TECHNICALLY NOT an invasion, the population held a LEGAL plebiscite and voted to join Poland, furthermore it was majority ethnically and historically Polish.

[Source: Polish-Soviet War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish–Soviet_War)

&gt;""The National Democrats did not want non-Polish minorities in the reborn Polish state to constitute more than one third of the overall population, and were therefore prepared to accept a Polish-Soviet border which was substantially to the west of what was being offered by the Soviet side, even though this would leave hundreds of thousands of people who were ethnically Polish on the Soviet side of the border."" - Doesn't seem to me like Poland walked into the conference with the aim of annexing these regions.

[Source: Żeligowski's Mutiny (annexation of Vilnius) ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Żeligowski%27s_Mutiny) - Poland did bad stuff too, here is a false flag operation carried out by us.

Unless I'm missing something, I think I addressed the majority of ""invasions"" that Poland perpetrated in the last 100 years. Also, we have never (atleast not in the last 100 years?) invaded Germany or Slovakia. 

Germany, on the a similar note, had annexed Austria completely (not just partially) in 1938, a few months later they also annexed the Sudetenland due to the Munich Agreement. A few months down the line they annexed the entirety of Czechia and set up Slovakia as a protectorate. Now so far both countries are fairly comparable (if you ignore Imperial German crimes and genocides, which are again a different can of worms). However Germany goes and triggers a false flag attack in Gliewitz and invades and occupies Poland, another sovereign nation, and begins building DEATH and CONCENTRATION camps.

[Source: Annexation of Austria ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss) - This was done pretty willingly, so if you're gonna compare it to anything, let that be to Zaolzie.

[Source: Annexation of the Sudetenland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement) - Simple form of appeasement carried out by Chamberlain. Didn't appease Hitler for too long though.

[Source: First Vienna Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Vienna_Award) - Oh what a surprise, Hungary also annexed a bit of Slovakia. Goes to show how common this was. 

Please remind when Poland built such camps, specifically for the purpose of extermination. I am curious, since you are so quick to compare the two. Also I don't recall Poland having a political armed force - the SS - which went around exterminating target groups. 

[Source: Nazi Concentration Camps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps) - No Polish act could make this acceptable in any way, shape or form.

4312,"It's like in the Netherlands. Every time there's an influx of migrants, the left wing wants an amnesty, and the right wing protests. Eventually, the right wing accedes on the condition that they get to pass stricter immigration laws so it doesn't happen again, and the migrants are all pardoned and legalized. 

Such laws are then passed, but the next influx, the laws are just ignored, just like the previous time.  But in return for the amnesty, the right wing wants to pass even stricter laws, which is then done, but the influx after that they'll all just be legalized *again*, and the laws -on paper- made even stricter *again*, and so on.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/g3s92m/germany_plans_stricter_citizenship_rules/fntnhv5/,marinuso,1587245205

4314,"In principle I completely agree but in practice it's not that simple.

&gt; They should pay more to mobilize their own fellow countrymen

Paying more would increase the price, which would sink some UK agricultural businesses and make the rest less competitive.

&gt; Country should mobilize it residents or move production to other parts of Europe.

Mobilizing residents is sensible but it requires residents who are able and willing. Able to do physically demanding agricultural jobs and able to physically reach the place (commuting from London to East Anglia to pick fruits from early morning may not be very attractive to Britons). By willing I mean that people should not think that doing ""immigrant jobs"" is beneath them.

Regarding importing from Europe, if they actually reinstall border control, there is a very real physical bottleneck in the form of the Channel that would prevent transporting fresh produce. This would be a problem regardless of our discussion topic because the UK only produces around ~60% of the food it consumes anyway.

Even if we only consider products that can be preserved (frozen/pickled/salted, whatever), UK farms would still have to compete with European and/or US farms. EU farms are subsidized by the EU and have high standards (UK farms could cut costs by lowering quality). US farms are also subsidized and are quite efficient (partly because of lower standards).

Maybe it's not impossible to make the UK agriculture competitive without underpaid Eastern European immigrants but I don't see a simple way of doing it and definitely don't see the political will.",COVID-era misanthrope,/r/europe/comments/g3srif/backlash_as_farm_brings_in_eastern_european_fruit/fntniiu/,AllinWaker,1587245215

Then January it was still pretty softcore, and end of January is when China did the lockdown. So if you said beginning of February I could've agreed with you. I do think though that misinformation from China shaped a wrong image of the virus, but to what degree European negligence can be attributed to that is something I can't tell yet. At some point it becomes too much to properly limit the spread, especially with test shortages. But South Korea was successful, so why not the EU? I think because Korea had cases earlier than the EU did, so they acted faster on securing tests. EU didn't bat en eye, then it was in their countries and tests were gone.

4395,"Everything is not as normal, most Swedes are keeping to themselves as much as possible. Some sporting events are held yes, thoug those that would draw crowds are held without onlookers. Any gathering of more than 50 persons a banned. 

There is a difference between forcing people to stay at home and letting responsible people keep the distance from one another to keep the spread of a global pandemic from overwhelming the hospitals. 

To be frank, what is the end plan for all the countries that are locking down?

As soon as the lockdown is ended, the spread will resume in the remaining populace. More or less every social being will be in contact with this virus. And a vaccine is probably a year away if it is to be tested. Are they going to keep their countries in lockdown for a year hoping that there is a vaccine at that time?

TLDR No, that is incorrect.

&gt;**Smokers removed from risk list - believes age is the most important factor**

&gt;The Institute of Public Health has removed smokers from the list of people at risk of serious illness at Covid-19. ""Age seems to be the most obvious risk factor,"" says Senior Consultant Sara Watle at the Institute of Public Health.

&gt;The Public Health Institute (FHI) maintains its own list of persons at risk of severe progression of Covid-19. The list lists risk factors that can lead to more serious illnesses including pneumonia and difficulty breathing, and provides advice to people in the risk groups and their relatives.

&gt;From April 1, it has been stated that smoking is a risk factor. This point was removed from the list on Tuesday.

&gt;- We have removed smoking from the list because this in itself does not stand out as a risk factor for serious progress of Covid-19 in available data from the outbreak. It is also not clear that, for example, COPD stands out for the time being, writes senior consultant Sara Watle at the Institute of Public Health by e-mail to Dagens Medisin.

&gt;- We must make reservations that this may change as we gain more knowledge. We do not have specific recommendations for smokers in connection with Covid-19, but we still consider smoking to be harmful to health.

&gt;Points to age
The FHI list now shows that three groups are at increased risk of serious illness: Elderly people over the age of 65, people with cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure, and people with diabetes. This is based on today's knowledge, states the superior.

&gt;- The knowledge base for which basic diseases cause an increased risk of serious Covid-19 disease is still limited, but age appears to be the most obvious risk factor. Several countries also report an incidence of cardiovascular disease, as well as diabetes, in patients in need of intensive care. says Watle, who works at the Department of Infection Protection and Vaccine.

&gt;- Difficult to say
FHI also lists groups that may be at increased risk of serious course, such as people with morbid obesity, severe lung function and people undergoing immunosuppressive treatment such as chemotherapy.

&gt;The groups are listed partly on the basis of knowledge from Norway and partly on the basis of knowledge about basic disorders that increase the risk of other types of respiratory infections, Watle says.

&gt;- For other basic illnesses that cause impaired lung function or weakened immune systems, it is difficult to say whether it is age, basic illness or a combination of both that presents a higher risk of serious illness.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/g3ti0k/norwegian_public_health_institute_removes_smoking/fntbr8x/,Crayon-Girl,1587238491

No, it's not in a style we invented, but it's 100% ours as far as the design goes. Would Kraków still be Kraków if it's old town and Wawel hill were demolished and skyscrapers were built in their place? What then would make Kraków stand out? 

What is unique about a blue box compared to another? And then, what is unique about a gothic building compared to another? I can point out thousands of differences between Sukiennice and Salisbury cathedral, Milan cathedral, Westminster abbey, Cologne cathedral, Palazzo Publico in Siena. They're all built in the same style, but have extreme differences in how they were built to look.

You are not seeing disproportionate amount of deaths, you think it is disproportionate. Your anecdotal evidence does not matter to what the policy should be. The statistics show that the general public does take it seriously and have changed their ways.

What you don't get is that for a discussion to take place you need actual data. Just saying you don't think it's good and reference some anecdotal stuff you saw outside isn't a valid argument.

Different societies need different approaches, which we clearly can see in the numbers now since there has not been an explosion in Sweden unlike other countries.

Flase. It was shaped by the epidemeologists at FHM, not bureaucrats.

&gt;In practice, the core task of managing the outbreak fell to a single man: state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell at the National Institute of Public Health.

This signle sentance discredits the entire article, Tegnell decides nothing by himself. And is also contraditory to the previous sentance.

&gt;It should be noted, though, that the state epidemiologist’s policy choice has been strongly criticized by independent experts in Sweden. Some 22 of the country’s most prominent professors in infectious diseases and epidemiology published a commentary in Dagens Nyheter calling on Tegnell to resign and appealing to the government to take a different course of action.

Two of those 22 are epidemeologists, the rest of them are irrelevant. It should also be mentioned that they based their arguments on a few data points that were immeadiatly proven to be false, hence they are also liars. Following these revelations they just accepted that the data they presented was false, yet they still maintained that their conclusion was right and that it didn't matter if the didn't have any data.

Opening the beach to everyone, at least in Spain, means thousands of people moving from the cities to the coast, from their usual residence to their second house, where they may meet with old people etc. 

The coast here can get extremely crowded, so I’m guessing we don’t have the means necessary to guarantee the social distancing...that would mean lots of police, everywhere, for one.

Anyway, we’ll see. We’re near the end of the more strict measures, I honestly hope you’re right.",,/r/europe/comments/g3mfn2/a_man_violating_quarantine_at_the_beach_in_rimini/fnsxmqa/,denenai,1587230741

Deleted provisions
One stroke of the pen changed more than you might think. Yesterday, President Andrzej Duda signed a bill technically called Shield 2.0. This is a special act about help for entrepreneurs and employees in times of crisis caused by the outbreak of coronavirus. The new law is coming into force.

One article catches the eye in the maze of laws. And not only because during the legislative work it was given the number ""100"". This provision deprives the National Electoral Commission of the key powers that it had until yesterday in connection with the organization of presidential elections.

The NEC will no longer be able to, for example, specify the design of ballot papers, and order printing of these cards and announcements. It will no longer be possible to download certificates of voting rights or apply for voting by proxy.

In turn, municipalities may not provide voters with information on numbers and boundaries of permanent and separate voting circuits, seats of precinct electoral commissions and premises adapted to the needs of disabled voters.

An article of the Electoral Code was also suspended saying that the electoral commissioner ""at the latest on the 21st day prior to election day, provides voters in permanent voting circuits, in the form of non-addressed printed form placed in mailboxes, information on election dates, voting hours, voting conditions and conditions the validity of the vote in a given election. ""

Also introduced into space were regulations introduced just three weeks ago, which allowed voters in quarantine and those over 60 years of age to vote by post (so far only the disabled had this option).

In practice, this means that Law and Justice has put everything on one card. Either elections in full correspondence organized by Jacek Sasin with the help of Poczta Polska will take place or there will be none at all. It's just that the provisions that give you the opportunity to implement this first option are still not there.",,/r/europe/comments/g3rb4r/poland_there_is_no_one_to_organize_presidential/fnsxzgk/,Logiman43,1587230933

4599,"&gt;And the other one isnt? It was officially called Danzig, the Free City it Danzig. For almost a century though, it’s been called Gdansk now.

No because that is just a translation based on the official language of that time. See also Lüttich / Liège / Liége,  Aachen/Aix-La-Chapelle/Aken, Mülhausen/Mulhouse and so on. When the official language is a Germanic or Swedish one, the City was called Danzig. When it's Polish or Slavic, its Gdańsk or Gduńsk. There's no official renaming happening here, like with Chemnitz and Karl-Marx-Stadt.



&gt;Call it whatever you want in your language, but in English and most languages of the world it’s Gdansk

Will you go and correct people every time they say Peking in an international forum then, eventhough their own university uses that name? (Because the correct english adaptation of the pinyin is Beijing). What about Tokyo Metropolis because the city isn't actually just called Tokyo? Why are you not putting the accent on Gdańsk, since thats the actual official english name? 

Point is, the purpose of the naming is to get the point across to many people. Because European WW2 started over it, everybody who has ever had history lessons knows the name Danzig. The more correct name for a certain city is, even in english, Kyiv, but nobody will know what you're talking about until you use the ""outdated"" name of Kiev.",,/r/europe/comments/g3g9k9/my_city_gdańsk_gduńsk_danzig_over_a_thousand/fnskmr1/,LightningEnex,1587223569

Exactly. That's why preservation of them is so important. A person sooner or later dies, so far there is nothing that we can do about it. A person will live as long as life lets them and the only thing immortal that they can leave are their ideas and thoughts.

Those thoughts can be immortal as long as we preserve them. Thus, the burning of those libraries was worse because it killed the immortal ideas of people who were already dead and couldn't be reproduced. The only part of them that could have been immortal on this Earth has vanquished and they are no more.

4640,"&gt;I think what ppl went through justifies it

What people went through doesn't make it just either. Or good. Whether it is ""acceptable"" is going to be more subjective but if you interpret that as ""the right thing to do morally"" I think it isn't a good mentality to have either. There was no justice in the expulsion much like there was non in the partitions either.

Also, a significant amount of the territories we are talking about here weren't naturally part of the nation of Poland before WW2. The areas were given in return for the Soviets taking Eastern Poland and you can't really blame the Germans living in those territories for not being loyal to Poland.

The areas hadn't been Polish in over two hundred years at minimum so it is turning matters around to argue they didn't deserve to live in the country. They were already living in one, just one that lost territory in a war. Considering Polish history I doubt you'd believe losing territory justifies ethnic cleansing (this doesn't have to be killing) of those living there.

To summarize, Polish actions were indeed understandable as a consequence of what happened before. But that doesn't make the actions themselves a good/just thing.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/g3g9k9/my_city_gdańsk_gduńsk_danzig_over_a_thousand/fnslca7/,Sondar12,1587223976

As a result, last year Italy was the first G-7 country to join the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s global infrastructure project.

Such easy lies to whisper in the ears of the Western reader, who's being taught by the entirety of his media that China is the new enemy. And only collaborators would make deals with the enemy, wouldn't they?

Except [negotiations about the BRI were started under the Gentiloni government, which did not include and was vehemently opposed by the Five Stars](https://jamestown.org/program/italy-joins-the-belt-and-road-initiative-context-interests-and-drivers/). In fact, between the Gentiloni government who opened talks and the Conte government who signed the final deal, a supermajority of the Italian political spectrum approved of the BRI.

But you're not told any of this by this piece of Western imperial propaganda. In this piece of propaganda, Italy's accession to the BRI is exclusively a result of the Five Stars' fifth-columism, and nothing else.

&gt; “For a decade, the Five Star Movement has been spreading the idea that the trans-Atlantic alliance is some sort of submission to the American empire, fueling suspicion of NATO, leading their voters into believing in alternative truths, and all the while promoting the notion that there are well-functioning systems outside the Western liberal democratic framework,” Talia said.

This is raving lunacy.

Multinational.

Dutch, German, Polish, and probably many other languages.

But when you remember these were the same people who were happy to embrace Nazism and eradicate/enslave Poles and all the slavs of the USSR. Then it becomes less sad that they were simply told to leave.

Or when you remember that this was a common occurrence all over German occupied Poland:

&gt;In Warsaw, Dirlewanger participated in the Wola massacre, together with police units rounding up and shooting some 40,000 civilians, most of them in just two days.[1] In the same Wola district, Dirlewanger burned three hospitals with patients inside, while the nurses were ""whipped, gang-raped and finally hanged naked, together with the doctors"" to the accompaniment of the popular song ""In München steht ein Hofbräuhaus"".[1] Later, ""they drank, raped and murdered their way through the Old Town, slaughtering civilians and fighters alike without distinction of age or sex.""[2] In the Old Town – where about 30,000 civilians were killed – several thousand wounded in field hospitals overrun by the Germans were shot and set on fire with flamethrowers.

In fact often real estate promoters can do tons of stuff to make areas appealing for people working there, like planning for stores, food courts, leisure areas, even art. A pleasant appealing business area is more high end, more prestige, easier to attract workers wanting to work there, it can pull more money.

Two years ago, when the French government tried to progressively increase taxes on diesel from 53 to 78 cents per liter, it started the massive protest movement of the yellow jackets. Many of them complained at the same time about the lack of public spending and asked for wage subsidies. The same people didn't care about increased income taxes a few years before, as only the richest half of the population pays it, and complained about the limitation of the wealth tax to real estate.

It seems to me that there is widespread support for increased taxes and higher spending, as long as most of said taxes are paid by others. That's especially true in Southern Europe (including my own country), as opposed to Scandinavia for example. When people clearly have to pay for it themselves, it's often more contentious.

Lets get a few facts straight:

1. It was already known that Kornikov was a Russian contact in 2017. This was made public in an article by the New York Times. ([link](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/world/europe/russia-ukraine-fake-news-dutch-vote.html)).
2. It  was already known that he had contact with Baudet (even before he was  in government). There is a literal picture of baudet in the article from  2017.
3. He  also had contact with atleast 1 other Dutch politician, Harry van  Bommel of the Socialist Party, (sorry to disappoint the right wing hate  boner)
4. Not only did Vladimir Kornilov have contacts with several Dutch politicians, he was also  regarded as ""independant expert"" by the Dutch public broadcasting  network NOS. In [this](https://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2096938-wat-vinden-de-oekrainers-zelf-van-het-referendum.html) article he is quoted as a ""political analyst"".

So what new information do we really have? **Nothing.**  The only ""leak"" that we got was a couple whatsapp messages joking about  money without any actual incriminating evidence.

4940,"&gt;The new buildings are usually just as shit-looking as the commieblocks, or even uglier. 

The new buildings have a much better success ratio of actually being built along the roads, having business premises on the ground floor when small businesses and services can operate, utilizing the entire building lot, and if we are lucky, maybe even connecting wall to wall with the buildings on the next lot over (a concept which was apparently alien to commieblock planners because they built everything as standalone buildings). Even if their *architecture* isn't particularly pretty either, those *urbanist* qualities automatically make them infinitely better in my eyes.

&gt;Painting the commieblocks properly is enough to make them look bearable

Painting them makes them less grey, but it doesn't fix their bad urbanism.

Besides, do you expect us to stay behind while you guys destroy countries left and right?

Like you did with ""Russian meddling"" or the entire West with ""it's Chinese fault we didn't do right things"".

&gt; I honestly do not understand why this is still going on in russia. Do you seriously believe that russia cant have a different political system?

Russian political system isn't much different from typical Western neoliberal regimes, and that's a bad thing.

There was none because your countries (and mine too) fell into hands of profit-seeking globalists.

We  can spread it out across Mexico, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, perhaps other Latin American countries, Eastern and Southern Europe, eventually even Africa.

Ideally we'd want as much produced in Europe (imo anyway) but if Vietnam (or whoever) does clothing and shoes really well for example, I see no particular problem with having some of that production there.

The several decades worth of warnings were in relation to food and eating practices, not some sort of breach or mishap at a research institution. No one has been warning about the latter scenario occurring in southern China for decades. As noted in your post, that is a far more recent concern. As it happens, there are actually two institutions in Wuhan that should be of interest to  theorists: the Wuhan Institute of Virology (a biosafety level 4 facility) and the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention (a level 2 facility).  


The problem with all of this is that, to date, there has been no evidence presented that demonstrates any sort of link between this specific virus and these facilities. Who knows?

5192,"No, in Poland you'd be punished if as medical professional in any capacity you were acting against 'current medical knowledge'. It has nothing to do with being 'angry' - at the time everyone with any medical education quickly understood what your CMO and CSO are suggesting is ridiculous, that either they're deliberately misleading public and potentially government, or they're simply extremely incompetent (or acting based on some data we're not privy to, but at least to this day it doesn't seem to be the case).

I don't suggest show trials, or pinning the blame simply because someone is angry. I suggest your CMO and CSO are incompetent political nominees. They have impressive CVs on first glance, but once you dig a bit deeper you quickly realize it's just a fasade... and it really shows. However, they're still your CMO and CSO, and by accepting those positions they also should accept responsibility. You're talking about questions being asked - there should be questions asked, and quite frankly unless UK government has some classified data they are not sharing with the world (at which point I'd ask why the hell they are hiding that data considering its global significance) I don't see any potential for satisfactory answers here. We're talking about really basic lack of understanding, the 'schoolboy error'... except one that caused a lot of unnecessary deaths. They were heavily criticized at the time (at least outside of UK), and virtually nobody drew similar conclusions at the time (again, at least outside of UK). Somehow we all looked at the data from China as well as situation developing at the time in Italy, and immediately understood what we're looking at is largely indicative of failing healthcare systems under tremendous stress. That data we have is basically preliminary battlefield casualty report and should be treated as such. Oh, and so we're clear: that's not ""hindsight"" - that was at the time (February/March) widely accepted stance, as evident by any discussion section of published articles from the period pointing out inherent inaccuracy of the data.

It's equivalent of you going to GP with stomachache, your GP refusing to examine your properly and suggesting trying some essential oils, you dieing from sepsis, and GP saying 'well I wanted to try something new' and 'there was no way of knowing that's so serious'... except on national scale.

5206,"Coronabonds wouldn't change anything about Italy's current interest payments, because it's only about new debt. However, at least you're honest (unlike politicians), because no one wants to have time-limited Coronabonds, but permanent Eurobonds.

You might as well as Germany or other countries to permanently wire tax payer money to Italy. It's basically the same thing.

What you are asking is, why doesn't my friend want to be put on my mortgage, so I only have to pay 1% instead of 2% interest? If I only needed to pay 1%, I could afford it! He doesn't have to pay anything!

Well, that's not how it works. If you default, your friend has to pay. We pretty much know the chances of Italy paying back its debt voluntarily. People complain about austerity. So why the fuck would Italy keep it's current track when interest gets lowered? It wouldn't, Italy would just increase spending (and therefore, debt).

Even worse, Eurobonds also mean that your friend has to pay 1% instead of 0% on his own mortgage. On top of that, this is true for all future debt and your friend has no say whatsover in what you do with the money.

Of course the % figures are not correct, but they get the point accross.

And I didn't even write about any legal issues (e.g. the German constitution, the EU treaty etc).

So what's so complicated? You put it like it's a simple switch to lower interest rates for Italy at no cost to the rest of Europe.

5237,"Very well written. It's nice to see people actually acknowledging that the EU is not an overlaying structure supporting Eurobonds.

I am against Eurobonds and would only support them if they actually were by the EU and we would have a fiscal union, but unfortunately it seems unlikely that the national states are going to give up some of their sovereignty.

I for instance think that Eurobonds are hurting the EU much more in the long run since I see a high risk for some kind of civil war due to the democratic principles lacking.
As I have mentioned in other posts before, even within Germany we don't have any bonds like the proposed Eurobonds. Brandenburg can't take in debts while Bayern ""pays""/garantees for them. The federal republic has nationalwide bonds, they have authority on fiscal decisions and they spend the money and via elections etc everyone has the possibility to have a say in it.

I don't mind helping other countries as Germany. I would love to have a stronger EU and have a federal supranational state with fiscal authority, but unfortunately that's not the case, so I see no chances for Eurobonds",North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany),/r/europe/comments/g2xmp9/interesting_map_of_countries_who_approve_the/fnrdihh/,Blutknecht,1587185756

There is a reason why most people who are against Eurobonds say you need a fiscal union first. Helping others isn't the problem, the missing democratic overlay is the problem. The EU could be that, but for that to happen national states would have to give up their sovereignty on fiscal politics and shift the power towards the EU. Most countries don't want that (both in the north and the south). Without a fiscal union I fear Eurobonds would lead more likely to a civil european war than to fixing the problem.

there’ll be a time when we stop believing what governments are saying  huh?

If me the old ordinary citizen I succeeded found a lot of information on China, videos of the dead body piled up, and of the gravity of the situation that was happening in China ...

You can imagine that French, American and all other European intelligence services were aware of what was going on in China.

They just closed their stopper to not get offended with China (1st economic power)

And then they’re all going to say ""It’s China’s fault"" To clear customs. But they were absolutely all aware. And don't forget that! They all knew!

On the other hand, the only thing that intrigues me is that, ultimately, I see the point of saying nothing so as not to put China on its back. But for once, I do not see their interest in not having anticipated the pandemic in their country, (lack of gear, masks ect) and not having prepared the confinement better than that.

They could very well have said ""all is well in China"" but secretly prepare for what was going to happen. because economically confinement is going to turn into a global economic crisis.

So unless they have already planned drastic post-covid-19 measures, which would suit them all. And that the covid would help them get their new ""law / rules / technology"" across.

No, it's just you who's misinterpreting them. They didn't expect a big increase in infected due to Easter, they expected the number of infected to continue to increase, but instead it [flattened out](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/09f821667ce64bf7be6f9f87457ed9aa).

He's not referring to the frequency, he's referring to the lag between death to official public data.

5338,"MOSCOW/OSLO (Reuters) - Russia on Friday said it had filed a protest to Oslo after Norwegian coastguards detained a Russian trawler near a remote chain of islands in the Arctic earlier this month.

The Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, about 850 km (500 miles) north of mainland Norway, is seen as a potential flashpoint between Moscow and the West as climate change has opened up the resource-rich region.

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Friday Russia was seriously concerned after a Russian fishing vessel named the Borey was detained on April 2, within Norway’s fishery protection zone that Russia considers illegal.

“We believe the practice of detaining foreign vessels by the Norwegian coastguard in the so-called fish protection zone is in line with Norway’s policy of illegally expanding its rights in the archipelago region,” Zakharova was quoted by TASS news agency as saying.
In a statement the Norwegian foreign ministry confirmed the Borey had been arrested by coastguards, saying it was suspected of having contravened Norwegian regulations relating to fishery operations and catches in the fishery protection zone.
“The case was solved under normal procedure at sea and the vessel was released,” the emailed statement added, confirming the ministry had received a verbal protest from Moscow but reiterating the fishery zone had been established legally.

Previous incidents of Russian vessels being detained in the area have been reported in 2003, 2011 and 2016.",,/r/europe/comments/g3fhjx/russia_protests_after_norway_detains_trawler_near/fnqz1rr/,Nunyabeezkneez,1587175395

What I did not knew before (I am German, not American) was how he changed his party membership multiple times and he always switched to the party not in power. It is really weird, because he seems like he was trying to get into power for a while, being a very opportunistic person. He seems so incredibly stupid that I always wonder if he is just a strawman. But a strawman would not change parties that regularly. That his stupidity is partially an act might also be true, but why did he still do so much dumb shit, that did not helped him in any way, not portraying him as a down to earth man and not sending out signs to giving some groups hope that he supports their causes. Some of the stuff he did was just plain stupid.
My theory is that he is smart enough to include some key words in his speeches that some of his advisors told him multiple times to mention. That is the limit that I see in his intelligence. I also watched an Interview with him from the 90s the mental decay is clearly visible.

**Person 2**: They're actually very different from each other and it's not the first time, but I think their foreign policy used to be similar and aligned, so I have no further insight into what may be going on here with the eurobond opinions differentiation all of a sudden.

**Me**: Yes, even though we've made and continue to make different choices and continue to be different, we had a similar starting point, so this could be exploited to glean meaningful data from (and already has been, remember Latvia getting IMF loans vs. Lithuania borrowing in the markets in 2008/9 and then everyone comparing the GDP growths to see which is better?). One of those key differences in foreign policy that exists between Lithuania and Latvia today and, as it happens, could easily explain the different foreign policies on the eurobonds question and resolve our conundrum might be that Lithuania is obsessed with Germany and we want senpai to notice us. Arms procurement contracts have been used to curry political favour since forever - welcome to Politics 101 - and is one of the handful of things off the top of my head that I can quickly name right now *to prove this point* about Lithuania as a country aiming to please Germany (which isn't even being disputed or at risk of being disputed in the comments by absolutely anyone, so I didn't even have to give any proof of my claim).
 
(As you may or may not know, Nausėda's position changed abruptly 2 weeks ago without any explanation given. How likely is it that there was a call from the second Fatherland? Would Merkel even have to call or is it enough that we can see what Germany's stance is and moderate ours to match it automatically, since it's been already established by everyone here that that's what we agree that we want to do because the Germans deserved it due to the Saxon volunteers gifting us freedom and stuff (more likely)).

5431,"1. The First Balkan War started in 1912 but the border change effectively happened in 1913, after the change was recognized by the Ambassadors of the Great Britain, Italy, Germany, Austria-Hungary, France, and Russia in London. The massacres that followed are very well known, but I guess it is normal for a Serb to deny war crimes. You can refer to this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_of_Albanians_in_the_Balkan_Wars), but there are of course much stronger sources within the article that you can refer to. The sources even provide details of events of how the massacres happened. Many of the sources of the time were Russians who disagreed with what their country was supporting there.
2. Now regarding the comparison to North Macedonia, how North Macedonia became a country and Kosovo not, and so on, there is a very detailed study by 2 Serbian historians, Aleksandar Petrovic and Dorde Stefanovic titled ""[Kosovo, 1944-1981: The Rise and Fall of a Communist 'Nested Homeland'](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09668136.2010.497016?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=ceas20)"". I am not going to cite specific parts from that paper, I suggest you to read it all. Every claim that I made regarding the period from 1944 to 1981 is written there in details and they cite other sources, so you can start from there.
3. The part about Oblasts and Banovinas is exactly what I was referring to when I said there were no ethno-states within Yugoslavia. Kosovo was part of Zeta, Raska, Kosovo and Vranje between 1922 and 1929, part of Zeta, Morava and Vardar between 1929 and 1941. In the latter case it was split about equally between the three. You are right about the year, I should have said 1941, not 1939.
4. I did not mention the protests to talk about whining of any sort, but to show that the struggle for independence was continuous. Serbia reacted by suppressing Kosovo's autonomy in 1989, illegally. Had there been minimal democratic accountability, the suppression would NOT have passed. The events that followed proved it. And there were tanks just outside the parliament, in what is today known as the Skanderbeg Square in Prishtina and snipers above the national theatre in front of the parliament. These are facts.
5. About the schooling and so on, it was only enabled thanks to Tito. Until 1941, education in Albanian was ILLEGAL in Kosovo. It was legalized by the Albanian government in 1941 and continued to be legal until 1989, when it was made illegal again and the Albanians switched to a parallel education system. The university was closed too, our current Prime Minister went to jail for protesting in 1997 to open the university. This and point 4 are very recent history, really. You don't need to search any historic literature, a google search sends you straight to the news articles about the events.",Kosovo,/r/europe/comments/g31xsq/today_i_saw_yet_another_map_missing_kosovo_so_i/fnqkkoo/,FWolf14,1587166469

5458,"There has been enough opportunities to limit debt. The past 10 years whole of Europe, including Southern Europe have seen huge economic growth. Spain, Portugal and Greece have shown that at least balancing the full budget and reducing debt was possible. Something Italy didn't do.

Also why do you think that the debt mountain, which Southern Europe freely accepted to create on their own , should be an excuse to stop trying?

Also you talk about a mechanism that allows countries to work/soldier on as normal but also disregarding ESM. ESM allows countries to continue their road, as long conditions are met. Those conditions can be anything. At this moment it's agreed that any European country can get money from ESM for direct AND indirect healthcare costs without ANY conditions. Said loan will cost only 0,76% in yearly interest, which is lower than long term interest of Spain (0,809%), Greece (2,087%) and Italy (1,805%).

Furthermore if southern Europe was ready being financial responsible, then why fear the conditions of the ESM?

Again its great that a majority of southern European countries made effort to implement financial reform. However its really misguided to think that that is so not normal that it should result in Northern Europe bankrolling everything.

Demanding eurobonds is like barging into the house of your friend and demand them to give you €10k right now and that they shouldn't ask questions why. Using ESM is asking your friend nicely if they could pay your rent this shiity month while promising to (continue) trying at being better at balancing your finances.

First of all you completely strawmaned me because I never claimed that most Hungarians would want to secede nor that they would even want autonomy. Neither of them would even make much sense because there are open borders between the two countries. 

My contention with your post is the part where you said that Hungarians are happier in Slovakia than in Hungary which is completely unsubstantiated and also contradicted by the significant decline of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia.  According to the population census, in 2001 there were 520.000 Hungarians in Slovakia while in 2011 that number dropped to 458.000.

5565,"I just have to bring this point up. Do you know why North Macedonia (then Macedonia) was a Republic in Yugoslavia and Kosovo wasn't? Both were part of the Ottoman Empire until they were captured by Serbia in 1913. Both were parts of Serbia before it joined Yugoslavia (the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes). Both had non-Serbian majority. Both were split to many pieces during the experiments between 1919 and 1939 (in which nation-states didn't exist within Yugoslavia). Both were promised the status of Republic or potential separation from Yugoslavia in 1945. Macedonia became a Republic, Kosovo only an autonomous region. Why? Because of internal politics in Yugoslavia.

The Macedonians were seen as ""just enough"" separated from the Bulgarians to be considered another ethnicity. The Kosovar Albanians (who were called Siptari before it was derogatory, not Albanac like the ones in Albania by the Yugoslav authorities) were not seen as different enough compared to the Albanians of Albania. Attempts were made to separate them, but it was said that ""they are Albanians, not another ethnicity."" It was Yugoslavia's policy to not give a 2nd Republic to one ethnic group. So just this ""they are different enough from the Bulgarians"" and ""they are not different enough from the Albanians"" made the difference, though it was relatively subjective. They could have decided differently.

Now I have one question. Why should Kosovo not be a country? It is not like populating a neighborhood of London. It is not like some people taking the weapons and going against a country that they have helped to build, or that has built them. Kosovo never chose to be part of Serbia. Kosovo was against joining Serbia even in 1913, when it was handed over to it, and this can be proven because thousands of people died in war to keep Serbia out in 1912 and 1913. Kosovo's declaration that it did not want to be part of Serbia was written with blood.

Kosovo was taken by Serbia in 1913 by force, through war. Tens of thousands of civilians got massacred in the aftermath. There was war between the population of Kosovo and Serbia between 1912 and 1924, again between 1939 and 1946, followed by protests in the 1950s, 1960s, with a culmination in 1968. Kosovo was granted full autonomy in 1974, even becoming a constituent member of Yugoslavia (just not a Republic, because formally Albanians could not have 2 countries). The people of Kosovo protested again in 1981, asking for full independence. The people of Kosovo did not vote for the illegal suppression of the autonomy in 1989, it was done with tanks. Kosovo declared independence immediately after, again showing its desire to be independent. The war was unavoidable because of the oppression that followed.

There have never been conditions for mutual existence between Kosovo and Serbia. The Serbs always wanted a Kosovo without Albanians, and the Albanians always wanted a Kosovo without Serbia. When I say always, I mean even before Kosovo joined Serbia. Kosovo joining Serbia in 1913 was a mistake, not of the population of Kosovo, but of the great powers that drew the borders. So a struggle for independence that lasted from 1912/13 to 1999/2008 cannot be reduced to ""just some people taking guns and asking for independence"". The lack of independence was a historical accident that had to be corrected eventually. Serbia's discriminatory policies during the entire 20th century made this a must.",Kosovo,/r/europe/comments/g31xsq/today_i_saw_yet_another_map_missing_kosovo_so_i/fnq7qhc/,FWolf14,1587159294

5643,"Good translation is probably AI-hard.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-complete

&gt; In the field of artificial intelligence, the most difficult problems are informally known as *AI-complete* or *AI-hard*, implying that the difficulty of these computational problems, assuming intelligence is computational, is equivalent to that of solving the central artificial intelligence problem—making computers as intelligent as people, or strong AI.[1] To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a simple specific algorithm. 
&gt;
&gt;AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include computer vision, natural language understanding, and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem.[2]

That is, without making an AI that has approximately as full an understanding of the world as a human and comparable capabilities, we cannot have comparable translation.

*But Google Translate!*

Google Translate has done an impressive job achieving results that are, in many cases, good-enough with far less-capable technology.  I can look at a large corpus of existing works and say that it's likely that similar words will be associated with each other here as in other works and make guesses with a limited understanding that are often good-enough.

But there are also things that that just isn't going to work with, ever.  You cannot translate a poem effectively because there is no large body of works that work the same way, and because the writing there is constrained in complex ways and unusual ways.

Capturing the ""feel"" of a political speech is going to be hard, because the literal content is often less-important than the emotion it evokes, and that relies on an understanding of the impact that particular phrase has in a culture.  

Most people on this sub speak at least one language other than English.  My guess is that few would enjoy watching a movie whose lines had been automatically-translated.

Automated translation has gone for the low-hanging fruit.  And it's done a good job at getting that low-hanging fruit.  But I am confident that in twenty years, there will still be humans translating things.  Well, absent human-level AI, and if that happens, a great many other things will also change, since things like the world's military balance and basic structure of society may also be up for grabs.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/g2zhra/bulgarian_deputy_pm_eastern_europe_could_replace/fnpu50t/,duisThias,1587152047

5686,"&gt;The stagnancy happened in non-European parts of the western world too though. It's not necessarily just the expansion that caused it.

Western non-european? So basically the US + Anglosphere - UK. Considering that's like five countries I don't know how representative that is. Anyway, I don't think the main cause of the stagnancy is the expansion, though that did play some role and hit specific sectors very hard. Mainly I point at the stagnancy in frustration when people create a narrative of W-Europe getting rich out of exploiting the East. It just isn't grounded in the lives of people here.  

&gt;Also, how much stagnating is bad depends on what level you are stagnating on

There is an interesting psychological dimension in fearing that the next generations will have a worse life than the present one. It isn't entirely rational but societies that expect things to improve can have a certain level of optimism and energy that doesn't exists the other way around. 

Stagnation with a growing debt is just a precursor to disaster even if the country is relatively wealthy. 

&gt;I would like to point out that we aren't thrilled that we have to compete through low salaries either you know. We would like to change that

I don't blame you in the slightest for using the strong cards you have, as any nation should. It will take time for the past to be repaired. But the reality you can use those cards efficiently should also be a bit of counterpoint to the perception that the relationship beween West and East is exploitative.

&gt;I recognize we have some role in that as well (in pushing the south around)

Eastern European role in that is telling W-N-Europe (the names start to become a bit comical) that they should fix the matter while doing nothing themselves. Redirecting the -not yet spend- Cohesion funds based on the impact of the virus would have made a lot of sense. Instead Poland got more money from the EU than Italy did because that is *obviously* where the epicenter was. Yet it is the North getting all the flack and demands/ultimatums.

Maybe the country that didn't go through a recession when half the planet did should have some financial reserves it can spend for their Southern comrades. We aren't far away from a debt death spiral ourselves yet Poland with a higher gdp and half our debt to gdp ratio gets to sit back and relax.

Well,i guess i will see proofs of anything you just said,i mean:

1. ""interferences' are 'highly likely'. No proofs.
2. Photos of Russian military in Ukraine. ISIS got thousands of videos of Russian Aerospace Forces bombing the shit out of them. Ukrainians does not. For 6 years.
3. Intelligence services also register Russian submarines. Which happen to be not just not Russian,but not submarines. No proofs,as always
4. Also,its pretty hillarious to hear about goverment institutions,when european sanctions literally aimed at common people.

Let's now think about MH17.

First of all - it's a tragedy for everyone involved,and i hope it won't happen again in any shape or form.

Now closely about the issue.

We have all NATO-related media constantly talking about Russia,in as bad way as it possible. Also,NATO have satellites all over the world,especially in important to them conflict zones. In summary - big part of the world ready to accept anything atleast relatively close to truth to blame Russia for MH17. But we still have no evidence,but shady numbered witnesses,no flight controller,and a country who already downed civilian plane.

In my opinion,we wil not see any evidence as long as Ukraine are american project.

5724,"&gt; It's relevant because Serbs claim Kosovo based on a 14th century claim, as if it gives Serbia an eternal right by God to rule over a specific piece of land in perpetuity.  

That's only part of the story. That only refers to Serbia's historical claim on the region. The legal (which bears the brunt of the weight) is the fact that it has been part of Serbia since 1912 this claim was reaffirmed by the UN to resolution 1244. Meanwhile the Albanians' claim on Kosovo is purely based on ethnic majority.

&gt; Thessaloniki had a majority Greek population, so naturally they'd be part of Greece, so it's a poor example. 

The city's demographics was mixed. Greeks made a plurality but there were many Turks, Slavic Macedonians and Jews. Not to mention the rest of Agean Macedonia where in many municipalities  Slavs represented the majority. But that just underlines my main point, that its impossible to draw the borders based on ethnic lines. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;   but Serbia obviously gave 0 shits about what the majority people of Kosovo wanted and annexed it anyway. 

Why would they? Did the Turks give two shits when they conquered Kosovo from Serbia? No. Do the Albanians in Kosovo give two shits about what Serbs think in Northern Kosovo? NO. So let's stop pretending that any of this has anything to do with some democratic referendum, especially in 1912 when about 25% of Kosovo's population even knew how to read and write. It's extremely cynical on your part.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Thankfully, that didn't happen, and thankfully one century later Kosovo is under the control of its own people rather than an irredentist country wanting 14th century borders in the 21st century.

Is Bavaria wasn't able to pay that money Germany can say ""yeah we still want take that.."".

However, a small tips is to at least read the conclusion of an economic paper if you want to insult someone with it. It is some extra work, but it is absolutely worth it, just in case anyone for some unexplainable reason would actually be interested in the topic discussed. I know it seldom happens, but you never know!

&gt;The Swedish and Finnish GDP data do suggest that the different choices on the monetary regime have not been very important from a macroeconomic perspective. Until 2009 the average growth was almost identical. In 2009 and 2010, the independent monetary regime buffered the impact of the global shock on Sweden. The different monetary regimes cannot, however, explain the steadily increased growth gap anymore in 2012. Other factors, such as the decline of the Nokia cluster, are needed for that.
Our simulation exercise suggests that the stabilisation of Swedish output in 2009 and 2010 emanates at least as much from the reaction of the exchange rate as from the movements of the short-term rates. It is not obvious that the foreign exchange market reactions would always be stabilising.

&gt;In any case, Sweden had achieved a lower average inflation rate in the EMU period and in fact improved its price stability more than Finland did, if compared to the years prior to the EMU. Thus, as a whole, monetary independence has not been detrimental to macroeconomic stability in Sweden. If anything, Sweden has fared somewhat better than it had done in the EMU and definitely better than Finland. As the Swedish economy is bigger and more versatile than that of Finland, this is not yet conclusive evidence that Finland would have achieved a similar outcome outside the EMU. Also, the proximity and closer economic links to Russia could make financial market conditions in a non-euro Finland more volatile than those in Sweden. Nevertheless, our observations do not support the argument that being part of the EMU is necessary for the macroeconomic stability of a small EU country with sound fiscal policies and resilient economic structures.
Interestingly, public opinions in both countries seem to support the monetary regime choices. In Sweden the support for joining the euro has declined strongly since the start of the Great Recession and has remained at around 10 per cent only since November 2011 (SCB 2013). In Finland, the support for the euro has at the same time been near all-time-high (Haavisto, 2013). One interpretation is that, as in the 1990s, economic arguments are predominant in Sweden and the euro crisis has added to the suspicions about the EMU, while political arguments continue to dominate in Finland.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/g2xmp9/interesting_map_of_countries_who_approve_the/fnp0dro/,Thelastgoodemperor,1587136999

Although it is true they were not among the best prepared. We really should applaud their transparency &amp; efforts !

Very few countries have actually come though with their promise to consistently communicate the data related to death in retirement homes.

Belgium is the only country with France for which I have found clear and updated data on their government website. 

After a very shaky first week, France has done a rather good job when collecting data from retirement homes. Although it is expected to still be partial, they do publish the hospital death tally daily and the consolidated data from retirement homes weekly. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- France ( pop : 67M ) : **11 060** in hospitals + 6860 in retirement homes \[17/04\]

\- UK ( pop : 67M) :  **13,729**  deaths in hospital  + ????

\- Spain ( pop :  47M) : **19,130**  Fallecidos in hospitals ?

\- Belgium ( pop 10M ) : **2379** in hospitals+ 2387 in retirement homes

&amp;#x200B;

This unfortunately has a potential ""political"" cost . For instance I had a friend asking me why the situation was so must worst in France than in the UK and in the EU. 

I had to explain to him why it was clearly not the case and that base on the concrete data available so far, France health system was actually one of the most efficient at dealing with the pandemic when compared to countries with similar population. Germany being for obvious reason a shining exception.

Shitty websites like [worldometers.info](https://worldometers.info) and too many tabloid do a very poor job when handling those numbers and communicate it without proper explanations to the general public. 

This contribute to an increasing distrust of the public health authorities and a borderline paranoia in part of the population.

Hats off to the governments of Belgium that actually try to collect &amp; publish those data.

Those discrepancies is  one of the many reason it is difficult to compare the situation  in different countries. Making all  the more difficult to build  effective projection/models.

The  worst case will probably be the US since in addition to technical and  logistical issues when collecting data, there is a big political issue at play. Many republican governors were reluctant to properly enforce  any confinement or help to properly collect the data in   hospitals, let alone in retirement homes.

Time will come in a few month to properly assess and reflect on the way each governments handled the crisis, but right now lets encourage governments that are trying to be transparent ( even though it might  cost them due to the confusion in the media and among the general public) .",,/r/europe/comments/g30xwv/belgium_says_transparency_explains_high_virus/fnp0hra/,logmarc,1587137056

Sorry, but I really don't care who lived there 600 years ago, I'm more concerned about who lives there now. If we go by your logic, before Belgrade and Nish were ever a part of Serbia, they was a part of Bulgaria. Hell, the Bulgarians even controlled Nish and Kosovo before you did!

Vojvodina was part of the kingdom of Hungary, never part of Serbia before 20th century. Bosnia was part of the kingdom of Croatia but Serbs had no problem declaring a republic there, tried to do the same in Croatia.

North Macedonia, especially Ohrid was the heartland of the Bulgarian Empire and archbishopric of Ohrid, Serbs had no trouble taking North Macedonia for themselves and making the Archbishopric of Ohrid their own.

Please dude, if you're going to say that just because Kosovo was a part of Serbia in the fucking 1300's that it should be yours forever, don't be hypocritical and give Vojvodina to the Hungarians, Nish and Belgrade to the Bulgarians, and live happily ever after in Rashka when every country gets their ""rightful"" land.",Albanian from North Macedonia,/r/europe/comments/g31xsq/today_i_saw_yet_another_map_missing_kosovo_so_i/fnp0oru/,__sovereign__,1587137158

5827,"You sound extremely confused on certain theories and i believe the lack of a proper vernacular makes your argument completely chaotic and incomprehensible. 

If i understand you correctly, you are saying that a homogeneous society will create a virtuous spiral, therefore better economic development and an easier access to the market. 

As a counter argument you use francophone ex-colonies...not sure what that has to do with the original argument, but here you don't  discuss the homogeneity of the society or not, but the involvement of a third nation in its economic development (?). 

So now that I hope i understood what you wrote, although i'm still unsure of what you are trying to say, i'll try and respond.

The homogeneity of a society doesn't have an influence in the economic development of a country. This is proven historically. Italy has never been homogeneous, and is the 8th richest country on the planet. Spain was not when it became a worldwide reaching Kingdom. The US have never been homogeneous and the richer states are still the ones in which minorities have had the possibility to develop their own business, like the Northern states. 
Countries are rich or poor because of their inclusive political and economical institutions. if you treat your people fair, no matter their cultural heritage, you will create prosperity. 

African states tend to have extractive political institutions, the Mugabes and Debys who have always extracted richness from their populace. While countries with inclusive institutions, like Botswana are much richer, even though they aren't homogenous and consis of culturally different tribes.

Also, Japan didn't prosper because of homogeneity, but because Toshimichi managed to overthrow feudalism, the Perry expedition in 1853 whilst maintaining their traditions in a reformed shinto. 
The homogeneity is a result of insular mentality, not an attempt at safeguarding their economy, which - despite your argument for homogeneity as a possible example - is suffering enormously. 

Germany's modern Wirtschaftswunder started in the 50s and although you claim it is because of underpaid foreigners, it is  because of an inclusive economical ecosystem. You also claimed that Turkey or turkish people are not represented in German politics but forgot that the son of Turkish immigrants, Cez Özdemir was one of the CHAIRMANS of the Green party in Germany...not just a member. the Chairman. 


To summarize: economic development is a result governmental mismanagement, historical events, institutional structures or geographical locations - not Homogeneity in population. You are trying to push your culturism but aren't educated enough to support it. 
PLUS...economic development has nothing to do with our discussion on public debt, which is related to public finances and the management of these. So, all your arguments fall flat, since the sustainability of the debt is dependent on international trade regulations.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/g2xz52/the_long_italian_surplus/fnp1028/,Obazda,1587137321

5848,"&gt; ""High"" is a relative value. Italys inflation rate at the time is high relative to current standards, but it wasn't insanely high relative to the standards of the day. As I said. It was just somewhat higher than many countries. Even Denmark, the USA and Sweden experienced double digit inflation at at the time btw.

There is a big difference between ""double digit inflation"" and over 20%. At 10% inflation, your currency will be worth 35% after 10 years. At 20%, its 10.7%. That's a world of a difference.

My point was more that if more people were more involved  with the steps between rearing an animal and it ending up on their plate they might be willing to pay more in order to raise welfare standards.

For me the ultimate welfare standard is an animal that has lived all it's life in a truly natural habitat (which is why I mentioned it). With the opposite end of the spectrum being an animal which has been reared in a cage, in a shed, and has never seen the light of day.

The first would cost a ludicrous sum in order to feed a large population so isn't remotely feasible, the other is again at the complete opposite end of the spectrum but is closer to where we are currently.
